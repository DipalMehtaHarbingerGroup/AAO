			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The 193-nm argon-&#173;fluoride (ArF) excimer laser treats refractive error by ablating the anterior corneal stroma to create a new radius of curvature. Two major refractive surgical techniques use excimer laser ablation. In <span class="italic">surface ablation</span> techniques, including photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK), and epipolis laser in situ keratomileusis (epi-&#173;LASIK), the Bowman layer is exposed either by debriding the epithelium through various methods or by loosening and moving, but attempting to preserve, the epithelium. In LASIK, the excimer laser ablation is performed under a lamellar flap that is created with either a mechanical microkeratome or a femtosecond laser. Excimer laser ablation algorithms can be classified generally as conventional, wavefront-&#173;optimized, wavefront-&#173;guided, and topography-&#173;guided.</p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Excimer Laser</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top1">
			<p class="h2-h1">Background</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The excimer laser uses a high-&#173;voltage electrical charge to transiently combine atoms of excited argon and fluorine; when the molecule, or dimer, reverts to its separate atoms, a charged photon is emitted. The word <span class="italic">excimer</span> comes from “<span class="italic">exc</span>ited d<span class="italic">imer</span>.” Srinivasan, an IBM engineer, was studying the far-&#173;ultraviolet (UV; 193-nm) ArF excimer laser for photoetching of computer chips. He and Trokel, an ophthalmologist, not only showed that the excimer laser could remove corneal tissue precisely with minimal adjacent corneal damage—<span class="italic">photoablation</span>—but they also recognized its potential use for refractive and therapeutic corneal surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Photoablation, the removal of corneal tissue with minimal adjacent corneal damage, occurs because the cornea has an extremely high absorption coefficient at 193&#160;nm. A single 193-nm photon has sufficient energy to directly break carbon–carbon and carbon–<br />nitrogen bonds that form the peptide backbone of the corneal collagen molecules. Excimer laser radiation ruptures the collagen polymer into small fragments, expelling a discrete volume and depth of corneal tissue from the surface with each pulse of the laser (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-1</span>) without significantly damaging adjacent tissue.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Surface Ablation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Surface ablation procedures were initially performed as PRK, the sculpting of the de-&#173;epithelialized corneal stroma to alter refractive power, and they underwent extensive preclinical investigation before being applied to sighted human eyes. Results of early animal studies provided evidence of relatively normal wound healing in laser-&#173;ablated corneas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The popularity of PRK decreased in the late 1990s when LASIK began to be performed because of LASIK’s faster recovery of vision and decreased postoperative discomfort. Although more LASIK than surface ablation procedures are still performed, the number of surface ablations has increased in recent years. PRK remains an especially attractive alternative for specific indications, including irregular or thin corneas; epithelial basement membrane disease (often called <span class="italic">map-dot-&#173;fingerprint dystrophy</span>); previous corneal surgery, such as penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and radial keratotomy (RK); and treatment of some LASIK flap complications, such as incomplete or buttonholed flaps. Surface ablation eliminates the potential for stromal flap–related complications and may have a decreased incidence of postoperative dry eye as compared to LASIK. Corneal haze, the major risk of PRK, decreased markedly with the use of adjunctive mitomycin&#160;C; subsequently, the use of PRK for higher levels of myopia has increased.</p>

			<p class="h2">LASIK</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">keratomileusis</span> comes from the Greek words for “cornea” <span class="italic">(kerato)</span> and “to carve” <span class="italic">(mileusis).</span> <span class="italic">Laser in situ keratomileusis,</span> which combines keratomileusis with excimer laser stromal ablation, is currently the most frequently performed keratorefractive procedure because of its safety, efficacy, quick recovery of vision, and minimal patient discomfort. LASIK combines 2&#160;refractive technologies: excimer laser stromal ablation and creation of a stromal flap.</p>
			<p class="h2">Wavefront-Guided, Wavefront-Optimized, and Topography-Guided Ablations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conventional excimer laser ablation treats lower-&#173;order, or spherocylindrical, aberrations such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. These lower-&#173;order aberrations constitute approximately 90% of all aberrations. Higher-&#173;order aberrations make up the remainder; such aberrations cannot be treated with glasses. Some ophthalmologists feel that small amounts of higher-&#173;order aberrations, which are commonly found in patients with excellent uncorrected vision, may not adversely affect their vision. Higher-&#173;order aberrations are also a by-&#173;product of excimer laser ablation. Some higher-&#173;order aberrations can cause symptoms—such as loss of contrast sensitivity and nighttime halos and glare—that decrease the quality of vision. The aberrations most commonly associated with these visual concerns are spherical aberration and coma. See Chapter&#160;1 for more detailed discussion of higher-&#173;order aberrations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In an effort to reduce preexisting aberrations and minimize the induction of new aberrations, <span class="italic">wavefront-&#173;guided</span> ablation creates ablation profiles that are customized for individual patients. In addition to addressing higher-&#173;order aberrations, wavefront-&#173;guided treatments can correct the lower-&#173;order aberrations of spherical error and astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Wavefront-&#173;optimized</span> lasers do not use patient-&#173;specific wavefront data. Instead, they adjust the ablation profile of conventional treatments to create a more prolate shape with the additional peripheral ablation in the myopic patient, thereby reducing spherical aberration; however, they have no effect on other higher-&#173;order aberrations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Compared with conventional excimer laser ablation, wavefront-&#173;guided ablations and wavefront-&#173;optimized ablations appear to offer better contrast sensitivity and induce fewer postoperative higher-&#173;order aberrations. Although advances in aberrometry and registration systems have led to improved outcomes, patients who undergo photoablation may still have more higher-&#173;order aberrations postoperatively than they did preoperatively. Wavefront-&#173;guided ablations in general remove more tissue than conventional ablations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Wavefront-&#173;guided ablation appears to have clear-cut benefit compared with wavefront-&#173;optimized ablation only for patients with significant preoperative higher-&#173;order aberrations. The procedure is not suitable for all patients and may be inappropriate for use after cataract surgery, particularly with multifocal intraocular lenses. Intraocular lenses, especially multifocal intraocular lenses, interfere with capturing the wavefront scan and could result in the delivery of an inaccurate treatment. In addition, wavefront data may be impossible to obtain in highly irregular corneas or in eyes with small pupils.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Topography-guided ablations have recently been approved by the US&#160;Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Topography-&#173;guided systems use corneal topography data to create ablation profiles that treat existing corneal shape irregularities and optimize corneal curvature. Topography-&#173;guided ablations have gained traction outside the US in the treatment of corneas with irregular surfaces, such as those with small or decentered optical zones from prior excimer ablations, LASIK flap complications, or post-RK corneal irregularities. Data from a recent FDA clinical trial, demonstrated that topography-&#173;guided ablations may result in excellent outcomes for even routine laser vision correction cases in previously unoperated eyes.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Patient Selection for Photoablation</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The preoperative evaluation of patients considering refractive surgery is presented in detail in Chapter&#160;2. <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;5-1</span> lists relative contraindications to photoablation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Special Considerations for Surface Ablation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In general, any condition that significantly delays epithelial healing is a relative contraindication to surface ablation. Although keloid scar formation was listed as a contraindication to PRK in FDA trials, 1&#160;study found that African Americans with a history of keloid formation did well after PRK, and keloid formation is no longer considered a contraindication to surface ablation or LASIK. Historically, patients taking isotretinoin or amiodarone hydrochloride were excluded from undergoing excimer laser procedures, although there is little evidence that these drugs adversely affect laser keratorefractive outcomes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (EBMD) are better candidates for surface ablation than for LASIK because surface ablation may be therapeutic, reducing epithelial irregularity and improving postoperative quality of vision while enhancing epithelial adhesion. In contrast, LASIK may cause a frank epithelial defect in eyes with EBMD, especially when performed with a mechanical microkeratome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any patient undergoing excimer laser photoablation should have a pachymetric and topographic evaluation (see Chapter&#160;2). Younger patients and patients with thin corneas, low predicted residual stromal bed (RSB) thickness, or irregular topography may be at increased risk for the development of ectasia with LASIK. As such, these patients may be better candidates for surface ablation. Patients with subtle topographic pattern abnormalities need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In some circumstances, patients who are stable may be offered surface ablation but with a clear acknowledgment, as well as a signed informed consent form, that they understand there may still be a risk of progression to corneal ectasia.</p>

			<p class="h2">Special Considerations for LASIK</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The preoperative evaluation of patients for LASIK is similar to that for surface ablation. A narrow palpebral fissure and a prominent brow with deep-set globes increase the difficulty of creating a successful corneal flap. The presence of either may lead a surgeon to consider surface ablation over LASIK.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many reports indicate that postoperative dry eye due to corneal denervation is more common with LASIK than with surface ablation. This difference is important to remember when considering refractive surgery in a patient with known dry eye syndrome. Nevertheless, many patients undergoing PRK will also experience postoperative dry eye; however, it is believed that this occurs to a lesser extent than for LASIK patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal topography must be performed to assess corneal cylinder and rule out the presence of forme fruste keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, or contact lens–induced corneal warpage. Corneas steeper than 48.00&#160;D are more likely to have thin flaps or frank buttonholes (central perforation of the flap) with procedures using mechanical microkeratomes. Corneas flatter than 40.00&#160;D are more likely to have smaller-&#173;diameter flaps and are at increased risk for creation of a free cap due to transection of the hinge with mechanical microkeratomes. These problems may be reduced by using a smaller or larger suction ring, which changes the flap diameter; modifying the hinge length; slowing passage of the microkeratome to create a thicker flap or using a microkeratome head designed to create thicker flaps; applying higher suction levels and creating a higher intraocular pressure (IOP); or selecting a femtosecond laser to create the lamellar flap. If a patient is having both eyes treated in a single session, the surgeon must be aware that using the same microkeratome blade to create the flap in the second eye typically results in a flap that is 10–20&#160;µm thinner than the flap in the first eye. In addition, there is some concern about transferring epithelium and/or infectious agents between eyes. These specific concerns are greatly minimized with the use of a femtosecond laser for flap creation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Preoperative pachymetric measurement of corneal thickness is mandatory because an adequate stromal bed must remain to decrease the possibility of postoperative corneal ectasia, although the definition of what constitutes an adequate RSB remains controversial. The following formula is used to calculate the RSB:</p>
			<p class="equation-single ParaOverride-6">RSB = Central Corneal Thickness – Thickness of Flap – Depth of Ablation</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although most practitioners use a minimum RSB of 250&#160;µm as a guideline, this figure is clinically derived rather than based on any definitive laboratory investigations or controlled prospective studies. A thicker stromal bed after ablation does not guarantee that postoperative corneal ectasia will not develop. Moreover, the actual LASIK flap may be thicker than that noted on the label of the microkeratome head, making the stromal bed thinner than the calculated minimum of 250&#160;µm. Consequently, many surgeons use intraoperative pachymetry—especially for high myopic corrections, enhancements, or thin corneas—to determine actual flap thickness.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Determining flap thickness and RSB via intraoperative pachymetry, rather than by estimating thickness based on the markings on the plate, provides the most accurate data. This is accomplished by measuring the central corneal thickness at the beginning of the procedure, creating the LASIK flap with the surgeon’s instrument of choice, lifting the flap, measuring the untreated stromal bed, and subtracting the intended thickness of corneal ablation from the stromal bed to ascertain whether the RSB will be 250&#160;µm or whatever safe threshold is desired following ablation. Flap thickness is then calculated by subtracting the untreated stromal bed measurement from the initial central corneal thickness. It is important to measure the corneal bed thickness quickly after making the flap in order to avoid corneal thinning from exposure to the air.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgeon should preoperatively inform patients with thinner corneas or higher corrections that future LASIK enhancement may not be possible because of an inadequate RSB. These patients may be better candidates for surface ablation enhancements if needed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many ophthalmologists believe that excessive corneal flattening or steepening after LASIK may reduce vision quality and increase aberrations. Thus, many of them avoid creating overly flat or overly steep corneas, although no established guidelines are available on the specific values to avoid. The surgeon can estimate the postoperative keratometry by calculating a flattening of 0.80&#160;D for every diopter of myopia treated and a steepening of 1.00&#160;D for every diopter of hyperopia treated (see Chapter&#160;2).</p>
			<p class="body-text">If wavefront-&#173;guided laser ablation is planned, wavefront error is measured preoperatively, as discussed in Chapter&#160;1. Although wavefront data are used to program the laser, the surgeon must still compare these data to the manifest refraction before surgery to prevent data-&#173;input errors. In general, substantial differences between the manifest refraction and the wavefront refraction should alert the surgeon to a potentially poor candidate for the procedure.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Surgical Technique for Photoablation</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many of the steps in keratorefractive surgery are identical for surface ablation and LASIK. These include calibration and programming of the laser and patient preparation. The major difference between surface ablation and LASIK is preparation for ablation, which is by exposure of the Bowman layer for surface ablation and the midstroma for LASIK. A list of FDA-&#173;approved lasers for refractive surgery can be found on the FDA website.</p>
			<p class="reference-single--no-space- ParaOverride-8">US Food &amp; Drug Administration. List of FDA-&#173;approved lasers for LASIK. Medical Devices website. Published August&#160;17, 2015. Available at https://goo.gl/WvNaRY. Accessed November&#160;5, 2016.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Calibration of the Excimer Laser</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">At the start of each surgery day and between patients, the technician should check the laser for proper homogeneous beam profile, alignment, and power output, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Ultimately, however, it is the surgeon’s responsibility to ensure that the laser is functioning correctly before treating each patient.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Preoperative Planning and Laser Programming</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An important part of preoperative planning is programming the laser with the appropriate refraction. Often, the patient’s manifest and cycloplegic refractions differ, or the amount and axis of astigmatism differ between the topographic evaluation and refractive examination. Thus, it may be unclear which refractive data to enter into the laser. The surgeon’s decision about whether to use the manifest or the cycloplegic refraction is based on his or her individual nomogram and technique. The manifest refraction is more accurate than the cycloplegic refraction in determining cylinder axis and amount. If the refractive cylinder is confirmed to differ from the topographic cylinder, lenticular astigmatism or posterior corneal curvature is assumed to be the cause. In this case, the laser is still programmed with the axis and amount of cylinder noted on refraction. The surgeon should take particular care to check the axis obtained on the refraction with the value programmed into the laser. Entering an incorrect value is a potential source of error, particularly when converting between plus and minus cylinder formats. Before each surgery, the surgeon and the technician should review a checklist of information, confirming the patient’s name, the refraction, and the eye on which surgery is to be performed. In wavefront procedures, the treatment should correspond to the patient’s refraction, and adjustments may be required to compensate for accommodation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For many laser models, the surgeon also must enter the size of the optical zone and indicate whether a blend of the ablation zone should be performed. The <span class="italic">blend zone</span> is an area of peripheral asphericity designed to reduce the possible undesirable effects of an abrupt transition from the optical zone to the untreated cornea (see Fig&#160;5-1B). A prolate blend zone reduces the risk of glare and halo after excimer laser photoablation.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Special considerations for wavefront-guided techniques</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several wavefront mapping systems and wavefront-&#173;guided lasers are available commercially. Wavefront mapping systems are unique to the specific wavefront-&#173;guided laser used. Calibration should be performed according to the manufacturer’s specifications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For wavefront-&#173;guided ablations, the wavefront maps are taken with the patient sitting up at an aberrometer under scotopic conditions; the mapping results are then applied to the cornea in the laser suite with the patient lying down under the operating microscope. Some systems require pupillary dilation to capture wavefront data. The wavefront refraction indicated on wavefront analysis is then compared with the manifest refraction. If the difference between them exceeds 0.75&#160;D, the manifest refraction and the wavefront analysis may need to be repeated. The data are either electronically transferred to the laser or downloaded to a portable drive and then transferred to the laser. Unlike conventional or wavefront-&#173;optimized excimer laser treatment, in which the manifest or cycloplegic refraction is used to program the laser, wavefront-&#173;guided laser treatment uses programmed wavefront data to create a custom ablation pattern.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Preoperative Preparation of the Patient</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many surgeons administer topical antibiotic prophylaxis preoperatively. The patient’s skin is prepared with povidone-&#173;iodine, 5%–10%, or alcohol wipes before or after the patient enters the laser suite, and povidone-&#173;iodine solution, 5%, is sometimes applied as drops to the ocular surface and then irrigated out for further antisepsis. There is no consensus about the utility of these measures. When preparing the patient, the surgeon should take care to avoid irritation of the conjunctiva, which could lead to swelling of the conjunctiva and difficulties with suction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, before laser treatment, patients should be informed about the sounds and smells they will experience during the laser treatment. They may receive an oral antianxiety medication, such as diazepam.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If substantial astigmatism is being treated, some surgeons mark the cornea at the horizontal or vertical axis while the patient is sitting up to ensure accurate alignment under the laser. This step is done to compensate for the cyclotorsion that commonly occurs when the patient changes from a sitting to a lying position. A 15° offset in the axis of treatment can decrease the effective cylinder change by 35% and can result in a significant axis shift. There are multiple methods for marking the cornea or limbus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the patient is positioned under the laser, a sterile drape may be placed over the skin and eyelashes according to the surgeon’s preference. Before doing so, a “time-out” should be performed during which the correct patient is identified, and the treatment and eye(s) to which treatment will be performed are confirmed. Topical anesthetic drops are placed in the eye; for LASIK patients, care should be taken to ensure that the drops are not instilled too early, as doing so may loosen the epithelium substantially. An eyelid speculum is placed in the eye to be treated, and an opaque patch is placed over the fellow eye to avoid cross-&#173;fixation. A gauze pad may be taped over the temple between the eye to be treated and the ear to absorb any excess fluid. The patient is asked to fixate on the laser centration light while the surgeon reduces ambient illumination from the microscope, focuses on the cornea, and centers the laser. It is important for the plane of the eye to remain parallel to the plane of the laser, for the patient to maintain fixation, and for the surgeon to control centration even when using lasers with tracking systems. For most patients, voluntary fixation during photoablation produces more accurate centration than globe immobilization by the surgeon.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Preparation of the Bowman Layer or Stromal Bed for Excimer Ablation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The next surgical step for all excimer photoablation procedures is preparation of the cornea for ablation. With surface ablation procedures, such preparation consists of epithelial removal to expose the Bowman layer. With LASIK, preparation involves the creation of a lamellar flap with a mechanical microkeratome or a femtosecond laser to expose the central stroma.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Epithelial debridement techniques for surface ablation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The epithelium can be removed with</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-12">a sharp blade</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">a blunt spatula</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">a rotary corneal brush</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;5-2</span> shows de-&#173;epithelialization techniques. In both transepithelial ablation and epi-&#173;LASIK, the peripheral margin of de-&#173;epithelialization is defined by the laser or epi-&#173;keratome itself. For other epithelial debridement techniques, the surgeon often defines the outer limit of de-&#173;epithelialization with an optical zone marker and then debrides from the periphery toward the center. An ophthalmic surgical cellulose sponge can be brushed uniformly over the surface of the cornea to remove any residual epithelium and provide a smooth surface. The epithelium should be removed efficiently and consistently to prevent hydration changes in the stroma, because excessive corneal stromal dehydration may increase the amount of tissue removed and lead to overcorrection. The laser treatment zone must be free of epithelial cells, debris, and excess fluid before ablation.</p>

			<p class="h3">Epithelial preservation techniques</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-13"><span class="h4-head">LASEK</span> In the LASEK variant of surface ablation, the goal is to preserve the patient’s epithelium. Instead of debriding and discarding the epithelium or ablating the epithelium with the excimer laser, the surgeon loosens the epithelium with 20% alcohol for 20&#160;seconds and folds back an intact sheet of epithelium.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Epi-LASIK</span> In epi-&#173;LASIK, an epithelial flap is fashioned with a microkeratome fitted with a blunt epikeratome and a thin applanation plate that mechanically separates the epithelium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the goal of LASEK and epi-&#173;LASIK is to reduce postoperative pain, speed the recovery of visual acuity, and decrease postoperative haze formation compared with PRK, controlled studies have had mixed results. In addition, the epithelial flap may not remain viable and may slough off, actually delaying healing and vision recovery. To date, epi-&#173;LASIK and LASEK have not proved to be superior to PRK in reducing corneal haze.</p>

			<p class="h3">Flap creation for LASIK</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lamellar flap creation can be performed using a mechanical microkeratome or a femtosecond laser. Many surgeons make asymmetric sterile ink marks in the corneal periphery, away from the intended flap hinge, just before placement of the suction ring. These marks can aid in alignment of the flap at the end of surgery and in proper orientation in the rare event of a free cap.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Microkeratome</span> Before each surgery, the microkeratome and vacuum unit are assembled, carefully inspected, and tested to ensure proper functioning. The importance of meticulously maintaining the microkeratome and carefully following the manufacturer’s recommendations cannot be overemphasized.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The basic principles of the microkeratome and the role of the suction ring and cutting head are illustrated in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;5-3</span>. The suction ring has 2&#160;functions: (1)&#160;to adhere to the globe, providing a stable platform for the microkeratome cutting head, and (2)&#160;to raise the IOP to a high level, which stabilizes the cornea. The dimensions of the suction ring determine the diameter of the flap and the size of the stabilizing hinge. The thicker the vertical dimension of the suction ring and the smaller the diameter of the ring opening, the less the cornea will protrude, and hence a smaller-&#173;diameter flap will be produced. The suction ring is connected to a vacuum pump, which typically is controlled by an on–off foot pedal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The microkeratome cutting head has several key components. Its highly sharpened, disposable cutting blade is discarded after each patient, either after treatment of a single eye (if the patient is only having a single eye treated or if the surgeon chooses to discard the blade after the first eye) or after bilateral treatment. It is common practice to use the same blade on the second eye of the same patient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The applanation head, or plate, serves to flatten the cornea in advance of the cutting blade. The length of the blade that extends beyond the applanation plate and the clearance between the blade and the applanation surface are the principal determinants of flap thickness. The motor, either electrical or gas-&#173;driven turbine, oscillates the blade rapidly, typically between 6000 and 15,000&#160;cycles per minute. The same motor or a second motor is used to mechanically advance the cutting head, which is attached to the suction ring, across the cornea, although in some models the surgeon manually controls the advance of the cutting head. Smaller and thinner flap size and longer hinge cord length may be more important than hinge location in sparing the nerves and reducing the incidence and severity of dry eyes. Regardless of hinge type, patients generally recover most corneal sensation to preoperative levels within 6–12&#160;months after surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once the ring is properly positioned, suction is activated (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-4</span>). The patient should be notified prior to surgery that when the suction is applied, there may be some discomfort and vision may diminish temporarily. The IOP should be assessed at this point; low IOP can result in a poor-&#173;quality, thin, or incomplete flap. It is essential to have both excellent exposure of the eye, allowing free movement of the microkeratome, and proper suction ring fixation. Inadequate suction may result from blockage of the suction ports caused by eyelashes under the suction ring or redundant or scarred conjunctiva. To avoid the possibility of pseudosuction (occlusion of the suction port with conjunctiva but not sclera), the surgeon can confirm the presence of true suction by observing that the eye moves when the suction ring is gently moved, the pupil is mildly dilated, and the patient can no longer see the fixation light. Methods used to assess whether the IOP is adequately elevated include use of a handheld Barraquer plastic applanator or a pneumotonometer and palpation of the eye by the surgeon. Surgeons without extensive experience are advised to use an objective rather than a subjective method.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Before the lamellar cut is made, the surface of the cornea is moistened with proparacaine with glycerin or with nonpreserved artificial tears. Use of balanced salt solution should be avoided at this point because mineral deposits may develop within the microkeratome and interfere with its proper function. The surgeon places the microkeratome on the suction ring (if it is a 2-piece system) and checks that its path is free of obstacles such as the eyelid speculum, drape, or overhanging eyelid. The microkeratome is then activated, passed over the cornea (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-5</span>) until it is halted by the hinge-&#173;creating stopper, and then reversed off the cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, the surgeon should be aware that, regardless of the label describing the flap thickness of a specific device, the actual flap thickness varies with the type of microkeratome, patient age, preoperative corneal thickness, preoperative keratometry reading, preoperative astigmatism, corneal diameter, and translation speed of the microkeratome pass. It is important to maintain a steady translation speed to avoid creating irregularities in the stromal bed.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h4-head">Femtosecond laser</span> The femtosecond laser can also be used to create a lamellar dissection within the stroma. Each laser pulse creates a discrete area of photodisruption of the collagen. The greater the number of laser spots and the more the spots overlap, the more easily the tissue will separate when lifted. The femtosecond laser allows adjustments for several variables involved in making the flap, including flap thickness, flap diameter, hinge location, hinge angle, bed energy, and spot separation. Although the goal is to try to minimize the total energy used in flap creation, a certain level of power is necessary to ensure complete photodisruption. With the computer programmed for flap diameter, depth, and hinge location and size, thousands of adjacent pulses are scanned across the cornea in a controlled pattern that results in creation of a flap. Some potential advantages of the femtosecond laser include excellent depth control, reduction of complications such as buttonhole perforations, precise control of flap dimensions and location, and the ability to create pockets and channels within the cornea. Utilization of the femtosecond laser allows the geometry of the side cut to be modified in a manner that may reduce the incidence of epithelial ingrowth and flap slippage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Femtosecond laser complications can occur, however. One study of 208&#160;eyes showed that 1.9% had a loss of suction during femtosecond laser flap creation but that all had successful flap creation after reapplanation of the eye. Occasionally, an opaque bubble layer (OBL) may form from gas expansion into in the stroma adjacent to the flap interface and lead to improper flap creation. To prevent an OBL, most lasers now create a pocket deep within the cornea to disperse the gas away from the flap interface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although some variation exists between femtosecond lasers, all systems require centration and vacuum adherence to the patient’s cornea. Complete applanation of the cornea must be achieved, or an incomplete flap or incomplete side cut may result. <span class="xref-figure">Figures&#160;5-6, 5-7, and 5-8</span> illustrate some components of the femtosecond laser. Video&#160;5-2 demonstrates the use of a femtosecond laser for flap creation and the subsequent treatment with the excimer laser.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once centration is confirmed on the laser, the surgeon administers the femtosecond laser treatment. The vacuum is then released, the suction ring is removed, and the patient is positioned under the excimer laser. A spatula with a semisharp edge is used to identify and score the flap edge near the hinge (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-9</span>). The instrument is then passed across the flap along the base of the hinge, and the flap is lifted by sweeping inferiorly and separating the flap interface, dissecting one-third of the flap at a time and thus reducing the risk of tearing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several studies have compared the benefits of the mechanical microkeratome with those of femtosecond lasers for creating flaps. Minimal differences between the techniques have been found for most patients (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;5-2</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2">Application of Laser Treatment</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Tracking, centration, and ablation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For surface ablation, the exposed Bowman layer should be inspected and found to be smooth, uniformly dry, and free of debris and residual epithelial islands. For LASIK, the flap must be lifted and reflected, and the stromal bed must be uniformly dry before treatment. Fluid or blood accumulation on the stromal bed should be avoided, as it can lead to an irregular ablation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Excimer lasers in current use employ open-&#173;loop tracking systems, which have improved clinical outcomes. The tracker uses video technology to monitor the location of an infrared image of the pupil and to shift the laser beam accordingly.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The laser is centered and focused according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Tracking systems, although effective, do not lessen the importance of keeping the reticule centered on the patient’s entrance pupil. If the patient is unable to maintain fixation, the illumination of the operating microscope should be reduced. If decentration occurs and the ablation does not stop automatically, the surgeon should immediately stop the treatment until adequate refixation is achieved. It is still important for the surgeon to monitor for excessive eye movement, which can result in decentration despite the tracking device.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The change in illumination and in patient position (ie, from sitting to lying down) can cause pupil centroid shift and cyclotorsion. In most patients, the pupil moves nasally and superiorly when it is constricted. <span class="italic">Registration</span> is a technique in which a fixed landmark is used at the time of aberrometry and treatment to apply the ablation to the correct area of the cornea; it relies on iris landmarks and not on the pupil for laser centration (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-10</span>). Once the patient confirms that the fixation light of the excimer laser is still visible and that he or she is looking directly at it, ablation begins. Neither tracking nor iris registration is a substitute for accurate patient fixation. It is important to initiate stromal ablation promptly, before excessive stromal dehydration takes place. During larger-&#173;diameter ablations, a flap protector may be needed to shield the underside of the LASIK flap near the hinge from the laser pulses. In addition, it is important to remove the excessive fluid that can accumulate during treatment, especially in patients undergoing high corrections.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Immediate Postablation Measures</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Surface ablation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">One of the major potential complications of surface ablation is corneal haze. To decrease the chance of post–surface ablation corneal haze, especially for eyes with previous corneal surgery such as PRK, LASIK, PKP, RK, or primary surface ablations for moderate to high treatments or deeper ablation depths, a pledget soaked in mitomycin&#160;C (usually 0.02% or 0.2&#160;mg/mL) can be placed on the ablated surface for approximately 12&#160;seconds to 2&#160;minutes at the end of the laser exposure. The concentration and duration of mitomycin&#160;C application varies by diagnosis and surgeon preference; however, most surgeons tend toward shorter durations of mitomycin&#160;C exposure. Application of mitomycin&#160;C for 12&#160;seconds appears to be as efficacious for prophylaxis as prolonged times. Some surgeons reduce the amount of treatment when applying mitomycin&#160;C in surface ablation due to reports of potential endothelial cell toxicity. The cornea is then copiously irrigated with balanced salt solution to remove excess mitomycin&#160;C. To avoid damage to limbal stem cells, care should be taken not to expose the limbus or conjunctiva to mitomycin&#160;C. Confocal microscopy studies of human eyes have shown a reduced keratocyte population and less haze in eyes that received mitomycin&#160;C.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some surgeons apply sterile, chilled, balanced salt solution or a frozen cellulose sponge before and/or after the surface ablation procedure in the belief that cooling reduces pain and haze formation. However, the advantage of this practice has not been substantiated in a controlled study. Care should be taken to not expose the eye to tap water, which may result in infectious contamination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the LASEK or epi-&#173;LASIK variant has been performed, the surgeon carefully floats and moves the epithelial sheet back into position with balanced salt solution. Antibiotic, corticosteroid, and, sometimes, nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are then placed on the eye, followed by a bandage contact lens. Some NSAIDs and antibiotics can be placed directly on the corneal bed, whereas others should be placed only on the surface of the contact lens, as they have been associated with poor corneal healing. If the patient cannot tolerate a bandage contact lens, a pressure patch may be used. Of note, the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery released a clinical alert on February&#160;14, 2013, discussing the postoperative risks posed by certain medications used topically prior to or during LASIK or PRK. The medications listed in this statement have the potential to cause flap slippage and/or diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK) following LASIK surgery and poor epithelial healing following PRK.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">LASIK</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After the ablation is completed, the flap is replaced onto the stromal bed. The interface is irrigated until all interface debris is eliminated (which is apparent more readily with oblique than with coaxial illumination). The surface of the flap is gently stroked using a smooth instrument, such as an irrigation cannula or a moistened microsurgical spear sponge, from the hinge, or center, to the periphery. This approach helps to ensure that wrinkles are eliminated and that the flap settles back into its original position, as indicated by realignment of the corneal marks made earlier. The peripheral gutters should be symmetric and even. The physiologic dehydration of the stroma by the endothelial pump will begin to secure the flap in position within several minutes. If a significant epithelial defect or a large, loose sheet of epithelium is present, a bandage contact lens should be put in place. Once the flap is adherent, the eyelid speculum is removed carefully so as not to disturb the flap. Most surgeons place varying combinations of antibiotic, NSAID, and corticosteroid drops on the eye at the conclusion of the procedure. The flap is usually rechecked at the slit lamp before the patient leaves to make sure it has remained in proper alignment. A clear shield or protective goggles are often placed to guard against accidental trauma that could displace the flap. Patients are instructed not to rub or squeeze their&#160;eyes.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Postoperative Care</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Surface ablation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After surface ablation, patients may experience variable degrees of pain, from minimal to severe, and some may need oral NSAID, narcotic, or neuropathic pain medications. Studies have shown that topical NSAID drops reduce postoperative pain, although they may also slow the rate of re-&#173;epithelialization and promote sterile infiltrates (see Chapter&#160;6). Corneal melting and stromal scarring have been described after the use of some topical NSAIDs. For patients who are not healing normally after surface ablation, use of any topical NSAID should be discontinued.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients should be monitored closely until the epithelium is completely healed, which usually occurs within 4–7&#160;days. As long as the bandage contact lens is in place, patients are treated with topical broad-&#173;spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids, usually 4&#160;times daily. Once the epithelium is healed, the bandage contact lens, antibiotic drops, and NSAID drops (if used) may be discontinued. In addition, most clinicians recommend avoidance of swimming and the use of hot tubs for at least 2&#160;weeks postoperatively to help lessen the risk of infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The use of topical corticosteroids to modulate postoperative wound healing, reduce anterior stromal haze, and decrease regression of the refractive effect remains controversial. Although some studies have demonstrated that corticosteroids have no significant long-term effect on corneal haze or visual outcome after PRK, other studies have shown that corticosteroids are effective in limiting haze and myopic regression after PRK, particularly after higher myopic corrections. Some surgeons who advocate use of topical corticosteroids after the removal of the bandage contact lens restrict their use to patients with higher levels of myopia (eg, myopia greater than –4.00 or –5.00&#160;D). When used after removal of the bandage contact lens, corticosteroid drops are typically tapered over a 1- to 4-month period, depending on the patient’s corneal haze and refractive outcome. Patients who received mitomycin&#160;C at the time of surgery have a reduced risk of haze formation and thus may have a shorter duration of corticosteroid use. Patients who had PRK for hyperopia may experience prolonged epithelial healing because of the larger epithelial defect resulting from the larger ablation zone, as well as a temporary reduction in best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA; also called <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity, CDVA</span>) in the first week to month, which usually improves with time. Many patients with hyperopia also experience a temporary myopic overcorrection, which regresses over several weeks to months. In the absence of complications, routine follow-&#173;up examinations are typically scheduled at approximately 2–4&#160;weeks, 2–3&#160;months, 6&#160;months, and 12&#160;months postoperatively and perhaps more frequently, depending on the steroid taper used.</p>
			<p class="h3">LASIK</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many surgeons instruct their patients to use topical antibiotics and corticosteroids postoperatively for 3–7&#160;days. With femtosecond laser procedures, some surgeons prescribe more frequent applications of corticosteroid eye drops or a longer period of use due to a tendency of older femtosecond lasers to create more intrastromal inflammation. LASIK flaps made with current generation femtosecond lasers have similar inflammation profiles to microkeratome cut flaps. In addition, it is very important for the surface of the flap to be kept well lubricated in the early postoperative period. Patients may be told to use the protective shield for 1–7&#160;days when they shower or sleep and to avoid swimming and the use of hot tubs for 2&#160;weeks. Patients are examined 1&#160;day after surgery to ensure that the flap has remained in proper alignment and that there is no evidence of infection or excessive inflammation. In the absence of complications, the next examinations are typically scheduled at approximately 1&#160;week, 1&#160;month, 3&#160;months, 6&#160;months, and 12&#160;months postoperatively.</p>

		   <div id="Chapt5_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As the early broad-beam excimer laser systems improved and surgeons gained experience, the results achieved with surface ablation and LASIK improved markedly. The ablation zone diameter was enlarged because it was found that small ablation zones, originally selected to limit depth of tissue removal, produced more haze and regression in surface ablation treatments and concerns about subjective glare and halos for both surface ablation and LASIK. The larger treatment diameters currently used, including for optical zones and gradual aspheric peripheral blend zones, improve optical quality and refractive stability in both myopic and hyperopic treatments. Central island elevations have become less common with improvements in beam quality, vacuums to remove the ablation plume, and the development of scanning and variable-&#173;spot-size excimer lasers.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Outcomes for Hyperopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In myopic ablations, the central cornea is flattened, whereas in hyperopic ablations, more tissue is removed from the midperiphery than from the central cornea, resulting in an effective steepening (see Fig&#160;5-1B). To ensure that the size of the central hyperopic treatment zone is adequate, a large ablation area is required for hyperopic treatments. Most studies have employed hyperopic treatment zones with transition zones out to 9.0–9.5&#160;mm. FDA clinical trials of PRK and LASIK for hyperopia up to +6.00&#160;D reported that 46%–59% of eyes had postoperative UCVA of 20/20 or better, 92%–96% had UCVA of 20/40 or better, and 84%–91% were within 1.00&#160;D of emmetropia; loss of more than 2&#160;lines of BCVA occurred in 1%–3.5%. The VISX FDA clinical trial of hyperopic astigmatic PRK up to +6.00&#160;D sphere and +4.00&#160;D cylinder reported an approximate postoperative UCVA of 20/20 or better in 50% of eyes, UCVA of 20/40 or better in 97%, and 87% within ±1.00&#160;D of emmetropia, with loss of more than 2&#160;lines of BCVA in 1.5%. For the same amount of correction, the period from surgery to postoperative stabilization is longer for hyperopic than for myopic corrections. Overall, studies with larger ablation zones have demonstrated good results for refractive errors up to +4.00&#160;D for conventional treatments, but predictability and stability are markedly reduced with LASIK treatments for hyperopia above this level. Consequently, most refractive surgeons do not treat up to the highest levels of hyperopia that have been approved by the FDA for conventional treatments.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Wavefront-&#173;guided or wavefront-&#173;optimized LASIK coupled with sophisticated eye-&#173;tracking systems has greatly improved the accuracy and reproducibility of results, allowing even higher percentages of patients to obtain UCVA of 20/20 and 20/40. In wavefront-&#173;guided LASIK for myopic astigmatism, for example, up to about –10.00 to –12.00&#160;D, 79%–95% of patients obtained 20/20 UCVA, and 96%–100% obtained 20/40 UCVA. In wavefront-&#173;guided LASIK for hyperopic astigmatism up to +6.00&#160;D, 55%–59% of patients obtained 20/20 UCVA, and 93%–97% obtained 20/40 UCVA. In wavefront-&#173;guided LASIK for mixed astigmatism with up to +5.00&#160;D of cylinder, 56%–61% of patients obtained 20/20 UCVA, and 95% obtained 20/40 UCVA.

			<p class="h1">Re-treatment (Enhancements)</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although excimer laser ablation reduces refractive error and improves UCVA in almost all cases, some patients have residual refractive errors and would benefit from re-&#173;treatment. The degree of refractive error that warrants re-&#173;treatment varies depending on the patient’s lifestyle and expectations. Re-&#173;treatment rates also vary, depending on the degree of refractive error being treated, the laser and nomograms used, and the expectations of the patient. One advantage of LASIK over surface ablation is that refractive stability generally occurs earlier, allowing earlier enhancements, typically within the first 3&#160;months after LASIK. With surface ablation, the ongoing activation of keratocytes and the risk of haze after enhancement usually require a wait of 3–6&#160;months before an enhancement surface ablation is undertaken. Typically, re-&#173;treatment rates are higher for hyperopia and for high astigmatism than for other indications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Studies showed that rates of re-&#173;treatment are higher for higher initial correction, residual astigmatism, and patients older than 40&#160;years. One should be careful when enhancing a myopic shift in a patient older than 50&#160;years, as this may be due to a lens-&#173;induced myopic shift rather than post–refractive surgery regression. Re-&#173;treatment rates vary from 1% to 11%, based on surgeon experience, patient demands, and the other factors just described. Surface ablation re-&#173;treatment is nearly identical to primary surface ablation treatment, whereas LASIK re-&#173;treatment can be performed either by lifting the preexisting lamellar flap and applying additional ablation to the stromal bed or by performing surface ablation on the LASIK flap. In most cases, the flap can be lifted many years after the original procedure. However, because of the safety of surface ablation after LASIK and the increased risk of epithelial ingrowth with flap lifts, many surgeons now prefer to perform surface ablation re-&#173;treatment if the primary LASIK was performed more than 2–3&#160;years earlier. Creating a new flap with a mechanical microkeratome should be avoided because free slivers of tissue, irregular stromal beds, and irregular astigmatism may be produced. Using the femtosecond laser to create a new side cut within the boundaries of the previous flap may facilitate flap-lift enhancements; however, it is important to have an adequate exposed diameter for ablation, and tissues slivers can result if the old and new side cuts overlap. When attempting to lift or manipulate a femtosecond laser–created flap, the surgeon must take care to avoid tearing it, because the femtosecond laser usually creates a thinner flap than traditional microkeratomes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When a preexisting flap is lifted, it is important to minimize epithelial disruption. A jeweler’s forceps, Sinskey hook, or 27-gauge needle can be used to localize the edge of the previous flap. Because the edge of the flap can be seen more easily with the slit lamp than with the diffuse illumination of the operating microscope of the laser, some surgeons find it easier to begin a flap lift at the slit lamp and complete it at the excimer laser. Alternatively, the surgeon can often visualize the edge of the flap under the diffuse illumination of the operating microscope by applying pressure with a small Sinskey hook or similar device; the edge of the flap will dimple and disrupt the light reflex (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-11</span>). A careful circumferential epithelial dissection is performed so that the flap can then be lifted without tearing the epithelial edges. Smooth forceps, iris spatulas, and several instruments specifically designed for dissecting the flap edge can be used to lift the original flap.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once the ablation has been performed, the flap is repositioned and the interface is irrigated, as in the initial LASIK procedure. Special care must be taken to ensure that no loose epithelium is trapped beneath the edge of the flap that could lead to epithelial ingrowth; the risk of epithelial ingrowth is greater after re-&#173;treatment than after primary treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surface ablation may be considered to enhance a previous primary LASIK treatment. Surface ablation performed on a LASIK flap carries an increased risk of haze formation and irregular astigmatism, but it is an appealing alternative when the RSB is insufficient for further ablation; when the LASIK was performed by another surgeon and the flap thickness, or RSB, is not known; or with conditions such as a buttonhole or incomplete flap. Care must be taken when removing the epithelium over a flap to avoid inadvertently lifting or dislocating the flap. Applying 20% ethanol for 20–30&#160;seconds inside a corneal well will loosen the epithelium, after which scraping motions are applied that extend from the hinge toward the periphery. A rotating brush should not be used to remove the epithelium from a LASIK flap. The risk of postoperative haze due to surface ablation over a previous LASIK flap may be avoided or reduced by administering intraoperative topical mitomycin&#160;C, 0.02%, and postoperative topical corticosteroids.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The appropriate choice between conventional and wavefront-&#173;guided treatment for enhancing the vision of patients who have previously undergone conventional LASIK is not yet established. Some studies report better results in both safety and efficacy with conventional LASIK re-&#173;treatment. With wavefront-&#173;guided re-&#173;treatments, particularly in patients with high spherical aberrations, the risk of overcorrection may be greater. Caution should be exercised in evaluating the degree of higher-&#173;order aberrations and the planned depth of the ablation when deciding between conventional and wavefront-&#173;guided treatments.</p>
