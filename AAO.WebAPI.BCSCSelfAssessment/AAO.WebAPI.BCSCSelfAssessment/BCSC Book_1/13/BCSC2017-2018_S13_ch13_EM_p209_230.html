			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">c. </span><span class="CharOverride-11">A Placido disk–based topographer captures and analyzes an image of a series of concentric rings reflected off the corneal surface. The computer measures the distance from the edge of each ring to the next ring along multiple semi-meridians and generates a map of the corneal surface that would be required to produce the captured image. These data are frequently expressed in color maps. The system can present the color maps in several ways, including axial curvature, tangential curvature, best-fit sphere, and an image of the rings themselves as seen by the computer.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;2.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">d. </span><span class="CharOverride-11">Placido disk topography uses the image of a series of concentric rings reflected from the </span><span class="CharOverride-11">corneal surface, and the resulting information depends on several variables. One of the </span><span class="CharOverride-11">most important is the quality of the air/tear film interface, the interface that gives rise <br />to </span><span class="CharOverride-11">most of the eye’s focusing power. If the tear film is irregular or the eye is dry, the Placido imaging device can generate abnormal reflections that result in unreliable data about corneal curvature. In addition, if the topographer is misaligned to the optical axis, the data is less than optimal. Peripheral corneal findings or refractive error due to latent hyperopia would not be expected to affect central corneal topography measurements.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;3.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">c. </span><span class="CharOverride-11">The amount of tissue removed centrally for myopic treatments using a broad beam laser is estimated by the Munnerlyn formula: Ablation Depth (µm) ≈ Degree of Myopia (D) </span><span class="CharOverride-12">× </span><span class="CharOverride-11">(Optical Zone diameter)</span><span class="CharOverride-13">2</span><span class="CharOverride-11"> (mm)/3. This formula shows that for a specific degree of myopia, ablation depth increases by the square of the treated optical zone. The effective change is independent of the initial corneal curvature. The density of the cornea may change the amount of tissue ablated per unit of laser energy, but it will not change the depth of ablation required to correct a specific degree of myopia. Because excimer laser irradiation is absorbed by hydrocarbons, increasing humidity in the laser suite may require increasing power delivered to the cornea to get the same effect at the corneal surface; however, this will not affect the depth of the laser ablation required to treat a specific degree of myopia.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;4.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">a. </span><span class="CharOverride-11">Leaving a residual stromal bed of less than 250 µm may place the patient at higher risk of developing corneal ectasia after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;5.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">a. </span><span class="CharOverride-11">Pregnancy and breastfeeding can cause a temporary change in refraction, which makes refractive surgery potentially less accurate. Many surgeons recommend waiting at least 3&#160;months after delivery and cessation of breastfeeding before performing the refractive surgery evaluation and procedure.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;6.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-11">Younger patients may be accommodating during the dry refraction, thereby resulting in an overminused refraction. In a myopic eye, using an inaccurate dry refraction would result in overcorrection; in a hyperopic eye, an overminused refraction would result in an undercorrection. By performing a wet, or cycloplegic, refraction, the true refractive error </span><span class="CharOverride-11">can be unmasked. Many surgeons perform manifest and cycloplegic refractions close to</span><span class="CharOverride-11">gether. If they are not performed close together, a post-cycloplegic dry refraction should be performed later to obtain the correct refraction for use in refractive surgery.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;7.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-11">Contact lens wear may result in corneal warpage. Many surgeons recommend that patients discontinue use of soft contact lenses for 3&#160;days to 2&#160;weeks, soft toric contact lenses for 2&#160;weeks or longer, and rigid contact lenses for 2–3&#160;weeks before the refractive surgery evaluation. This allows the cornea to resume its normal, baseline characteristics, which can then use used to plan refractive surgery. In some long-term hard contact lens wearers, the cornea may require months to return to a stable curvature, and sequential corneal mapping is recommended to document stability.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;8.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">a. </span><span class="CharOverride-11">For an arcuate keratotomy procedure, cylindrical correction can be increased by increasing the length or depth of the incision, using multiple incisions or reducing the optical zone. </span></p>

The Prospective Evaluation of Radial Keratotomy (PERK) study found that 43% of eyes undergoing RK developed progressive hyperopia and were overcorrected by more than 1.00 diopters at 10&#160;years postoperatively. Loss of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA; also called </span><span class="CharOverride-1">corrected distance visual acuity</span><span class="CharOverride-11">, CDVA) secondary to nuclear sclerotic cataract can occur after RK surgery; however, this usually occurs secondary to aging and is not related to the procedure itself. Increased intraocular pressure is a rare complication that can occur secondary to treatment with topical corticosteroids in the early postoperative period.

These inlays have several potential advantages over homoplastic inlays, such as the ability to be accurately mass-produced in a wide range of sizes and powers. Four different presbyopic inlays have been developed and are currently in investigational studies. In 2015, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the small-aperture KAMRA corneal inlay (AcuFocus Inc, Irvine, CA) for the improvement of near vision in presbyopic patients who require near correction.</span></p>

Minimal differences between the techniques have been found for most patients.

Because of their asymmetry, these marks can aid in alignment of the flap at the end of surgery and in proper orientation in the rare event of a free flap. It is helpful to avoid heavy ink marks that might cause epithelial toxicity. Topical anesthetics should be applied immediately before the procedure, as excess anesthetic may cause the epithelium to slough. It is important to cover the eye not being treated to prevent cross-fixation by the patient on the laser fixation target.</span></p>

Topical NSAIDs may be used sparingly, but they can have an anesthetic effect and may inhibit healing. If the reepithelialization of the cornea appears to be impaired, then any agent that may impair healing should be stopped to reduce the risk of haze.

Specular microscopy is also routinely performed for patients before PIOL implantation. All currently FDA-approved PIOLs suggest the preoperative measurement of endothelial cell counts and are contraindicated in patients with inadequate preexisting endothelial health. All PIOLs are associated with some degree of endothelial cell loss during the implantation procedure. Ongoing assessment of anterior chamber depth and endothelial cell health is typically performed after PIOL implantation.</span></p>

Some patients may prefer their nondominant eye for distance, and others prefer their dominant eye. Many patients do not tolerate adequate anisometropia to allow for adequate near vision, and therefore would typically not undergo refractive surgery.</span></p>

Decentration of the IOL, unless significant and obvious, should not be addressed as the first-line treatment, as the intervention is invasive and may be avoidable. Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy should be considered only if other causes have been ruled out, as the opening of the capsule will then cause a significant challenge if IOL exchange becomes necessary.</span></p>

			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;27.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">c. </span><span class="CharOverride-11">To create monovision in a myopic patient, it is necessary to undercorrect 1 eye (usually the nondominant eye). The amount of desired undercorrection is determined by a combination of the patient’s requirements for near vision and the amount of anisometropia that is tolerable. In a 45-year-old patient, 1.50 D is generally the appropriate amount of undercorrection for providing functional near vision without generating significant problems with anisometropia, if the nondominant eye requires correction with glasses for activities such as driving at night. This refraction allows good uncorrected distance vision in the dominant eye and good near vision in the nondominant eye. If a postoperative refraction of –1.50 D is desired in a patient who has a preoperative refraction of –5.0 D, then a correction of –3.50 D needs to be programmed into the laser. All patients being evaluated for a surgical monovision correction should initially try monovision contact lenses to ensure they can tolerate the anisometropia and visual quality of monovision and to confirm the preferred distance and near eye.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;28.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">d. </span><span class="CharOverride-11">Dry-eye symptoms are the most common adverse effects of refractive surgery, and occasionally may persist for months or years; they have been reported in 60%–70% of all patients, to varying degrees. Corneal sensitivity decreases after LASIK because of the surgical amputation of nerves during flap formation and the destruction of superficial nerve fibers during the laser ablation. This may result in corneal anesthesia lasting 3–6&#160;months. As a result, most patients experience a decrease in tear production. Patients who had dry eyes before surgery or whose eyes were marginally compensated before surgery more have more severe symptoms. In addition, patients with dry eyes following LASIK or surface ablation have an abnormal tear film and a poor ocular surface, and they will often note fluctuating vision between blinks and at different times of the day.</span></p>

In certain cases, connective tissue and autoimmune disease are relative contraindications to refractive surgery, because these conditions can adversely affect healing. However, good results can be achieved in some patients with stable, inactive, well-controlled connective tissue and autoimmune diseases. A LASIK procedure in such patients may be considered “off-label.” The potential increased risk and possible “off-label” status should be discussed with the patient and documented in the medical record. </span></p>

Surgery in such patients may be considered “off-label.” The potential increased risk and possible “off-label” status should be discussed with the patient and documented in the medical record. Keratometry readings lower than approximately 34.00 D and higher than approximately 50.00 D increase the risk of poor-quality vision after refractive surgery. A patient with low myopia who has a preoperative keratometry reading of 39.00 D would probably have a postoperative keratometry reading above 34.00 D. A hyperopic patient with a preoperative keratometry reading of 46.00 D would very likely have a postoperative keratometry reading below 50.00 D.

In patients with a history of strabismus, especially esotropia, reducing or eliminating the hyperopia should reduce accommodative convergence and decrease the tendency for esotropia. Prism correction may still be necessary following PRK in patients with strabismus. PRK will usually not significantly improve dense amblyopia. Persistent diplopia has been reported after bilateral LASIK in a patient with anisometropic amblyopia and a history of intermittent diplopia in childhood. Preoperatively, this type of patient can adjust to the disparity of the retinal image sizes with spectacle correction. Refractive surgery, however, can result in a dissimilar retinal image size that the patient cannot fuse, resulting in diplopia. Strabismus surgery may not always be indicated or possible after PRK surgery, despite the persistence or worsening of diplopia. Patients need to be warned about this possible postoperative complication. </span></p>

It is important to diagnose forme fruste keratoconus during the screening examination </span><span class="CharOverride-11">for refractive surgery. Although keratoconus can be diagnosed by slit-lamp examination </span><span class="CharOverride-11">and manual keratometry, more sensitive analyses using corneal topography and corneal pachymetry can reveal findings consistent with early keratoconus. No specific agreed-upon test or measurement is diagnostic of a corneal ectatic disorder, but both of these diagnostic tests should be part of the evaluation, because subtle corneal thinning or curvature changes can be overlooked on slit-lamp evaluation. The existing literature on ectasia and longitudinal studies of the fellow eye of unilateral keratoconus patients indicate that asymmetric inferior corneal steepening or asymmetric bow-tie topographic patterns with skewed steep radial axes above and below the horizontal meridian are risk factors for progression to keratoconus and post-LASIK ectasia.
