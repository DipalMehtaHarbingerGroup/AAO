			<p class="chapter-title">Introduction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Of all the subspecialties within ophthalmology, refractive surgery may be the most rapidly evolving. However, the language associated with the recording of visual acuity is also changing. For this edition, the BCSC Section&#160;13 Committee uses the following conventions with respect to the recording of corrected and uncorrected visual acuity. Where the Section used the term <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA)</span> in the previous edition, it now uses <span class="italic">best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA),</span> followed by the newer term on first mention within a chapter. Similarly, <span class="italic">uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA)</span> will be replaced by <span class="italic">uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA).</span> A visual acuity conversion chart is available on the inside front cover.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Refractive surgeons, as in all medical specialties, also use numerous abbreviations and acronyms in discussing and describing their field, especially for the continually emerging and changing refractive procedures.

			<p class="chapter-number"><span class="cn-chap">Chapter </span>1</p>
			<p class="chapter-title">The Science of Refractive Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goal of refractive surgery is to reduce dependence on contact lenses or glasses for use in routine daily activities. A wide variety of surgical techniques and technologies are available, and all require an appropriate presurgical evaluation to determine the best technique and ensure the optimal outcome for each patient individually.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Refractive surgical procedures can be categorized broadly as <span class="italic">corneal</span> or <span class="italic">intraocular</span> (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;1-1</span>). Keratorefractive (corneal) procedures include incisional, laser ablation, lamellar implantation, corneal collagen shrinkage, and corneal crosslinking techniques. Intraocular refractive procedures include phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) implantation and cataract surgery or refractive lens exchange (RLE) with implantation of a monofocal, toric, multifocal, or accommodative intraocular lens. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages and should be specifically matched to the individual patient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This chapter reviews the fundamental corneal properties relevant to refractive surgery (focusing on keratorefractive procedures), corneal imaging for refractive surgery, and the effects of keratorefractive surgery on the cornea. It includes review of the optical principles discussed in BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics;</span> refractive errors (both lower- and higher-&#173;order aberrations); corneal biomechanics; corneal topography and tomography; wavefront analysis; laser biophysics and laser–tissue interactions; corneal biomechanical changes after surgery; and corneal wound healing.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Corneal Optics</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The air–tear-film interface provides the majority of the optical power of the eye. Although a normal tear film has minimal deleterious effect, an abnormal tear film can have a dramatic impact on vision. For example, either excess tear film (eg, epiphora) or altered tear film (eg, dry eye or blepharitis) can decrease visual quality.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The optical power of the eye derives primarily from the anterior corneal curvature, which produces about two-thirds of the eye’s refractive power, approximately +48.00&#160;diopters&#160;(D). The overall corneal power is less (approximately +42.00&#160;D) as a result of the negative power (approximately –6.00&#160;D) of the posterior corneal surface. Standard keratometers and Placido-&#173;based (ie, based on an analysis of corneal reflections of a concentric ring image) corneal topography instruments measure the anterior corneal radius of curvature and <span class="italic">estimate</span> total corneal power from these front-&#173;surface measurements. These instruments extrapolate the central corneal power <span class="italic">(K)</span> by measuring the rate of change in curvature from the paracentral 3–4-mm zone; this factor takes on crucial importance in the determination of IOL power after keratorefractive surgery (see Chapter&#160;11). The normal cornea flattens from the center to the periphery by up to 4.00&#160;D (this progressive flattening toward the peripheral cornea is referred to as a <span class="italic">prolate</span> shape) and is flatter nasally than temporally.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The majority of keratorefractive surgical procedures change the refractive state of the eye by altering corneal curvature. The tolerances involved in altering corneal dimensions are relatively small. For instance, changing the refractive status of the eye by 2.00&#160;D may require altering the cornea’s thickness by less than 30&#160;µm. Thus, achieving predictable results is sometimes problematic because minuscule changes in the shape of the cornea may produce large changes in refraction.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Refractive Error: Optical Principles and Wavefront Analysis</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">One of the major applications of the wave theory of light is in wavefront analysis (see also BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics,</span> Chapter&#160;6). Currently, wavefront analysis can be performed clinically by 4&#160;methods: Hartmann-&#173;Shack, Tscherning, thin-beam single-&#173;ray tracing, and optical path difference. Each method generates a detailed report of lower-&#173;order aberrations (sphere and cylinder) and higher-&#173;order aberrations (spherical aberration, coma, and trefoil, among others). This information is useful both in calculating custom ablations to enhance vision or correct optical problems and in explaining patients’ visual symptoms.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Measurement of Wavefront Aberrations and Graphical Representations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although several techniques are available for measuring wavefront aberrations, the most popular in clinical practice is based on the Hartmann-&#173;Shack wavefront sensor. With this device, a low-&#173;power laser beam is focused on the retina. A point on the retina acts as a point source, and the reflected light is then propagated back (anteriorly) through the optical elements of the eye to a detector. In an aberration-&#173;free eye, all the rays would emerge in parallel, and the reflected wavefront would be a flat plane. In reality, the wavefront is not flat. To determine the shape of the reflected wavefront, an array of lenses samples parts of the wavefront and focuses light on a detector (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-1A</span>). The extent of the divergence of the lenslet images from their expected focal points determines the wavefront error (Fig&#160;1-1B). Optical aberrations measured by the aberrometer can be resolved into a variety of basic <span class="italic">shapes,</span> the combination of which represents the total aberration of the patient’s ocular system, just as conventional refractive error is a combination of sphere and cylinder.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Currently, wavefront aberrations are most commonly specified by <span class="italic">Zernike polynomials,</span> which are the mathematical formulas used to describe the surfaces shown in <span class="xref-figure">Figures&#160;1-2 through 1-6</span>. Each aberration may be positive or negative in value and induces predictable alterations in the image quality. The magnitude of these aberrations is expressed as a root mean square (RMS) error, which is the deviation of the wavefront averaged over the entire wavefront. The higher the RMS value is, the greater is the overall aberration for a given eye. The majority of patients have total RMS values less than 0.3&#160;µm. Most higher-&#173;order Zernike coefficients have mean values close to zero. The most important Zernike coefficients affecting visual quality are coma, spherical aberration, and trefoil.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Fourier analysis</span> is an alternative method of evaluating the output from an aberrometer. Fourier analysis involves a sine wave–derived transformation of a complex shape. Compared with shapes derived from Zernike polynomial analysis, the shapes derived from Fourier analysis are more detailed, theoretically allowing for the measurement and treatment of more highly aberrant corneas.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Lower-Order Aberrations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Myopia, hyperopia, and regular astigmatism are all lower-&#173;order (second-&#173;order) aberrations that can be expressed as wavefront aberrations. Myopia produces <span class="italic">positive defocus</span> (Fig&#160;1-2), whereas hyperopia produces <span class="italic">negative defocus.</span> Regular (cylindrical) astigmatism produces a wavefront aberration that has orthogonal (ie, facing at right angles) and oblique components (Fig&#160;1-3). Other lower-&#173;order aberrations are non–visually significant aberrations known as <span class="italic">first-&#173;order aberrations,</span> such as vertical and horizontal prisms and zero-&#173;order aberrations (piston).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Higher-Order Aberrations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Wavefront aberration is highly dependent on pupil size, with increased higher-&#173;order aberrations apparent as the pupil dilates. Higher-&#173;order aberrations also increase with age, although the clinical effect is thought to be balanced by the increasing miosis of the pupil with age. Although lower-&#173;order aberrations decrease after laser vision correction, higher-&#173;order aberrations, particularly spherical aberration and coma, may increase after conventional surface ablation, laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), or radial keratotomy (RK) for myopia. This increase is correlated with the degree of preoperative myopia. After standard hyperopic laser vision correction, higher-&#173;order aberrations increase even more than they do in myopic eyes but in the opposite (toward negative values) direction. Compared with conventional treatments, customized excimer laser treatments may decrease the number of induced higher-&#173;order aberrations and provide a higher quality of vision, particularly in mesopic conditions.</p>
			<p class="h3">Spherical aberration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When peripheral light rays impacting a lens or the cornea focus in front of more central rays, the effect is called spherical aberration (Fig&#160;1-4). Clinically, this radially symmetric fourth-&#173;order aberration is the cause of night myopia and is commonly increased after RK and myopic LASIK and surface ablation. It results in halos around point images. Spherical aberration is the most significant higher-&#173;order aberration. It may increase depth of field but decreases contrast sensitivity.</p>
			<p class="h3">Coma and trefoil</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With coma, a third-&#173;order aberration, rays at one edge of the pupil come into focus before rays at the opposite edge do (Fig&#160;1-5). As can be seen by examining the illustrations, light rays entering the system do not focus on a plane; rather, one edge of the incoming beam focuses either in front of or behind the opposite edge of the beam. If one were to examine the image generated by an incoming light beam passing through an optical system with a coma aberration, the image would appear “smeared,” looking somewhat like a comet with a zone of sharp focus at one edge of the image tailing off to a fuzzy focus at the opposite edge of the beam. Coma is common in patients with decentered corneal grafts, keratoconus, and decentered laser ablations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Trefoil, also a third-&#173;order aberration, can occur after refractive surgery. Trefoil produces less degradation in image quality than does coma of similar RMS magnitude (Fig&#160;1-6).</p>
			<p class="h3">Other higher-order aberrations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">There are numerous other higher-&#173;order aberrations, of which only a small number are of clinical interest. As knowledge of surgically induced aberration increases, more of the basic types of aberrations may become clinically relevant.</p>
			<p class="h3">Effect of excimer laser ablation on higher-&#173;order aberrations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Whereas use of conventional (non–wavefront-&#173;guided) excimer laser ablations typically increases higher-&#173;order aberrations, both wavefront-&#173;optimized and wavefront-&#173;guided ablations tend to induce fewer higher-&#173;order aberrations and may, in principle, be able to reduce preexisting higher-&#173;order optical aberrations.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Corneal Biomechanics</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cornea consists of collagen fibrils arranged in approximately 200&#160;parallel lamellae that extend from limbus to limbus. The fibrils are oriented at angles to the fibrils in adjacent lamellae. This network of collagen is responsible for the mechanical strength of the cornea. The fibrils are more closely packed in the anterior two-thirds of the cornea and in the axial, or prepupillary, cornea than they are in the peripheral cornea (see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Structural differences between the anterior and posterior stroma affect the biomechanical behavior of the cornea. These include differences in glycosaminoglycans as well as more lamellar interweaving in the anterior corneal stroma; thus, the anterior cornea swells far less than the posterior cornea does. Stress within the tissue is partly related to intraocular pressure (IOP) but not in a linear manner under physiologic conditions (normal IOP range).When the cornea is in a dehydrated state, stress is distributed principally to the posterior layers or uniformly over the entire cornea. When the cornea is edematous, the anterior lamellae take up most of the strain. Most keratorefractive procedures alter corneal biomechanical properties either directly (eg, RK weakening the cornea to induce refractive change) or indirectly (eg, excimer laser surgery weakening the cornea by means of tissue removal). The lack of uniformity of biomechanical load throughout the cornea explains the variation in corneal biomechanical response to different keratorefractive procedures. For instance, LASIK has a greater overall effect than does photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) on corneal biomechanics, not only because a lamellar flap is created but also because the laser ablation occurs in the deeper, weaker corneal stroma (a more detailed discussion can be found later in this chapter and in Chapter&#160;5).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Corneal Imaging for Keratorefractive Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal shape, curvature, and thickness profiles can be generated from a variety of technologies such as Placido disk–based systems and elevation-&#173;based systems (including scanning-&#173;slit systems and Scheimpflug imaging). Each technology conveys different information about corneal curvature, anatomy, and biomechanical function. In addition, computerized topographic and tomographic systems may display other data: pupil size and location, indices estimating regular and irregular astigmatism, estimates of the probability of having keratoconus, simulated keratometry, and corneal asphericity. Other topography systems may integrate wavefront aberrometry data with topographic data. Although this additional information can be useful in preoperative surgical evaluations, no automated screening system can supplant clinical experience in evaluating corneal imaging.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The degree of asphericity of the cornea can be quantified by determining the <span class="italic">Q</span>&#160;value, with <span class="italic">Q</span>&#160;= 0 for spherical corneas, <span class="italic">Q</span>&#160;&lt;0 for prolate corneas (relatively flatter periphery), and <span class="italic">Q</span>&#160;&gt;0 for oblate corneas (relatively steeper periphery). A normal cornea is prolate, with an asphericity <span class="italic">Q</span>&#160;value of –0.26. Prolate corneas minimize spherical aberrations by virtue of their relatively flat peripheral curve. Conversely, oblate corneal contours, in which the peripheral cornea is steeper than the center, increase the probability of having induced spherical aberrations. After conventional refractive surgery for myopia, with the resulting flattening of the corneal center, corneal asphericity increases in the oblate direction, which may cause degradation of the optics of the eye.</p>
			<p class="h2">Corneal Topography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal topography provides highly detailed information about corneal curvature. Topography is evaluated using keratoscopic images, which are captured from Placido disk patterns that are reflected from the tear film overlying the corneal surface and then converted to computerized color scales (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-7</span>). Because the image is generated from the anterior surface of the tear film, irregularities in tear composition or volume can have a major impact on the quality and results of a Placido disk–based system. Because of this effect, reviewing the Placido image (image of the mires) prior to interpreting the maps and subsequent numerical data is extremely important. In addition, Placido disk–based systems are referenced from the line that the instrument makes to the corneal surface (termed the <span class="italic">vertex normal</span>). This line may not necessarily be the patient’s line of sight or the visual axis, which may lead to confusion in interpreting topographic maps. For a more extensive discussion of other uses of computerized corneal topography, refer to BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics,</span> and Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span> Generally, data from the reflection of the mires generated by the topographic instruments are presented not only numerically but—more important for clinical evaluation—also as an image, with corneal curvature typically represented utilizing axial and tangential methods.</p>
			<p class="h3">Axial power and curvature</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Axial power representation derives from the supposition that the cornea is a sphere and that the angle of incidence of the instrument is normal to the cornea. Axial power is based on the concept of “axial distance” (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-8</span>). As can be seen from the illustration, axial power underestimates steeper curvatures and overestimates flatter curvatures. This representation also is extremely dependent on the reference axis employed—optical or visual. Maps generated from the same cornea but using different reference axes look very different from one another. Axial power representations actually average the corneal powers and thereby provide a “smoother” representation of corneal curvature than does the tangential, or “instantaneous,” method. Recall that the curvature and power of the central 1–2&#160;mm of the cornea are generally not well imaged by Placido disk techniques but can be closely approximated by the axial power and curvature indices (formerly called <span class="italic">sagittal curvature</span>); however, the central measurements are extrapolated and thus are potentially inaccurate. These indices also fail to describe the true shape and power of the peripheral cornea. Topographic maps displaying axial power and curvature provide an intuitive sense of the physiologic flattening of the cornea but do not represent the true refractive power or the true curvature of peripheral regions of the cornea (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-9</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Instantaneous power and curvature</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A second method of describing the corneal curvature on Placido disk–based topography is the <span class="italic">instantaneous radius of curvature</span> (also called <span class="italic">meridional</span> or <span class="italic">tangential power</span>). The instantaneous radius of curvature is determined by taking a perpendicular path through the point in question from a plane that intersects the point and the visual axis, while allowing the radius to be the length necessary to correspond to a sphere with the same curvature at that point. The curvature, which is expressed in diopters, is estimated by the difference between the corneal index of refraction and 1.000, divided by this tangentially determined radius. A tangential map typically shows better sensitivity to peripheral changes with less “smoothing” of the curvature than an axial map shows (Fig&#160;1-9). In these maps, diopters are relative units of curvature and are not the equivalent of diopters of corneal power. The potential benefit of this method’s increased sensitivity is balanced by its tendency to document excessive detail (“noise”), which may not be clinically relevant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For routine refractive screening, most surgeons have the topographic output in the axial (sagittal) curvature mode rather than the instantaneous (tangential) mode.</p>
			<p class="h3">Corneal topography and astigmatism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A normal topographic image of a cornea without astigmatism demonstrates a relatively uniform color pattern centrally with a natural flattening in the periphery (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-10</span>). <span class="italic">Regular astigmatism</span> is uniform steepening along a single corneal meridian that can be fully corrected with a cylindrical lens. Topographic imaging of regular astigmatism demonstrates a symmetric “bow-tie” pattern along a single meridian with a straight axis on both sides of center (see Fig&#160;1-10B). The bow-tie pattern on topographic maps is an artifact of Placido-&#173;based imaging; that is, because the Placido image cannot detect curvature at the central measurement point, the corneal meridional steepening seems to disappear centrally and become enhanced as the imaging moves farther from center.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Irregular astigmatism</span> is nonuniform corneal steepening from a variety of causes that cannot be corrected by cylindrical lenses. Irregular astigmatism decreases best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA; also called <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity, CDVA</span>) and may reduce contrast sensitivity and increase visual aberrations, depending on the magnitude of irregularity. Rigid gas-&#173;permeable and hard contact lenses can correct visual acuity reductions resulting from corneal irregular astigmatism by bridging the irregular corneal surface and the contact lens with the tear film. For more information on irregular astigmatism, see BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal topography is very helpful in evaluating eyes with irregular astigmatism. Topographic changes include nonorthogonal steep and flat meridians (ie, not 90° apart), Figure 1-11. Asymmetry between the superior and inferior or nasal and temporal halves of the cornea may also be revealed by corneal topography, although these patterns are not necessarily indicative of corneal pathology. In contrast, wavefront analysis can demonstrate higher-&#173;order aberrations (such as coma, trefoil, quadrafoil, or secondary astigmatism). The ability to differentiate regular from irregular astigmatism has clinical significance in keratorefractive surgery. Traditional excimer laser ablation can treat spherocylindrical errors but does not effectively treat irregular astigmatism. Topography-&#173;guided ablation may be useful in treating irregular astigmatism not caused by early corneal ectatic disorders.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Limitations of corneal topography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition to the limitations of the specific algorithms and the variations in terminology among manufacturers, the accuracy of corneal topography may be affected by other potential problems:</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Corneal Tomography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Whereas surface corneal curvature (power) is best expressed by Placido imaging, overall corneal shape, including spatial thickness profiles, is best expressed by computed tomography. A variety of imaging systems are available that take multiple slit images and reconstruct them into a corneal-&#173;shape profile, including anterior and posterior corneal elevation data. These include scanning-&#173;slit technology and Scheimpflug-&#173;based imaging systems (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-12</span>). To represent shape directly, color maps may be used to display a <span class="italic">z-height</span> from an arbitrary plane such as the iris plane; however, in order to be clinically useful, corneal surface maps are plotted to show differences from best-fit spheres or other objects that closely mimic the normal corneal shape (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-13</span>). In general, each device calculates the best-fit sphere for each map individually. For this reason, comparing elevation maps is not exact because they frequently have different referenced best-fit sphere characteristics.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Elevation-based tomography is especially helpful in refractive surgery for depicting the anterior and posterior surface shapes of the cornea and lens. With such information, alterations to the shape of the ocular structures can be determined with greater accuracy, especially postoperative changes.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Indications for Corneal Imaging in Refractive Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal topography is an essential part of the preoperative evaluation of refractive surgery candidates. About two-thirds of patients with normal corneas have a symmetric astigmatism pattern that is round, oval, or bow-tie shaped (see Fig&#160;1-10). Asymmetric patterns include asymmetric bow-tie patterns, inferior steepening, superior steepening, skewed radial axes, or other nonspecific irregularities.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal topography detects irregular astigmatism, which may result from abnormal tear film, contact lens warpage, keratoconus and other corneal ectatic disorders, corneal surgery, trauma, scarring, and postinflammatory or degenerative conditions. Repeat topographic examinations may be helpful when the underlying etiology is in question, especially in cases of suspicious steepening patterns in patients who wear contact lenses or who have an abnormal tear film. Contact lens wearers often benefit from extended periods without contact lens wear prior to preoperative planning for refractive surgery; this period allows the corneal map and refraction to stabilize. Patients with keratoconus or other ectatic disorders are not routinely considered for ablative keratorefractive surgery because the abnormal cornea may exhibit an unpredictable response and/or progressive ectasia. Forme fruste, or subclinical, keratoconus typically is considered a contraindication to ablative refractive surgery. Studies are under way to determine the suitability of some keratorefractive procedures in combination with corneal crosslinking as alternative therapeutic modalities for these patients (see also Chapter&#160;7).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal topography and tomography can also be used to demonstrate the effects of keratorefractive procedures. Preoperative and postoperative maps may be compared to determine the refractive effect achieved (<span class="italic">difference map;</span> <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-14</span>). Corneal mapping can also help explain unexpected results, including undercorrection and overcorrection, induced astigmatism, and induced aberrations from small optical zones, decentered ablations, or central islands (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-15</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">The Role of Corneal Topography in Refractive Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal topography is one of the key evaluative technologies in refractive surgery, crucial not only in preoperative screening but also in postoperative evaluation of patients with unexpected results. Topographic analysis should be undertaken in all patients being considered for refractive surgery in order to identify patients who should not undergo the procedure. Although refractive surgery has numerous contraindications (see Chapter&#160;2), some of the most important to recognize are the corneal ectatic disorders: keratoconus and pellucid marginal degeneration (see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for further discussion).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Keratoconus (KC) and pellucid marginal degeneration (PMD) are generally progressive conditions in which thinning occurs in the central, paracentral, or peripheral cornea, resulting in asymmetric corneal steepening and reduced spectacle-&#173;corrected visual acuity. These 2&#160;conditions may be separate entities or different clinical expressions of the same ectatic process; in either case, they are currently contraindications for excimer laser surgery. The topographic pattern in keratoconic eyes usually demonstrates substantial inferonasal or inferotemporal steepening, although severe central and even superior steepening patterns may occur (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-16</span>). The classic topographic pattern in PMD is inferior steepening, which is most dramatic between the 4 and 8&#160;o’clock positions, with superior flattening. This inferior steepening often extends centrally, coming together in what has been described as a “crab-claw” shape (see Chapter&#160;10, Fig&#160;10-2). There may be substantial overlap in the topographic patterns of KC and PMD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The patient who poses the greatest difficulty in preoperative evaluation for refractive surgery is the one in whom KC ultimately develops but who shows no obvious clinical signs at the time of examination. Corneal topography may reveal subtle abnormalities that should alert the surgeon to this problem. Although newer screening indices take into account a variety of topographic factors that may indicate a higher likelihood of subclinical KC, none of these indices is definitive. In addition to topographic metrics, substantial displacement of the thinnest area of the cornea from the center as revealed by corneal tomography is also suggestive of KC. Normal corneas are substantially thicker peripherally than centrally (by approximately 50–60&#160;µm), and corneas that are not thicker peripherally suggest an ectatic disorder. Newer technologies such as high-&#173;resolution anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT), ultra-high-&#173;frequency ultrasound, and hysteresis analysis may be helpful as screening tests for keratoconus by aiding in evaluating the relative position of the posterior and anterior apex, epithelial thickness, and corneal biomechanical properties; however, these technologies have yet to be validated.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-11">Corneal Effects of Keratorefractive Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All keratorefractive procedures induce refractive changes by altering corneal curvature; however, the method by which the alteration is accomplished varies by procedure and by the refractive error being treated. Treatment of myopia requires a <span class="italic">flattening,</span> or decrease, in central corneal curvature, whereas treatment of hyperopia requires a <span class="italic">steepening,</span> or increase, in central corneal curvature. Corneal refractive procedures can be performed using a variety of techniques, including incisional, tissue addition or subtraction, alloplastic material addition, collagen shrinkage, and laser ablation (see the section Laser Biophysics for discussion of laser ablation).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Overall patient satisfaction after refractive surgery depends largely on the successful correction of refractive error and creation of a corneal shape that maximizes visual quality. The natural shape of the cornea is <span class="italic">prolate,</span> or steeper centrally than peripherally. In contrast, an <span class="italic">oblate</span> cornea is steeper peripherally than centrally. The natural prolate corneal shape results in an aspheric optical system, which reduces spherical aberration and therefore minimizes fluctuations in refractive error as the pupil changes size. Oblate corneas, such as those resulting from myopic treatments, increase spherical aberration. Common concerns in patients with substantial spherical aberration include glare, halos, and decreased night vision.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Incisional Techniques</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Incisions perpendicular to the corneal surface alter its shape, depending on the direction, depth, location, length, and number of incisions (see Chapter&#160;4). All incisions cause a local flattening of the cornea. Radial incisions lead to flattening in both the meridian of the incision and the one 90° away. Tangential (arcuate or linear) incisions lead to flattening in the meridian of the incision and steepening in the meridian 90° away that may be equal to or less than the magnitude of the decrease in the primary meridian (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-17</span>); this phenomenon is known as <span class="italic">coupling</span> (see Chapter&#160;3, Fig&#160;3-3).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Reducing the optical zone of the radial incisions increases their effect; similarly, by placing tangential incisions closer to the visual axis, the greater is the effect. In addition, increasing in the length of tangential incision, up to 3&#160;clock-hours, increases the effect.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For optimum effect, an incision should be 85%–90% deep to retain an intact posterior lamella and maximum anterior bowing of the other lamellae. Nomograms for number of incisions and optical zone size can be calculated using finite element analysis, but surgical nomograms are typically generated empirically (eg, see Chapter 3, Table&#160;3-1). The important variables for radial and astigmatic surgery include patient age and the number, depth, and length of incisions. The same incision has greater effect in older patients than it does in younger patients. IOP and preoperative corneal curvature are not significant predictors of effect.</p>

			<p class="h2">Tissue Addition or Subtraction Techniques</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With the exception of laser ablation techniques (discussed in the section Laser Biophysics), lamellar procedures that alter corneal shape through tissue addition or subtraction are primarily of historical interest only. <span class="italic">Keratomileusis</span> for myopia was originated by Barraquer as “carving” of the anterior surface of the cornea. It is defined as a method to modify the spherical or meridional surface of a healthy cornea by tissue subtraction. <span class="italic">Epikeratoplasty</span> (sometimes called <span class="italic">epikeratophakia</span>) adds a precision lathed lenticule of donor tissue to the corneal surface to induce hyperopic or myopic changes. <span class="italic">Keratophakia</span> requires the addition of a tissue lenticule or synthetic inlay intrastromally (see Chapter&#160;4). There is, however, recurring interest in femtosecond laser techniques to excise intrastromal lenticules to alter corneal curvature without the need for excimer laser ablation. These procedures are termed <span class="italic">refractive lenticule extraction (ReLEx), femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEx),</span> and <span class="italic">small-&#173;incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).</span> For further discussion, see Chapter&#160;12. Although early results are promising, these procedures are currently under clinical investigation in the United States.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Alloplastic Material Addition Techniques</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The shape of the cornea can be altered by adding alloplastic material such as hydrogel on the surface or into the corneal stroma to modify the anterior shape or refractive index of the cornea. For example, the 2&#160;arc segments of an intrastromal corneal ring can be placed in 2&#160;pockets of the stroma to directly reshape the surface contour according to the profile and location of the individual rings (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-18</span>). In addition to altering the shape or curvature of the cornea, new inlay materials and designs have been developed that alter the optical function of the cornea—specifically the KAMRA corneal inlay (AcuFocus Inc, Irvine, CA), for presbyopia, approved in 2015. For further discussion, see Chapter&#160;4.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Collagen Shrinkage Techniques</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Alteration in corneal biomechanics can also be achieved by collagen shrinkage. Heating collagen to a critical temperature of 58°–76°C causes it to shrink, inducing changes in the corneal curvature. <span class="italic">Thermokeratoplasty</span> and <span class="italic">conductive keratoplasty (CK)</span> are avoided in the central cornea because of scarring but can be used in the midperiphery to cause local collagen contraction with concurrent central corneal steepening (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-19</span>; see also  Chapter&#160;7).</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Laser–Tissue Interactions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Three different types of laser–tissue interactions are used in keratorefractive surgery: photoablative, photodisruptive, and photothermal. <span class="italic">Photoablation,</span> the most important laser–tissue interaction in refractive surgery, breaks chemical bonds using excimer (from “<span class="italic">exc</span><span class="italic">i</span>ted di<span class="italic">mer</span>”) lasers or other lasers of the appropriate wavelength. Laser energy of 4&#160;eV per photon or greater is sufficient to break carbon–nitrogen or carbon–carbon tissue bonds. Argon-&#173;fluoride (ArF) lasers are excimer lasers that use electrical energy to stimulate argon to form dimers with fluorine gas. They generate a wavelength of 193&#160;nm with 6.4&#160;eV per photon. The 193-nm light is in the ultraviolet&#160;C (high ultraviolet) range, approaching the wavelength of x-rays. In addition to having high energy per photon, light at this end of the electromagnetic spectrum has very low tissue penetrance and thus is suitable for operating on the surface of tissue. This laser energy is capable of great precision, with little thermal spread in tissue; moreover, its lack of penetrance or lethality to cells makes the 193-nm laser nonmutagenic, enhancing its safety. (DNA mutagenicity occurs in the range of 250&#160;nm.) Solid-&#173;state lasers have been designed to generate wavelengths of light near 193&#160;nm without the need to use toxic gas, but the technical difficulties in manufacturing these lasers have limited their clinical use.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The femtosecond laser is approved by the US&#160;Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for creating corneal flaps for LASIK and may also be used to create channels for intrastromal ring segments and for lamellar keratoplasty and PKP. It uses a 1053-nm infrared beam that causes <span class="italic">photodisruption,</span> a process by which tissue is transformed into plasma, and the subsequent high pressure and temperature generated lead to rapid tissue expansion and formation of microscopic cavities within the corneal stroma. Contiguous photodisruption allows for creation of the corneal flap, channel, or keratoplasty incision.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Photothermal</span> effects are achieved by focusing a Ho:YAG laser with a wavelength of 2.13&#160;µm into the anterior stroma. The beam’s energy is absorbed by water in the cornea, and the resulting heat causes local collagen shrinkage and subsequent surface flattening. This technique is approved by the FDA for treating low hyperopia but is not commonly used at present.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Fundamentals of Excimer Laser Photoablation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All photoablative procedures result in the removal of corneal tissue. The amount of tissue removed centrally for myopic treatments using a broad beam laser is estimated by the <span class="italic">Munnerlyn formula:</span></p>
			<p class="equation-single ParaOverride-14"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="BCSC2017-2018_S13_ch01_p001-034-web-resources/image/1.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinical experience has confirmed that the effective change is independent of the initial curvature of the cornea. The Munnerlyn formula highlights some of the problems and limitations of laser vision correction. The amount of ablation increases by the square of the optical zone, but the complications of glare, halos, and regression increase when the optical zone decreases. To reduce these adverse effects, the optical zone should be 6&#160;mm or larger.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With surface ablation, the laser treatment is applied to the Bowman layer and the anterior stroma, LASIK, on the other hand, combines an initial lamellar incision with ablation of the cornea, typically in the stromal bed (see Chapter&#160;5 for further details of surgical technique). Theoretical limits for residual posterior cornea apply the same as they do for PRK. Flaps range in thickness from ultrathin (80–100&#160;µm) to standard (120–180&#160;µm). The thickness and diameter of the LASIK flap depend on instrumentation, corneal diameter, corneal curvature, and corneal thickness.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatments for myopia flatten the cornea by removing central corneal tissue, whereas those for hyperopia steepen the cornea by removing a doughnut-&#173;shaped portion of midperipheral tissue. Some lasers use a multizone treatment algorithm to conserve tissue by employing several concentric optical zones to achieve the total correction required. This method can provide the full correction centrally, while the tapering peripheral zones reduce symptoms and allow higher degrees of myopia to be treated. For an extreme example, 12.00&#160;D of myopia can be treated as follows: 6.00&#160;D are corrected with a 4.5-mm optical zone, 3.00&#160;D with a 5.5-mm optical zone, and 3.00&#160;D with a 6.5-mm optical zone (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-20</span>). Thus, the total 12.00&#160;D correction is achieved in the center using a shallower ablation depth than would be necessary for a single pass (103&#160;µm instead of 169&#160;µm). For hyperopia, surface ablation and LASIK use a similar formula to determine the maximum ablation depth, but the ablation zone is much larger than the optical zone. The zone of maximal ablation coincides with the outer edge of the optical zone. A transition zone of ablated cornea is necessary to blend the edge of the optical zone with the peripheral cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Care must be taken to ensure that enough stromal tissue remains after creation of the LASIK flap and ablation to maintain adequate corneal structure. The historical standard has been to leave a minimum of 250&#160;µm of tissue in the stromal bed, although the exact amount of remaining tissue required to ensure biomechanical stability is not known and likely varies among individuals. See Chapters&#160;2 and&#160;5 for further discussion of these issues.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Types of Photoablative Lasers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Photoablative lasers can be subdivided into broad-beam lasers, scanning-&#173;slit lasers, and flying spot lasers. <span class="italic">Broad-beam lasers</span> have larger-&#173;diameter beams and slower repetition rates and rely on optics or mirrors to create a smooth and homogeneous multimode laser beam of up to approximately 7&#160;mm in diameter. These lasers have very high energy per pulse and require a small number of pulses to ablate the cornea. <span class="italic">Scanning-&#173;slit lasers</span> generate a narrow-&#173;slit laser beam that is scanned over the surface of the tissue to alter the photoablation profile, thus improving the smoothness of the ablated cornea and allowing for larger-&#173;diameter ablation zones. <span class="italic">Flying spot lasers</span> use smaller-&#173;diameter beams (approximately 0.5–2.0&#160;mm) that are scanned at a higher repetition rate; they require use of a tracking mechanism for precise placement of the desired pattern of ablation. Broad-beam lasers and some scanning-&#173;slit lasers require a mechanical iris diaphragm or ablatable mask to create the desired shape in the cornea, whereas the rest of the scanning-&#173;slit lasers and the flying spot lasers use a pattern projected onto the surface to guide the ablation profile without masking. The majority of excimer lasers in current clinical use some form of variable or flying spot ablation profile.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-1">Wavefront-&#173;optimized and wavefront-guided laser ablations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Because conventional laser treatment profiles have small blend zones and create a more oblate corneal shape postoperatively following myopic corrections, they are likely to induce some degree of higher-&#173;order aberration, especially spherical aberration and coma. These aberrations occur because the corneal curvature is relatively more angled peripherally in relation to laser pulses emanating from the central location; thus, the pulses hitting the peripheral cornea are relatively less effective than are the central pulses.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Wavefront-&#173;optimized laser ablation</span> improves the postoperative corneal shape by taking the curvature of the cornea into account and increasing the number of peripheral pulses; this approach minimizes the induction of higher-&#173;order aberrations and often results in better-&#173;quality vision and fewer night-&#173;vision concerns due to maintenance of a more prolate corneal shape. As in conventional procedures, the patient’s refraction alone is used to program the wavefront-&#173;optimized laser ablation. This technology does not directly address preexisting higher-&#173;order aberrations; however, recent studies have found that the vast majority of patients do not have substantial preoperative higher-&#173;order aberrations. It also has the advantage of being quicker than wavefront-&#173;guided technology and avoids the additional expense of the aberrometer.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In <span class="italic">wavefront-&#173;guided laser ablation,</span> information obtained from a wavefront-&#173;sensing aberrometer (which quantifies the aberrations) is transferred electronically to the treatment laser to program the ablation. This process is distinct from those in conventional excimer laser and wavefront-&#173;optimized laser treatments, in which the subjective refraction alone is used to program the laser ablation. The wavefront-&#173;guided laser attempts to treat both lower-&#173;order (ie, myopia or hyperopia and/or astigmatism) and higher-&#173;order aberrations by applying complex ablation patterns to the cornea to correct the wavefront deviations. The correction of higher-&#173;order aberrations requires non–radially symmetric patterns of ablation (which are often much smaller in magnitude than ablations needed to correct defocus and astigmatism). The difference between the desired and the actual wavefront is used to generate a 3-dimensional map of the planned ablation. Accurate registration is required to ensure that the ablation treatment actually delivered to the cornea matches the intended pattern. Such registration is achieved by using marks at the limbus before obtaining the wavefront patterns or by iris registration, which matches reference points in the natural iris pattern to compensate for cyclotorsion and pupil centroid shift. The wavefront-&#173;guided laser then uses a pupil-&#173;tracking system, which helps maintain centration during treatment and allows accurate delivery of the customized ablation profile.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The results for both wavefront-&#173;optimized and wavefront-&#173;guided ablations for myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism are excellent, with well over 90% of eyes achieving 20/40 or better uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCVA; also called <span class="italic">uncorrected distance visual acuity, UDVA</span>). Although most visual acuity parameters are similar between conventional and customized treatments (including both wavefront-&#173;optimized and wavefront-&#173;guided treatments), the majority of recent reports demonstrate improved vision quality when customized treatment profiles are used. Outcomes with wavefront-&#173;optimized treatments are similar to those of wavefront-&#173;guided treatments for most patients, with the exception of patients with substantial preoperative higher-&#173;order aberrations.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Topography-guided laser ablations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topography-&#173;guided lasers are similar in concept to wavefront-&#173;guided lasers, but they link the treatment to the corneal topography rather than to the total wavefront data. Although experience is still early, these instruments may offer significant benefit in the treatment of highly aberrated eyes, such as eyes with previous RK or PKP.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-15">Corneal Wound Healing</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All forms of keratorefractive surgery are exquisitely dependent on corneal wound healing to achieve the desired results. Satisfactory results require either modifying or reducing wound healing or exploiting normal wound healing for the benefit of the patient. For example, astigmatic keratotomy requires initial weakening of the cornea followed by permanent corneal healing, with replacement of the epithelial plugs with collagen and remodeling of the collagen to ensure stability and avoid long-term hyperopic drift. PRK requires the epithelium to heal quickly, and with minimal stimulation of the underlying keratocytes, to avoid corneal scarring and haze. Lamellar keratoplasty requires intact epithelium and healthy endothelium early in the postoperative period to seal the flap. Later, the cornea must heal in the periphery to secure the flap in place and avoid late-term displacement while minimizing irregular astigmatism; also, the cornea must remain devoid of significant healing centrally to maintain a clear visual axis. In addition to stromal healing, regeneration of the corneal nerves is crucial to a normal ocular surface and good visual function. Delay or difficulty in re-&#173;innervation can lead to problems with corneal sensation and tear-film stability and to dry eye symptoms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The understanding of corneal wound healing has advanced tremendously with recognition of the multiple factors involved in the cascade of events initiated by corneal wounding. The cascade is somewhat dependent on the nature of the injury. Injury to the epithelium can lead to loss of underlying keratocytes from apoptosis. The remaining keratocytes respond by generating new glycosaminoglycans and collagen, to a degree dependent on the duration of the epithelial defect and the depth of the stromal injury. Corneal haze is localized in the subepithelial anterior stroma and may persist for several years after surface ablation. Clinically significant haze, however, is present in only a small percentage of eyes. The tendency toward haze formation is greater with deeper ablations, increased surface irregularity, and prolonged absence of the epithelium. Despite loss of the Bowman layer, normal or even enhanced numbers of hemidesmosomes and anchoring fibrils form to secure the epithelium to the stroma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Controversy persists over the value of different drugs for modulating wound healing in surface ablation. Typically, clinicians in the United States use corticosteroids in a tapering manner following surgery to reduce inflammation. Mitomycin&#160;C has been applied to the stromal bed after excimer surface ablation to attempt to decrease haze formation (see Chapters&#160;5 and&#160;6). Vitamin&#160;C has been postulated to play a role in protecting the cornea from ultraviolet light damage by the excimer laser, but no randomized, prospective clinical trial has yet been performed. Various growth factors that have been found to promote wound healing after PRK, including transforming growth factor&#160;<span class="greek--tx-">b</span>, may be useful in the future.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Haze formation does not seem to occur in the central flap interface after LASIK, which may be related either to lack of significant epithelial injury and consequent subcellular signaling or to maintenance of some intact surface neurons. LASIK shows very little long-term evidence of healing between the disrupted lamellae and only typical stromal healing at the peripheral wound. The lamellae are initially held in position by negative stromal pressure generated by the endothelial cells aided by an intact epithelial surface. Even years after treatment, the lamellar interface can be broken and the flap lifted, indicating that only a minimal amount of healing occurs. LASIK flaps can also be dislodged secondary to trauma many years postoperatively.</p>
