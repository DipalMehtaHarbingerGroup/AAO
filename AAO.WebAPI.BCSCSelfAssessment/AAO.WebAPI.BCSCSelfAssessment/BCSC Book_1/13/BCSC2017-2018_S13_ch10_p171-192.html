			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Over the past 3&#160;decades, the field of refractive surgery has evolved into a subspecialty with finely tuned, computer- and laser-&#173;assisted procedures that play an important role in the surgical armamentarium of today’s ophthalmologists. As the spectrum of indications for refractive surgery has grown, so has the prevalence of patients with concomitant known ocular or systemic diseases who wish to undergo these procedures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">During this period, many patients excluded from the original United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) clinical trials have been successfully treated with refractive surgery, and some formerly absolute contraindications have been changed to relative contraindications. With increased experience, laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) have been performed safely and effectively in patients with ocular or systemic diseases. Nevertheless, the use of these procedures on patients whose conditions would have excluded them from participation in the original FDA protocols is considered off-&#173;label. Performing off-&#173;label surgery is neither illegal nor medically incorrect if, in the surgeon’s judgment, the benefit of a surgical procedure outweighs the potential risk to a patient. However, it is the surgeon’s ethical, legal, and medical responsibility to explain the concept of off-&#173;label surgery to the patient, to determine whether the procedure meets the standard of care in the community, and emphasize to the patient the unknown risk associated as a result of using an off-&#173;label non–FDA-&#173;approved protocol.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In higher-&#173;risk patients, unilateral surgery may offer the advantage of providing assurance that one eye is doing well before surgery is performed on the second eye. In addition, when deciding whether a patient with connective tissue disease or immunosuppression is an appropriate candidate for refractive surgery, the surgeon may find that consultation with the patient’s primary physician or rheumatologist provides important information about the patient’s systemic health.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The process of consent should be altered, not only to inform the patient, but also to document the patient’s understanding of the additional risks and limitations of postoperative results associated with any coexisting ocular or systemic diseases. The refractive surgeon may choose to supplement the standard written consent with additional points to highlight specific concerns. The ophthalmologist should assiduously avoid the high-risk refractive surgery patient who volunteers to sign any preoperative consent because “I&#160;know these complications won’t happen to me.” Such patients have not heard or understood the informed consent discussion.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Ocular Surface Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dry eye after LASIK is the most common and anticipated complication of refractive surgery, although symptoms are typically self-&#173;limited. During creation of the flap, corneal nerves are severed, which may result in corneal anesthesia lasting 3–6&#160;months and may less frequently persist for years. As a result, many patients develop keratopathy, decreased tear production, and related symptoms as a result of the neurotrophic state of their cornea. Patients who had dry eyes prior to surgery, or whose eyes were marginally compensated before surgery, may experience more severe symptoms postoperatively. These individuals demonstrate tear-film and ocular surface disruption and often report fluctuating vision between blinks throughout the day. In a review of 109&#160;patients who had undergone LASIK surgery, Levinson and colleagues found that dry eye symptoms and blepharitis were the most common diagnoses among patients dissatisfied with the procedure, even for patients with relatively good postoperative vision outcomes. Fortunately, in the great majority of these patients, symptoms resolve 3–6&#160;months after surgery but those whose symptoms persist are among the least satisfied in this series.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ophthalmologists may take several steps to reduce the incidence and severity of dry eye symptoms after refractive surgery. One of the most important is to screen patients carefully for dry eye and tear-film abnormalities and to treat them aggressively before surgery. Many patients seeking refractive surgery are actually dry eye patients who are intolerant of contact lens wear because of their preexisting dry eye disease. Any history of contact lens intolerance should suggest the possibility of underlying dry eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any refractive surgery candidate with signs or symptoms of dry eye should be thoroughly evaluated. Patient history should include questions about collagen vascular diseases and conjunctival cicatrizing disorders; these conditions are relative contraindications to refractive procedures and should be addressed prior to any surgical consideration (see Chapter&#160;2).</p>
			<p class="body-text">External examination should include evaluation of eyelid anatomy and function for conditions such as incomplete blink, lagophthalmos, entropion, ectropion, and eyelid notching. On slit-lamp examination, the ophthalmologist should note anterior and posterior blepharitis, tear-film quantity and quality, and the presence of conjunctivochalasis, subconjunctival fibrosis, or symblepharon. Screening questionnaires to highlight or elicit dry eye–related symptoms could help start the discussion and lead to further workup. Ancillary testing for dry eyes (eg, Schirmer testing, tear breakup time, fluorescein corneal staining, lissamine green or rose bengal conjunctival staining) should be performed on all patients considering refractive surgery. Corneal topography should be reviewed for evidence of irregularity or patchy, poor image quality often seen in the presence of an unstable tear film. A screening evaluation in patients considering refractive surgery may also include other testing. An immunoassay for matrix metalloproteinase 9&#160;levels, as an inflammatory biomarker in the tear film, and tear osmolarity measurement, as an indicator of tear deficiency, could be helpful in screening for ocular surface disease. Imaging the quality of the tear lipid layer and the health of the meibomian gland structure and function are other tools for screening at-risk patients. Once the at-risk patient is identified, aggressive preoperative treatment often leads to better outcomes, fewer complications, and patients more satisfied with the results of surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of ocular surface disease with aqueous deficiency may include topical tear replacement, punctal occlusion, and use of topical anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids or cyclosporine (see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>). Topical cyclosporine improves dry eye and refractive outcomes in patients with dry eye who are undergoing LASIK and surface ablation. Patients with ocular surface disease and blepharitis or meibomitis should be instructed in the use of hygienic eyelid scrubs and dietary supplements, such as flaxseed or omega-3 fish oils, to improve the tear film. Meibomian gland expression, oral or topical medications (eg, doxycycline or azithromycin), and a short course of topical corticosteroids may help improve the quality of the tear film and optimize the ocular surface prior to surgery. A delay in surgery may be necessary to allow time for treatment response. In addition, patients must be cautioned that their dry eye condition may worsen postoperatively. Such an occurrence may result in additional discomfort or decreased vision and may be permanent.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Herpes Simplex Virus Infection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many surgeons avoid laser vision correction in patients with a history of herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis because of the risk of recurrent disease induced by the surgery. Trauma from the lamellar dissection or exposure to the excimer laser may reactivate the virus and cause recurrent HSV keratitis. However, some authors have concluded that the recurrence reflects simply the natural course of the disease rather than reactivation due to excimer laser ablation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The role of excimer laser ablation in inciting recurrence of HSV keratitis has been investigated in the laboratory. Rabbits infected with HSV type&#160;1 demonstrated viral reactivation after exposure of the corneal stroma to 193-nm ultraviolet radiation during PRK and LASIK. Pretreatment with systemic valacyclovir before the laser treatment decreased the rate of recurrence in the rabbit model. In another study, a rabbit latency model demonstrated that systemic valacyclovir reduced ocular shedding of HSV after LASIK.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Reactivation of HSV keratitis has been reported in humans after radial keratotomy (RK), phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), PRK, and LASIK. Fagerholm and colleagues reported a 25% incidence of postoperative HSV keratitis 17&#160;months after PTK for surface irregularities from prior HSV infections, compared with an 18% recurrence rate in an equivalent time period prior to PTK. The authors concluded that the procedure does not seem to significantly increase the incidence of recurrences.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A retrospective review of 13,200&#160;PRK-treated eyes with no history of corneal HSV revealed a 0.14% incidence of HSV keratitis. Of these cases, 16.5% occurred within 10&#160;days of the procedure; the authors postulated that this finding may indicate a direct effect of the excimer ultraviolet laser. In 78% of cases, HSV keratitis occurred within 15&#160;weeks, which could be related to the corticosteroid therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Reactivation of herpes zoster ophthalmicus was also reported in 1&#160;case after LASIK, in association with vesiculo-&#173;ulcerative lesions on the tip of the nose. The few cases in which herpes zoster ophthalmicus was reactivated responded to topical and oral antiviral treatment with excellent recovery of vision. There are anecdotal reports of flap interface inflammation resembling diffuse lamellar keratitis after LASIK in patients with herpes simplex or herpes zoster keratitis. In these cases, topical corticosteroids may also be required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Due to the potential for vision loss from recurrence of HSV keratitis, some refractive surgeons consider prior herpetic keratitis a contraindication to refractive surgery. Others may consider performing PRK, PTK, or LASIK in patients with a history of HSV keratitis who have not had any recent recurrences and who have good corneal sensation, minimal or no corneal vascularization or scarring, and normal best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA; also called <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity, CDVA</span>). Preoperative and postoperative prophylaxis with systemic antiviral drugs should be strongly considered in these patients. Results of the Herpetic Eye Disease Study (HEDS) showed only a 50% reduction in the risk of recurrence with a prophylactic dose of oral acyclovir over the course of 1&#160;year in patients with latent HSV even with no inciting factors, such as treatment with an excimer laser. Patients with pronounced corneal hypoesthesia or anesthesia, vascularization, thinning and scarring, or recent herpetic attacks should not be considered candidates for refractive surgery. Any patient with a history of herpes simplex or herpes zoster keratitis must be counseled about the continued risk of recurrence and its concomitant potential for vision loss after excimer laser vision correction.</p>

			<p class="h2">Keratoconus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Keratoconus is generally considered a contraindication to LASIK and surface ablation. Weakening of the cornea, as a result of the loss of structural integrity involved in creating the LASIK flap, and removal of tissue significantly increase the risk of exacerbation of ectasia. Although advanced stages of keratoconus can be diagnosed by slit-lamp examination, more sensitive analyses using corneal topography and corneal pachymetry can reveal findings early in the disease process. No specific agreed-&#173;upon test or measurement is diagnostic of a corneal ectatic disorder, but corneal topography and corneal pachymetry should be part of the evaluation. Subtle corneal thinning, curvature, or elevation changes can be overlooked on slit-lamp evaluation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In cases of forme fruste keratoconus where the fellow eye is seemingly normal, studies have suggested several risk factors for progression to keratoconus in the fellow eye and post-&#173;LASIK ectasia in either eye. These include interocular asymmetry of inferior corneal steepening or asymmetric bow-tie topographic patterns with skewed steep radial axes above and below the horizontal meridian (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-1</span>). Keratoconus suspect patients have the aforementioned features in either or both eyes. LASIK using current technology should not be considered in such patients. Patients with an inferior “crab-claw” pattern accompanied by central flattening are at risk of developing pellucid marginal degeneration or a “low-&#173;sagging cone” variety of keratoconus, even in the absence of clinical signs (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-2</span>). This pattern may be designated “pellucid suspect,” and LASIK should be avoided in eyes that exhibit it.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Global pachymetry measurements may help rule out forme fruste keratoconus. Posterior curvature evaluation with newer corneal imaging technology may also prove significant (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-3</span>). Often, the refractive surgeon is the first physician to detect and inform a patient of the existence of corneal ectasia. The patient may have excellent vision with glasses or contact lenses and may be seeking the convenience of a more permanent correction through LASIK. It is important that the ophthalmologist clearly convey that, although the presence of forme fruste keratoconus does not necessarily indicate the presence of a progressive disease, refractive surgery should not be performed because of the potential for unpredictable results and vision loss. The patient should also be informed of the importance of follow-&#173;up for any signs of progression, as corneal crosslinking (CCL) may be an option for stabilization of their corneal condition.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intrastromal corneal ring segments are FDA approved for keratoconus (see Chapter&#160;4). CCL with riboflavin administration and ultraviolet-A exposure shows promising early results and may prove effective in preventing and treating corneal ectasia (see Chapter&#160;7 and BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>). Although some early case reports have suggested that combining CCL treatments with PRK may offer some benefit to keratoconus patients, the clinical experience remains preliminary.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Other Corneal Dystrophies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Basement membrane dystrophy (also called <span class="italic">map-dot-&#173;fingerprint dystrophy</span>) is a common corneal dystrophy that can be an incidental finding in many asymptomatic patients. In determining the safety of refractive surgery in these eyes, one must ensure that the irregularity in the epithelium is not impacting the refractive error being treated, nor is it causing visually significant irregularity in the central corneal surface. If the eye is deemed stable to proceed with laser refractive surgery, surface ablation may be the preferred approach. In addition, surface treatment may help reduce irregular astigmatism and recurrent erosions, which are frequent in these patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The experience and published reports of refractive surgery in patients with Fuchs endothelial dystrophy are limited. Among the small number of patients with mild guttae and family history of Fuchs dystrophy who, following LASIK, were evaluated and reported on, the majority developed progressive corneal edema, loss of endothelial cells, and loss of BCVA. The progressive nature of this disease and the fluctuations in the corneal refractive power due to the fluctuating edema make these eyes difficult to stabilize for accurate measurements and postoperative management.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Post–Penetrating Keratoplasty</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Refractive unpredictability after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) is extremely common owing to the inherent imprecision of the operation. Most series document a mean postoperative astigmatism of 4.00–5.00&#160;D. In many cases, these refractive errors are not amenable to spectacle correction, and 10%–30% of patients require rigid gas-&#173;permeable contact lens correction to achieve good vision after PKP. However, contact lens fitting may not be successful in this patient population due to abnormal corneal curvature or the patient’s inability to tolerate or manipulate a contact lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgical alternatives for the correction of post-PKP astigmatism include astigmatic keratotomy, compression sutures, and wedge resections. In a series of 201&#160;corneal transplants for keratoconus, 18% of patients required refractive surgery to correct the astigmatism. Although these procedures can significantly decrease corneal cylinder and are highly effective, they have minimal effect on spherical equivalent. In addition, they can be unpredictable and may destabilize the graft–host wound.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Phakic eyes with significant corneal astigmatism after suture removal could undergo crystalline lens replacement with a toric intraocular lens if the astigmatism is regular centrally and has stabilized. Patients with significant anisometropia after PKP surgery may be candidates for intraocular lens (IOL) exchange or piggyback IOL implantation (see Chapter&#160;8). These alternatives require another intraocular procedure, which increases the risk of endothelial decompensation, glaucoma, and cystoid macular edema and may incite graft rejection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Given the successful use of the excimer laser in treating myopia and astigmatism, PRK has been studied and used to treat post-PKP refractive errors. PRK has the disadvantages associated with epithelial removal in a corneal transplant and may result in corneal haze when high refractive errors are treated. With the use of prophylactic topical mitomycin&#160;C, PRK has become a more acceptable treatment option for refractive errors after PKP. Although the refractive results are often good, PRK in patients who had past PKP is generally less predictable and less effective than it is for naturally occurring astigmatism and myopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">LASIK after PKP is subject to the same patient-&#173;selection constraints as conventional LASIK. Without extenuating circumstances, patients with monocular vision or patients with limited vision potential in the fellow eye usually are poor candidates. In addition, patients with a wound-&#173;healing disorder, significant dry eye syndrome, or a collagen-&#173;vascular disease should be offered other options. Finally, patients should have realistic expectations for their rehabilitation after post-PKP LASIK. The goal of LASIK following PKP is to return the patient to spectacle-&#173;corrected binocularity or to enable the patient to wear contact lenses successfully, as the accuracy of the procedure is less predictable than that of conventional LASIK. Also, note that there are no FDA-&#173;approved procedures at this time to treat irregular astigmatism. Preoperative evaluation of the post-PKP patient who is considering refractive surgery should include the original indications for the PKP. It has been the experience of many surgeons that patients with low endothelial cell counts may be at increased risk of flap dislocation after LASIK because of impairment of the endothelial cell pump function.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Optimal timing of refractive surgery after PKP is controversial. All sutures should be removed, and the refraction should be stable. To avoid wound dehiscence, many surgeons wait at least 1&#160;year after PKP, and an additional 4&#160;months after all sutures are removed, before performing the refractive surgery. An interval of at least 18–24&#160;months after PKP provides sufficient wound healing in most cases. No matter how much time has elapsed since the PKP surgery, the entirety of the graft–host wound should be carefully inspected to identify areas of variability in coaptation of the graft–host junction. Complications that can occur with a LASIK procedure include a small but significant risk of keratoplasty wound dehiscence during application of the vacuum ring used to create the LASIK flap, or during PRK or astigmatic keratotomy procedures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Refraction and corneal topography should be stable, as documented by 2&#160;consecutive readings on separate visits at least 1&#160;month apart. Areas of stromal thinning should be confirmed to avoid exacerbation or, in extreme cases, perforation during LASIK flap creation. Refractive surgery should be avoided if the corneal graft shows evidence of inflammation, diffuse vascularization, ectasia, inadequate healing of the graft–host interface, refractive instability, or if there are signs of rejection or endothelial decompensation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because eye alignment under the laser is crucial for accurate treatment of astigmatism, some surgeons mark the vertical or horizontal axis of the cornea at the slit lamp before placing the patient under the laser. If the corneal curvature is very steep, cutting a thicker flap during the microkeratome pass may decrease the risk of buttonhole formation. PRK should also be considered in steep corneas to avoid flap complications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another potential problem specific to post-PKP LASIK is that the creation of a lamellar flap may itself cause a change in the amount and axis of the astigmatism. Therefore, some surgeons perform LASIK in 2&#160;stages. In the first stage, the flap is cut and laid back down. Several weeks later, after the curvature and refraction have stabilized, the second stage is performed, where the flap is lifted and laser ablation is applied. Some reports describe minimal refractive changes after flap creation, and some surgeons prefer to perform LASIK in 1&#160;stage to avoid increasing the potential for the complications associated with performing 2&#160;separate procedures, including infection, graft rejection, and epithelial ingrowth. Flap retraction and necrosis have been reported in patients undergoing LASIK after keratoplasty.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The mean percentage reduction of astigmatism after LASIK following PKP ranges from 54.0% to 87.9%. Although most series report improvement in uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA; also called <span class="italic">uncorrected distance visual acuity, UDVA</span>), up to 42.9% of patients require enhancement because of cylindrical undercorrection. In addition, up to 35% of patients in some series have lost 1&#160;line of BCVA. Corneal graft rejection has been described after PRK; thus, higher and more prolonged dosing with topical corticosteroids should be prescribed for post-PKP refractive surgery patients to decrease this risk.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Ocular Hypertension and Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An estimated 9%–28% of patients with myopia have primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Consequently, it is likely that some patients with glaucoma will request refractive surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Of particular concern in patients with ocular hypertension or POAG is the effect of the acute rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) to more than 65&#160;mm&#160;Hg when suction is applied while the stromal flap is cut for LASIK or the epithelial flap for epipolis LASIK (epi-&#173;LASIK). There have been reports of new visual field defects arising immediately after LASIK that are attributed to mechanical compression or ischemia of the optic nerve head from the temporary increase in IOP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Evaluation of a patient with ocular hypertension or POAG includes a complete history and ocular examination with peripheral visual field testing and corneal pachymetry. A history of poor IOP control, nonadherence to treatment, maximal medical therapy, or prior surgical interventions may suggest progressive disease, which may contraindicate refractive surgery. The surgeon should also note the status of the angle, the presence and amount of optic nerve cupping, and the degree of visual field loss, especially if split fixation is present.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several reports have confirmed that central corneal thickness affects the Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) and the Tono-&#173;Pen (Reichert Technologies, Depew, NY) measurement of IOP (see the section Glaucoma After Refractive Surgery in Chapter&#160;11). The principle of applanation tonometry assumes a corneal thickness of 520&#160;µm. Studies have demonstrated that thinner-than-&#173;normal corneas give falsely low IOP readings, whereas thicker corneas give falsely high readings. For example, IOP is underestimated by approximately 5.2&#160;mm&#160;Hg in a cornea with a central thickness of 450&#160;µm. Although all reports agree that central corneal thickness affects GAT&#160;IOP measurement, there is no consensus on a specific formula to compensate for this effect in clinical practice.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the treatment of myopia, LASIK and surface ablation procedures remove tissue to reduce the steepness of the cornea; this sculpting process creates a thinner central cornea, which leads to artifactually low IOP measurements postoperatively. Such inaccurately low central applanation tonometry measurements hinder the diagnosis of corticosteroid-&#173;induced glaucoma after keratorefractive procedures, resulting in optic nerve cupping, visual field loss, and decreased visual acuity (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because of the difficulty that PRK and LASIK cause in the accurate measurement of IOP, these refractive procedures should not be considered for a patient whose IOP is poorly controlled. Furthermore, patients should be advised of the effect of refractive surgery on their IOP measurements and urged to inform future ophthalmologists about their surgery. Patients should be referred to a glaucoma specialist when indicated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with ocular hypertension can often safely undergo refractive surgery. Such patients must be counseled preoperatively that refractive surgery treats only the refractive error and not the natural history of the ocular hypertension, which can sometimes pro&#173;gress to glaucoma, accompanied by optic nerve cupping and visual field loss. The ophthalmologist should pay particular attention to the risk factors for progression to glaucoma, including older age, reduced corneal thickness, increased cup–disc ratio, family history of glaucoma, and elevated IOP. Each patient needs to understand that after excimer laser ablation, it is more difficult to accurately assess IOP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The decision about whether to perform refractive surgery in a patient with glaucoma is controversial. There are no long-term studies on refractive surgery in this population. LASIK is contraindicated in any patient with marked optic nerve cupping, visual field loss, or visual acuity loss. The refractive surgeon may ask the patient to sign an ancillary consent form that documents the patient’s understanding that POAG may cause progressive vision loss independent of any refractive surgery and that IOP elevation during a LASIK or epi-&#173;LASIK procedure, or following LASIK or surface ablation (often due to a corticosteroid response), can cause glaucoma progression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgeon should be aware that placement of a suction ring may not be possible if there is a functioning filtering bleb or a tube shunt. In rare cases in which both filtering surgery and LASIK are being planned, it is preferable to perform LASIK before the filter is placed. Suction time should be minimized to decrease the chance of optic nerve damage from the transient increase in IOP. Alternatively, PRK or laser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) may be preferable because each avoids the IOP rise associated with LASIK flap creation. The surgeon must exercise caution when using postoperative corticosteroids because of their potential for elevating IOP. The patient should be informed as to when to resume postoperative topical medications for glaucoma. Finally, to avoid trauma to the flap, IOP should generally not be checked for at least 72&#160;hours.</p>

			<p class="h3-h2">High myopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with high myopia are at increased risk of retinal tears and detachment. A thorough, dilated retinal examination (including scleral depression, if indicated) should be performed on all patients with high myopia, and a referral to a retina specialist should be considered for patients with predisposing retinal pathology. One study of 4800&#160;consecutive patients in a private refractive surgery practice found that 52 (1.1%) had posterior segment pathology that required intervention. Another study of 29,916&#160;myopic and hyperopic eyes undergoing LASIK demonstrated that 1.5% of patients required preoperative treatment of retinal pathology.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Retinal detachment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with high myopia should be counseled that refractive surgery corrects only the refractive aspect of the myopia and not the natural history of the highly myopic eye with its known complications. Such patients remain at risk of retinal tears and detachment throughout their lives, despite refractive surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although no causal link has been established between retinal detachment and excimer laser refractive surgery, the potential adverse effects should be considered. The rapid increase and then decrease in IOP could theoretically stretch the vitreous base, and the acoustic shock waves from the laser could play a role in the development of a posterior vitreous detachment. Although the actual risk to eyes with high myopia or preexisting retinal pathology has not been determined through well-&#173;controlled, long-term studies, current data suggest that radial keratotomy, surface ablation, and LASIK do not appear to increase the incidence of retinal detachment. The occurrence of retinal detachment after LASIK ranges from 0.034% to 0.250%. In a series of 1554&#160;eyes that underwent LASIK for myopia with a mean refractive error of –13.52 ± 3.38&#160;D, retinal detachments developed in 4 eyes (0.25%) at 11.25 ± 8.53&#160;months after the procedure. Three of the eyes had retinal flap tears, and 1&#160;eye had an atrophic hole. There was no statistically significant difference in BCVA before and after conventional retinal reattachment surgery. A myopic shift did result from the scleral buckle, however.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In a study of 38,823&#160;eyes with a mean myopia of –6.00&#160;D, the frequency of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments at a mean of 16.3&#160;months after LASIK was 0.8%. The eyes that developed retinal detachments had a mean preoperative myopia of –8.75&#160;D. In a retrospective review, Blumenkranz reported that the frequency of retinal detachment after excimer laser treatment was similar to the frequency in the general population, averaging 0.034% over 2&#160;years. It would be important for the LASIK surgeon to let the operating retinal surgeon know that LASIK has previously been performed on the patient, because of the potential for flap dehiscence during retinal detachment surgery, especially during corneal epithelial scraping.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Highly myopic eyes undergoing phakic IOL procedures are at risk of retinal detachment from the underlying high myopia, as well as from the intraocular surgery. A retinal detachment rate of 4.8% was reported in a study of phakic IOLs used to correct high myopia.</p>

			<p class="h3">Previous retinal detachment surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients who have had prior scleral buckle surgery or vitrectomy may seek refractive surgery because of resultant myopia. Prior retinal detachment surgery can result in a myopic shift because of axial elongation of the eye from indentation of the scleral buckle. Refractive surgery can be considered in selected cases that have symptomatic anisometropia with good BCVA. The surgeon should determine whether the scleral buckle or conjunctival scarring will interfere with placement of the suction ring in preparation for creation of the LASIK flap. If it will, PRK may be considered instead of LASIK. Preoperative pathology, including preexisting macular pathology, will continue to limit UCVA and BCVA after refractive surgery. There are no published long-term series of the results of excimer laser vision correction in patients with prior retinal detachment surgery. Both the patient and the surgeon should realize that the final visual results may not be as predictable as after other refractive surgeries. Patients should also be aware that if the scleral buckle needs to be removed, the refractive error could change dramatically. Unexpected corneal steepening has been reported in patients undergoing LASIK with previously placed scleral buckles.</p>

			<p class="h2">Amblyopia and Strabismus in Adults and Children</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Amblyopia and anisometropic amblyopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Amblyopia is defined as a decrease in visual acuity without evidence of organic eye disease, typically resulting from unequal visual stimulation during the period of visual development. The prevalence of amblyopia is 2%–4% of the US population; up to half of these cases represent anisometropic amblyopia. Patients with anisometropia greater than 3.00&#160;D between the 2&#160;eyes are likely to develop amblyopia that may be more resistant to traditional amblyopia therapy, such as glasses, contact lenses, patching, or atropine penalization therapy, partly because of the significant amount of induced aniseikonia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Evaluation of a patient with amblyopia should include a thorough medical history to identify any known cause of amblyopia, a history of ocular disease or surgery, assessment of ocular alignment and motility, and a comprehensive anterior segment and retinal examination. Patients should be referred to a strabismus specialist when indicated. Preoperative counseling of a patient with amblyopia must emphasize that, even after refractive surgery, the vision in the amblyopic eye will not be as good as that in the nonamblyopic eye. The patient should also understand that BCVA will be the same, or nearly so, with or without refractive surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Typically, refractive surgery is performed in this group of patients to treat high anisometropia or astigmatism in 1&#160;eye or high refractive error in both eyes. Laser vision correction and phakic IOL implantation have been successfully performed in the more myopic, amblyopic eye in adult patients with anisometropic amblyopia. Some studies suggest that postoperative BCVA may even improve modestly compared with preoperative levels in a subset of adults who undergo refractive surgery. In a study examining phakic IOL implantation in patients with greater than 3.00&#160;D of anisometropia, an average of 3&#160;lines of vision were gained; 91% of eyes gained more than 1&#160;line, and no eyes lost BCVA. This improvement in vision was attributed to an increase in magnification and a decrease in optical aberrations, rather than an actual improvement in the amblyopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Performing refractive surgery in the normal eye of the adult patient with amblyopia, however, is controversial. The decision to do so depends on many factors, including the level of BCVA in the amblyopic eye and the normal eye as well as the ocular alignment. To increase safety, unilateral surgery in the amblyopic eye followed by surgery in the nonamblyopic eye can be considered. However, ocular alignment deviation has been reported after unilateral LASIK for high myopia because of focus disparity causing esodeviation and impairment of fusion. In some cases, a preoperative contact lens trial may help in assessing this potential risk.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Consider a patient with anisometropic amblyopia whose vision is corrected to 20/40 with –7.00&#160;D in the right eye and to 20/20 with –1.00&#160;D in the left eye. This patient may be an excellent candidate for refractive surgery in the amblyopic right eye because he or she probably cannot tolerate glasses to correct the anisometropic amblyopia and may not tolerate contact lenses. Even if the post-&#173;LASIK UCVA were worse than 20/40 in the amblyopic eye, it would be better than the pre-&#173;LASIK UCVA of counting fingers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the postoperative UCVA in the amblyopic right eye improved to 20/40, the patient could be considered for laser vision correction in the left eye for –1.00&#160;D. However, if the patient had presbyopia, some surgeons would discourage further intervention and discuss potential advantages of the low myopia. In a younger patient with accommodation, some surgeons would inform the patient of the potential risks associated with treating the better eye but would perform the excimer laser vision correction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If BCVA in the amblyopic eye were 20/200 or worse, the patient would be considered legally blind if he or she were to lose significant vision after laser refractive surgery in the normal eye. In such cases, refractive surgery in the amblyopic eye may or may not offer much benefit, and refractive surgery in the nonamblyopic eye should be regarded as contraindicated in most cases. In the extenuating circumstances for which such surgery might be considered, the physician and patient should have an extensive discussion about the potential risks. Generally, if the patient would not be happy with the vision in the amblyopic eye alone in the event that something adverse happened to the better eye, then refractive surgery should not be performed on the better eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Persistent diplopia has been reported after bilateral LASIK in a patient with anisometropic amblyopia and a history of intermittent diplopia in childhood. Preoperatively, this type of patient can adjust to the disparity of the retinal image sizes with spectacle correction. Refractive surgery, however, can result in a dissimilar retinal image size that the patient cannot fuse, resulting in diplopia. This type of diplopia cannot be treated by prisms or muscle surgery.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Refractive surgery in children</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In children, refractive surgery is controversial because their eyes and refractive status continue to change. Additional studies on the growing eye and the long-term effect of excimer laser treatment and phakic IOLs on the corneal endothelium and lens are needed to better assess the outcome of refractive surgery in children. Consequently, these procedures are typically regarded as investigational.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, the literature is replete with reports of the successful performance of PRK, LASEK, LASIK, and phakic IOL implantation in children, mostly 8&#160;years and older, when conventional therapies have failed. Most of these children underwent treatment for anisometropic amblyopia in the more myopic eye. In these studies, refractive error was decreased and visual acuity was maintained or improved in moderately amblyopic eyes. Refractive surgery did not improve BCVA or stereopsis in older children with densely amblyopic eyes. The limited effect on visual acuity was generally attributed to the fact that the children were beyond amblyogenic age. In 1&#160;study, general anesthesia was used during performance of PRK in 40&#160;children, aged 1–6&#160;years, who were unable to wear glasses or contact lenses for high myopia or anisometropic amblyopia from myopia. Patients were treated for existing amblyopia, and mean BCVA improved from 20/70 to 20/40. The study found that posttreatment corneal haze developed in 60% of eyes. Most patients demonstrated “increasing corneal clarity” within 1&#160;year, although 2 of 27&#160;patients required PTK for the corneal haze. Regression of effect was attributed to a vigorous healing response and the axial myopic shift associated with growth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several studies have reported successful implantation of phakic IOLs in children with high anisometropia and amblyopia. This technique eliminates the previously mentioned corneal-wound-&#173;healing problems associated with keratorefractive procedures and may be considered when the refractive error is high and other traditional methods of amblyopia therapy have failed. Depending on the type of phakic IOL, however, other potentially serious complications may ensue, including progressive corneal endothelial cell loss, cataract formation, pupillary block glaucoma, and persistent inflammation, as well as the usual risks associated with intraocular surgery. Thus, phakic IOLs should be considered investigational in children. Larger clinical trials are necessary to adequately evaluate the safety and efficacy of this technique in this age group. Furthermore, these patients should be monitored for endothelial evaluation through the years.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Accommodative esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Uncorrected hyperopia can stimulate an increase in accommodation, leading to accommodative convergence. Esotropia arises from insufficient fusional divergence. Traditional treatment includes correction of hyperopia with glasses or contact lenses and muscle surgery for any residual esotropia (see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>). While glasses or contact lenses are being worn, the esotropia is usually not manifest. As a child ages, the hyperopia typically decreases, with concomitant resolution of the accommodative esotropia. If significant hyperopia persists, glasses or contact lenses continue to be needed to control the esotropia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Before refractive surgery, it is important to perform an adequate cycloplegic refraction (using cyclopentolate, 1%) on patients younger than 35&#160;years who have intermittent strabismus or phoria. Accurate refraction is necessary to avoid inducing postoperative hyperopia. Otherwise, the postoperative hyperopia may result in a new onset of esotropia with an accommodative element.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several studies performed outside the US report the use of PRK and LASIK for adults with accommodative esotropia. In one of the studies, orthophoria or microesotropia was achieved after LASIK for hyperopia in accommodative esotropia in a series of 9&#160;patients older than 18&#160;years. A second study demonstrated a reduction in the mean esotropia of 21&#160;prism diopters (<span class="greek--tx-">D</span>) prior to LASIK to 3.7<span class="greek--tx-">D</span> after surgery.

			<p class="h2-h1">Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Little has been written about refractive surgery in patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and individual opinions vary. Note that the FDA recommends that patients with an immunodeficiency disease not undergo LASIK, regardless of the excimer platform, because the risk outweighs the benefit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In a survey of members of the International Society of Refractive Surgery, 51% of respondents considered HIV-&#173;seropositive patients who did not have definite acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) to be acceptable refractive surgery candidates. Only 13% thought that patients with definite AIDS were candidates for refractive surgery, whereas 44% believed that the presence of AIDS was an absolute contraindication to refractive surgery. Some surgeons advise such patients against undergoing refractive surgery because of concerns about postoperative complications, including the increased risk of infection associated with immunosuppression. However, only 1&#160;case of keratitis (a bilateral infection with <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span>) following LASIK in an HIV-&#173;seropositive patient has been reported.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An additional concern is the potential for aerosolizing live virus during laser ablation, which could pose a risk to laser-&#173;suite personnel. Because refractive surgeons may operate on patients who do not know they are infected with viruses such as HIV or one of the hepatitis viruses, universal precautions must be followed with all patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In 1&#160;study, excimer laser ablation of a cornea infected with pseudorabies virus, a porcine-&#173;enveloped herpesvirus similar to HIV and HSV, did not appear capable of causing infection by transmission through the air. The authors concluded that excimer laser ablation of the cornea in a patient infected with HIV is unlikely to pose a health hazard to the surgeon or assistants. Another study demonstrated that, after excimer laser ablation of infected corneal stroma, polymerase chain reaction did not detect viable varicella virus (200&#160;nm in diameter) but did detect viable polio particles (70&#160;nm in diameter).</p>

Even if viral particles are not viable, the excimer laser plume produces particles with a mean diameter of 0.22&#160;µm. Although the health effects of inhaled particles from the plume have not yet been determined, there have been anecdotal reports of respiratory ailments such as chronic bronchitis in high-&#173;volume excimer laser refractive surgeons. Canister filter masks can exclude particles down to a diameter of 0.1&#160;µm and may be more protective than conventional surgical masks. In addition, evacuation of the laser plume potentially decreases the amount of breathable debris.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If a surgeon is considering performing excimer laser ablation in an HIV-&#173;infected patient who is not immunocompromised and has normal results on eye examination, extra precautions are warranted. The surgeon should counsel the patient about the visual risks of HIV infection and the lack of long-term follow-&#173;up results for refractive surgery in this population. The surgeon may also consider consulting with the physicians managing the patient’s underlying disease, including specialists in infectious diseases. The surgeon may choose to treat 1&#160;eye at a time on separate days and schedule the patient as the last patient of the day. In addition, the surgeon may consider implementing additional precautions for the operating room staff, such as wearing filter masks during the procedure and evacuating the laser plume.</p>

			<p class="h2">Diabetes Mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a prevalence of 12.3% for diabetes mellitus in US adults aged 20&#160;years and older—about 28.9&#160;million people. A patient with diabetes mellitus who is considering refractive surgery should have a thorough preoperative history and examination, and the surgeon should pay special attention to the presence of active diabetic ocular disease. The blood sugar of a diabetic patient must be well controlled at the time of examination to ensure an accurate refraction. A history of laser treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy or cystoid macular edema indicates visually significant diabetic complications that typically contraindicate refractive surgery. Ocular examination should include inspection of the corneal epithelium to check the health of the ocular surface, identification of cataract if present, and detailed retinal examination. Preoperative corneal sensation should be assessed because corneal anesthesia can impede epithelial healing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A retrospective review 6&#160;months after LASIK in 30&#160;eyes of patients with diabetes mellitus revealed a complication rate of 47%, compared with a complication rate of 6.9% in the control group. The most common problems in this study were related to epithelial healing and included epithelial loosening and defects. A loss of 2 or more lines of BCVA was reported in less than 1% of both the diabetes mellitus and control groups. However, 6 of the 30&#160;eyes in the diabetes mellitus group required a mean of 4.3&#160;months to heal because of persistent epithelial defects. The authors concluded that the high complication rate in these patients was explained by unmasking subclinical diabetic keratopathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another retrospective review of 24&#160;patients with diabetes mellitus who underwent LASIK demonstrated that 63% achieved UCVA of 20/25 or better. Three of the 24&#160;eyes had an epithelial defect after surgery, and epithelial ingrowth developed in 2 of these eyes. No eye lost BCVA. In contrast, Cobo-&#173;Soriano and colleagues evaluated 44&#160;diabetic patients (both insulin-&#173;dependent and non–insulin-&#173;dependent) who underwent LASIK in a retrospective, observational, case-&#173;controlled study and reported no significant difference in perioperative and postoperative complications, including epithelial defects, epithelial ingrowth, and flap complications between diabetic patients and control subjects.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In light of these contradictory reports, refractive surgeons should exercise caution in the selection of patients with diabetes mellitus for refractive surgery. Intraoperative technique should be adjusted to ensure maximal epithelial health. To reduce corneal toxicity, the surgeon should use the minimal amount of topical anesthetic (preferably in the form of nonpreserved drops) immediately before performing the procedure. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be counseled preoperatively about the increased risk of postoperative complications and the possibility of a prolonged healing time after LASIK. They should also be informed that the procedure treats only the refractive error and not the natural history of the diabetes mellitus, which can lead to future diabetic ocular complications and associated vision loss.</p>

			<p class="h2">Connective Tissue and Autoimmune Diseases</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most surgeons consider active, uncontrolled connective tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and polyarteritis nodosa, to be contraindications to refractive surgery. Reports in the literature have discussed corneal melting and perforation following cataract extraction in patients with these conditions, as well as corneal scarring after PRK in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, 2&#160;retrospective series suggest that refractive surgery may be considered in patients with well-&#173;controlled connective tissue or autoimmune disease. One retrospective study of 49&#160;eyes in 26&#160;patients with inactive or stable autoimmune disease who underwent LASIK revealed no postoperative corneal melting or persistent epithelial defects. Another retrospective study of 62&#160;eyes of patients with autoimmune or connective tissue disorders who had undergone LASIK revealed that these eyes had a somewhat worse refractive outcome than eyes of control subjects but did not sustain any severe complications such as corneal melting, laceration, or interface alterations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because the risk from an underlying disease cannot be quantified, increased caution should be exercised if refractive surgery is considered in patients with well-&#173;controlled autoimmune or connective tissue disease. It should be emphasized that the problems associated with autoimmune diseases may not present for many years, especially with significant ocular surface disease and dry eye. Consultation with the treating physician, unilateral surgery, and ancillary informed consent should be considered.</p>
