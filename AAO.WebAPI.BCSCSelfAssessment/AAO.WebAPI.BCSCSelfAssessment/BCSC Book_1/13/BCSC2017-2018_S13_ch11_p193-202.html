			<p class="chapter-title">Considerations After Refractive Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The number of patients who have had refractive surgery continues to grow, and ophthalmologists are increasingly confronted with the management of post–refractive surgery patients with other ocular conditions, such as cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment, corneal opacities, and irregular astigmatism. Calculation of the intraocular lens (IOL) power presents a particular challenge in this population.</p>
			<p class="h1">Intraocular Lens Calculations After Refractive Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although numerous formulas have been developed to calculate IOL power prior to cataract surgery for eyes that have undergone refractive surgery, these cases are still prone to refractive surprises. Currently, there is no infallible way to calculate IOL power for a patient who has undergone refractive surgery. Although the measurement of axial length should remain accurate after refractive surgery, determining the keratometric power of the post–refractive surgery cornea is problematic. The difficulty arises from several factors. Small, effective central optical zones after refractive surgery (especially after radial keratotomy [RK]) can lead to inaccurate measurements because keratometers and Placido disk–based corneal topography units measure the corneal curvature several millimeters away from the center of the cornea and possibly outside the modified treated zone. In addition, the relationship between the anterior and posterior corneal curvatures may be considerably altered after refractive surgery (especially after laser ablative procedures), leading to inaccurate results. Generally, if standard keratometry readings are used to calculate IOL power for a previously myopic, post–refractive surgery eye, the postoperative refractive error will be hyperopic, because the keratometry readings are erroneously steeper than the true central corneal power.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A variety of methods have been developed to better estimate the central corneal power after refractive surgery. None is perfectly accurate, and different methods can lead to disparate values. As many methods as possible should be used to calculate corneal power, and these estimates should be compared with each other, with standard keratometric readings, and with corneal topographic central power and simulated K&#160;readings.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Newer corneal topography and tomography systems not based on the Placido disk imaging claim to directly measure the central corneal curvature; such technology may make direct calculation of IOL power after refractive surgery more accurate. In addition, intraoperative wavefront aberrometer systems use Talbot-&#173;Moiré–based interferometry to obtain real-time aphakic IOL calculations—an approach that has been shown to increase accuracy and improve refractive outcomes in cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prior to cataract surgery, patients need to be informed that IOL power calculations are less accurate when performed after refractive surgery and that, despite maximum preoperative effort by the surgeon, additional surgery, such as surface ablation, laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), IOL exchange, or implantation of a piggyback IOL, may be required to attain a better refractive result if the patient is unwilling to consider corrective glasses or contact lenses to correct the refractive outcome. Cataract surgery done after RK frequently induces short-term corneal swelling with flattening and hyperopic shift. For this reason, in the event of a refractive “surprise,” an IOL exchange should not be performed in post-RK eyes until the cornea and refraction stabilize, which may take several weeks to months. Corneal curvature does not tend to change as much following cataract surgery performed after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) or LASIK; thus, it may be possible to plan and perform an IOL exchange or refractive surgical procedures earlier in these patients.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Eyes With Known Pre– and Post–Refractive Surgery Data</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">One method for calculating IOL power following refractive surgery is the <span class="italic">clinical history method,</span> in which pre–refractive surgery refraction and keratometry values, if available, combined with the current refraction and keratometry readings, are used to approximate the true post–refractive keratometry values for the central cornea. Unfortunately, even with these measurements, this approach has not been proven to be accurate. Despite this, pre–refractive surgery information should be kept by both the patient and the surgeon. To assist in retaining these data, the American Academy of Ophthalmology has developed the K-Card with its partner, the International Society of Refractive Surgery. The card is available in PDF form on the Academy website (<a href="http://www.aao.org/patient-safety-statement/kcard">www.aao.org/patient-safety-statement/kcard</a>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The key concept is to understand what changes occur on the corneal surface with refractive surgery. To use the historical method, the ophthalmologist should have the pre–refractive surgery refraction and keratometry readings, and the change in spherical equivalent can be calculated at the spectacle plane or, better yet, at the corneal plane. The post–refractive surgery refraction must be stable and obtained several months after the refractive surgery but before the onset of induced myopia from the developing nuclear sclerotic cataract. For example:</p>
			<p class="equation-first">Preoperative average keratometry: 44.00&#160;D</p>
			<p class="equation-mid">Preoperative spherical equivalent refraction (vertex distance 12&#160;mm): –8.00&#160;D</p>
			<p class="equation-mid">Preoperative refraction at the corneal plane: –8.00&#160;D/(1 – [0.012 <span class="math">×</span> –8.00&#160;D]) = –7.30&#160;D</p>
			<p class="equation-mid">Postoperative spherical equivalent refraction (vertex distance 12&#160;mm): –1.00&#160;D</p>
			<p class="equation-mid">Postoperative refraction at the corneal plane: –1.00&#160;D/(1&#160;– [0.012 <span class="math">×</span> –1.00&#160;D]) = –0.98&#160;D</p>
			<p class="equation-mid">Change in manifest refraction at the corneal plane: –7.30&#160;D – (–0.98&#160;D) = –6.32&#160;D</p>
			<p class="equation-last">Postoperative estimated keratometry: 44.00&#160;– 6.32&#160;D = 37.68&#160;D</p>
			<p class="h2">Eyes With No Preoperative Information</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When no preoperative information is available, the <span class="italic">hard contact lens method</span> can be used to calculate corneal power. This method is not very useful in clinical practice. The best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA; also called <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity, CDVA</span>) needs to be at least 20/80 for this approach to work. First, a baseline manifest refraction is performed and then a plano hard contact lens of known base curve (power) is placed on the eye, and another manifest refraction is performed. If the manifest refraction does not change, then the cornea has the same power as the contact lens. If the refraction is more myopic, the contact lens is steeper (more powerful) than the cornea by the amount of change in the refraction; the reverse holds true if the refraction is more hyperopic. For example:</p>
			<p class="equation-first">Current spherical equivalent manifest refraction: –1.00&#160;D</p>
			<p class="equation-mid">A hard contact lens of known base curve (8.7&#160;mm) and power (37.00&#160;D) is placed</p>
			<p class="equation-mid">Overrefraction: +2.00&#160;D</p>
			<p class="equation-mid">Change in refraction: +2.00&#160;D – (–1.00&#160;D) = +3.00&#160;D</p>
			<p class="equation-last ParaOverride-2">Calculation of corneal power: 37.00&#160;D + 3.00&#160;D = 40.00&#160;D</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">The ASCRS Online Post-Refractive Intraocular Lens Power Calculator</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A particularly useful resource for calculating IOL power in a post–refractive surgery patient has been developed by Warren Hill, MD; Li Wang, MD, PhD; and Douglas D. Koch, MD. It is available on the website of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) (www.ascrs.org) and directly at <a href="http://iolcalc.ascrs.org">http://iolcalc.ascrs.org</a>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To use this IOL calculator, the surgeon selects the appropriate prior refractive surgical procedure and enters the patient data, if known (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-1</span>). The IOL powers, calculated by a variety of formulas, are displayed at the bottom of the form, and the surgeon can compare the results to select the best IOL power for the individual situation. This spreadsheet is updated with new formulas and information as they become available and, at this time, probably represents the best option for calculation of IOL powers in post–refractive surgery patients.

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Retinal Detachment Repair After LASIK</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Even if the eyes of patients with high myopia become emmetropic as a result of refractive surgery, these patients need to be informed that their eyes remain at increased risk of retinal detachment. For this reason, symptoms such as floaters or photopsias warrant a thorough retinal evaluation with scleral depression to ensure that there are no peripheral retinal tears or holes. In addition, if vitreoretinal surgery or laser is deemed necessary, the vitreoretinal surgeon should ask about prior refractive surgery. Eyes undergoing retinal detachment repair after LASIK are prone to flap problems, including flap dehiscence, microstriae, and macrostriae. The surgeon may find it helpful to mark the edge of the flap prior to surgery to aid in flap replacement in case the flap is dislodged. The risk of flap problems increases dramatically if the epithelium is debrided during the retinal detachment repair. If flap dehiscence occurs, the flap should be carefully repositioned and the interface irrigated. A bandage contact lens may be placed at the end of the procedure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Postoperatively, the patient should be observed closely for signs of flap problems such as epithelial ingrowth and diffuse lamellar keratitis, especially if an epithelial defect was present on the flap. After retinal detachment repair, the intraocular pressure (IOP) needs to be monitored, especially when an intraocular gas bubble is used, keeping in mind that IOP measurements may read falsely low after refractive surgery because of corneal thinning. In addition, elevated IOP can cause a diffuse lamellar keratitis–like picture or even a fluid cleft between the flap and the stroma, resulting in a misleading, extremely low IOP measurement (see Chapter&#160;6). These problems are discussed in greater detail later in the chapter in the section Glaucoma After Refractive Surgery.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Corneal Transplantation After Refractive Surgery</p>
            <div id="Chapt11_Top3">
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal transplantation is occasionally required after refractive surgery. Reasons for needing a corneal graft after refractive surgery include significant corneal scarring, irregular astigmatism, corneal ectasia, and corneal edema. Issues unrelated to refractive surgery, such as trauma, infectious keratitis, or corneal edema after cataract surgery, can also necessitate corneal transplant surgery. Each type of refractive surgical procedure is unique in the reasons a graft may be required and in ways to avoid problems with the corneal transplant. Corneal transplantation techniques and indications are discussed in greater detail in BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span></p>
                <p class="body-text">After RK, a graft may be required because of trauma resulting in incisional rupture, central scarring not responsive to phototherapeutic keratectomy, irregular astigmatism, contact lens intolerance, or progressive hyperopia. The RK incisions can gape or dehisce during penetrating keratoplasty trephination, preventing creation of an even, uniform, and deep trephination. One method for avoiding RK wound gape or dehiscence during keratoplasty is to mark the cornea with the trephine and then reinforce the RK incisions with interrupted sutures outside the trephine mark prior to trephination. If the RK incisions open during the corneal transplant surgery, then X, mattress, or lasso sutures may be required to close these stellate wounds.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Corneal transplantation may also be required after excimer laser surface ablation. However, because of the 6- to 8-mm ablation zones typically used, the corneal periphery is generally not thinned, and transplantation in this situation is usually straightforward.</p>
                <p class="body-text">After LASIK, corneal transplantation may be required to treat central scarring (eg, after infection or with a buttonhole) or corneal ectasia. A significant challenge in this scenario is that most LASIK flaps are larger than a typical trephine size (8&#160;mm). Trephination through the flap increases the risk that the flap peripheral to the corneal transplant wound may separate. This complication may be avoidable through careful trephination and use of a gentle suture technique that incorporates the LASIK flap under the corneal transplant suture. Femtosecond laser trephination theoretically may decrease the risk of flap separation during trephination.</p>
                <p class="body-text">A few cases have been reported of inadvertent use of donor tissue that had undergone prior LASIK. The risk of this untoward event will increase as the donor pool includes more individuals who have undergone LASIK or surface ablation. Eye banks need to develop better methods to screen out such donor corneas. If a post-&#173;LASIK eye is inadvertently used for corneal transplantation, the patient should be informed. A regraft may be required to address significant anisometropia or irregular astigmatism.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Corneal transplantation is occasionally required in a patient with intrastromal corneal ring segments. The polymethyl methacrylate ring segments are typically placed near the edge of a standard corneal transplant, so the ring segments may be removed prior to grafting, or—because the ring segments lie within the central 7&#160;mm of the cornea—they may also be left in place and removed in toto with the host tissue or removed at the time of trephination.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Though rare, corneal transplantation after laser thermokeratoplasty or conductive keratoplasty may be required. Trephination should be straightforward in such cases, and the thermal scars should generally be incorporated into the corneal button. Even if the scars are not incorporated and remain peripheral to the new cornea, they should not significantly affect wound architecture, graft healing, or corneal curvature.</p>
               </div>
                 <p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Contact Lens Use After Refractive Surgery</p>
                <div id="Chapt11_Top4">
                    <p class="h2-h1">Indications</p>
                    <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Contact lenses can be used before and after refractive surgery. For example, a patient with presbyopia can use a temporary trial with soft contact lenses to experience monovision before undergoing surgery, thus reducing the risk of postoperative dissatisfaction. Contact lenses can also be used preoperatively in a patient with a motility abnormality (eg, esotropia or exotropia) to simulate expected vision after refractive surgery and to ensure that diplopia does not become manifest.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">In the perioperative period, hydrophilic soft contact lenses can help promote epithelial healing or prevent flap-&#173;related complications. Rigid gas-&#173;permeable (RGP) contact lenses are more effective than are soft lenses to correct reduced vision due to residual irregular astigmatism, and they can be a useful adjunct after RK and LASIK. Night-&#173;vision problems caused by a persistent, uncorrected refractive error or irregular astigmatism may also be reduced by using contact lenses. However, if the symptoms are related to higher-&#173;order aberrations, they may persist despite contact lens use.</p>
                    <p class="h2">General Principles</p>
                    <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Contact lenses for refractive purposes should not be fitted until surgical wounds and serial refractions are stable. The most practical approach to fitting an RGP lens after refractive surgery is to do a trial fitting with overrefraction.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">The clinician needs to discuss with the patient in understandable terms the challenges of contact lens fitting after refractive surgery and align the patient’s expectations with reality. A patient who successfully wore contact lenses before refractive surgery is more likely to be a successful contact lens wearer postoperatively than is one who never wore contact lenses.</p>
                    <p class="h2">Contact Lenses After Radial Keratotomy</p>
                    <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Centration is a challenge in fitting contact lenses after RK because the corneal apex is displaced to the midperiphery (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-2</span>). Frequently used fitting techniques involve referring to the preoperative keratometry readings and basing the initial lens trial on the average keratometry values. Contact lens stability is achieved by adjusting the lens diameter. In general, larger-&#173;diameter lenses take advantage of the eyelid to achieve stability. However, they also increase the effective steepness of the lens due to increased sagittal depth. If the preoperative keratometry reading is not available, the ophthalmologist can use a paracentral or midperipheral curve, as measured with postoperative corneal topography, as a starting point.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">When a successful fit cannot be obtained with a standard RGP lens, a reverse-&#173;geometry lens can be used. The secondary curves can be designed to be as steep as necessary to achieve a stable fit. The larger the optical zone, the flatter the fit.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">Hydrophilic soft lenses can also be used after RK. Toric soft lenses can be helpful when regular astigmatism is present. Soft lenses are less helpful in eyes with irregular astigmatism because they are less able to mask an irregular surface. Lens designs such as hybrid contacts, which consist of an RGP center surrounded by a soft contact lens skirt, and scleral RGP lenses, which vault the cornea and contact the perilimbal conjunctiva/sclera, may be helpful for patients with significant irregular astigmatism who are intolerant of conventional RGP lenses.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">Whenever contact lenses are prescribed for post-RK eyes, as in the preceding scenarios, the ophthalmologist should continue to monitor the cornea to check for neovascularization of the wounds. Should neovascularization occur, contact lens wear should cease. Once the vessels have regressed, refitting can commence.</p>
                    <p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Contact Lenses After Surface Ablation</p>
                    <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Immediately after surface ablation, a soft contact lens is placed on the cornea as a bandage to help promote epithelialization and reduce discomfort. The lens is worn until the corneal epithelium has healed. Healing time depends on the size of the epithelial defect but in general takes between 4 and 7&#160;days. A tight-&#173;fitting lens should be removed if there is evidence of corneal hypoxia (eg, corneal edema, folds in the Descemet membrane, or iritis).</p>
                    <p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Contact Lenses After LASIK</p>
                    <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The indications for contact lens fitting after LASIK are similar to those following other types of refractive surgery. The corneal contour is usually stable by 3&#160;months after LASIK for myopia; however, it may take up to 6&#160;months for the cornea to stabilize after LASIK for hyperopia.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">A soft contact lens may be used immediately after LASIK surgery to promote epithelialization and to prevent epithelial ingrowth. It is generally used for several days on an extended-&#173;wear basis and then removed by the surgeon. Daily-&#173;wear contact lenses for refractive purposes should not be considered until the surgeon believes the risk of flap displacement is low.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Glaucoma After Refractive Surgery</p>
                <div id="Chapt11_Top5">
                    <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The force required for applanation of a Goldmann tonometer is proportional to the central corneal thickness. As a result, an eye that has a thin central cornea may have an artifactually low IOP as measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT). Patients with normal-&#173;tension glaucoma have significantly thinner corneas than do patients with primary open-&#173;angle glaucoma. When a correction factor based on corneal thickness is applied, more than 30% of glaucoma patients demonstrate abnormally high IOP. The correction factor needed may be lower for measurements taken with the Tono-&#173;Pen (Reichert Technologies, Depew, NY) and the pneumotonometer.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">For IOP measured with GAT, an artifactual IOP reduction occurs following surface ablation and LASIK for myopia, both of which reduce central corneal thickness. Similar inaccuracies in IOP measurement can occur after surface ablation and LASIK for hyperopia. After excimer laser refractive surgery, the mean reduction in IOP measurement is 0.63&#160;mm&#160;Hg per diopter of correction, with a wide standard deviation. Postoperatively, some patients may demonstrate no change in IOP measurement, whereas others may exhibit an increase. In general, the reduction of measured IOP is greater after LASIK than after surface ablation. Surface ablation patients with a preoperative refractive error of less than 5.00&#160;D may have a negligible decrease in IOP measurements.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">Topical corticosteroids that are used after refractive surgery pose a serious risk of corticosteroid-&#173;induced IOP elevation, particularly because an accurate IOP measurement is difficult to obtain. By 3&#160;months postoperatively, up to 15% of surface ablation patients may have IOP above 22&#160;mm&#160;Hg. If the elevated IOP is not recognized early enough, optic nerve damage and visual field loss can occur.</p>
                    <p class="body-text">If topical corticosteroids are used postoperatively for an extended time, periodic, careful disc evaluation is essential. Optic nerve and nerve fiber layer imaging may facilitate the evaluation. Periodic visual field assessment may be more effective than IOP measurement for identifying at-risk patients before severe visual field loss occurs (see Chapter&#160;10, Fig&#160;10-4).</p>
                    <p class="body-text">Refractive surgery patients who develop glaucoma are initially treated with IOP-&#173;lowering medications, and their IOP is carefully measured. If medication or laser treatment does not adequately reduce the IOP, glaucoma surgery may be recommended. Patients who have had refractive surgery should be warned prior to glaucoma surgery of the potential for transient vision loss from inflammation, hypotony, or change in refractive error. The glaucoma surgeon should be made aware of the patient’s previous LASIK in order to avoid trauma to the corneal flap.

The surgeon enters the patient’s pre–refractive surgery data (if known) and the current data into the data form. After the “calculate” button at the bottom of the form is clicked, the IOL power calculated by a variety of formulas is displayed. (Note: In this illustration, accessed January 19, 2017, the “calculate” button was activated with no patient data entered so as to show the final appearance of the screen; the form itself is updated periodically and available at http://iolcalc.ascrs.org.) <span class="figure-source-note">(Used with permission from the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery.)</span></p>
