			<p class="chapter-title">Patient Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The preoperative patient evaluation is perhaps the most critical component in achieving successful outcomes after refractive surgery. It is during this encounter that the surgeon develops an impression as to whether the patient is a good candidate for refractive surgery. Perhaps the most important goal of this evaluation, however, is to identify who should <span class="italic">not</span> have refractive surgery.</p>
			<p class="h1">Patient History</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The evaluation actually begins before the physician sees the patient. Technicians or refractive surgical coordinators who interact with a patient may get a sense of the patient’s goals and expectations for refractive surgery. If the patient is particularly quarrelsome about the time or date of the appointment or argues about cost, the surgeon should be informed. Such a patient may not be a good candidate for surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Important parts of the preoperative refractive surgery evaluation include an assessment of the patient’s expectations; the social, medical, and ocular history; manifest and cycloplegic refractions; a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including slit-lamp and fundus examinations; and ancillary testing (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;2-1</span>). If the patient is a good candidate for surgery, the surgeon should discuss the benefits, risks, and alternatives with the patient as part of the informed consent process. (See “Discussion of Findings and Informed Consent” later in this chapter.)</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because accurate test results are crucial to the success of refractive surgery, the refractive surgeon must closely supervise office staff members who are performing the various tests (eg, corneal topography or pachymetry) during the preoperative evaluation. Likewise, the surgeon should make sure the instruments used in the evaluation are properly calibrated, as miscalibrated instruments can result in faulty data and poor surgical results.</p>
			<p class="h2">Patient Expectations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">One of the most important aspects of the entire evaluation is assessing the patient’s expectations. Inappropriate patient expectations are probably the leading cause of patient dissatisfaction after refractive surgery. The results may be exactly what the surgeon expected, but if those expectations were not conveyed adequately to the patient before surgery, the patient may be disappointed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgeon should explore expectations relating to both the refractive result (eg, uncorrected visual acuity [UCVA; also called <span class="italic">uncorrected distance visual acuity, UDVA</span>]) and the emotional result (eg, improved self-&#173;esteem). Patients need to understand that they should not expect refractive surgery to improve their best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA; also called <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity, CDVA</span>). In addition, they need to realize that refractive surgery will not alter the course of eventual presbyopia, nor will it prevent potential future ocular problems such as cataract, glaucoma, or retinal detachment. If the patient has clearly unrealistic goals, such as a guarantee of 20/20 uncorrected visual acuity or perfect uncorrected reading <span class="italic">and</span> distance vision, even though he or she has presbyopia, the patient may need to be told that refractive surgery cannot currently fulfill his or her needs. The refractive surgeon should exclude such patients.</p>
			<p class="h2">Social History</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An accurate social and occupational history can uncover specific vision requirements of the patient’s profession. Certain occupations require that best vision be at a specific distance. For example, to avoid wearing glasses at the pulpit, a minister may desire that best uncorrected vision be at arm’s length. Military personnel, firefighters, or police officers may have restrictions on minimum UCVA and BCVA and on the type of refractive surgery allowed. Knowledge of a patient’s recreational activities may help guide the surgeon to the most appropriate refractive procedure or determine whether that patient is even a good candidate for refractive surgery. For example, a surface laser procedure may be preferable to a lamellar procedure for a patient who is active and at high risk of ocular trauma. Someone with highly myopic and presbyopic vision who is used to examining objects a few inches from the eyes without the use of glasses (eg, jeweler or stamp collector) may be dissatisfied with postoperative emmetropia. Tobacco and alcohol use should be documented.</p>
			<p class="h2">Medical History</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The medical history should include systemic conditions, prior surgical procedures, and current and prior medications. Certain systemic conditions, such as connective tissue disorders and diabetes mellitus, can lead to poor healing after refractive surgery. An immunocompromised state—for example, from cancer or human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome—may increase the risk of infection after refractive surgery (see Chapter&#160;10). Medications that affect healing or the ability to fight infection, such as systemic corticosteroids or chemotherapeutic drugs, should be specifically noted. The use of corticosteroids increases the risk of cataract development, which could compromise the long-term postoperative visual outcome. Use of certain medications—for example, isotretinoin and amiodarone—traditionally has been thought to increase the risk of poor results with photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) due to a potentially increased risk of poor corneal healing; however, there is no evidence for this association in the peer-&#173;reviewed literature. Previous use of isotretinoin can damage the meibomian glands and predispose a patient to dry-eye symptoms postoperatively. Because of a possible increased risk of delayed epithelial healing, caution needs to be taken with patients using sumatriptan who are undergoing PRK or LASIK and with patients using hormone replacement therapy or antihistamines who are undergoing PRK.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although laser manufacturers do not recommend excimer laser surgery for patients with cardiac pacemakers and implanted defibrillators, many such patients have undergone the surgery without problems. It may be best to check with the pacemaker and defibrillator manufacturer before laser surgery. Refractive surgery is also generally contraindicated in pregnant and breastfeeding women because of possible changes in refraction and corneal hydration status. Many surgeons recommend waiting at least 3&#160;months after delivery and cessation of breastfeeding before performing the refractive surgery evaluation and procedure.</p>

			<p class="h2">Pertinent Ocular History</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ocular history should focus on previous and current eye problems, such as dry-eye symptoms, blepharitis, recurrent erosions, glaucoma, and retinal tears or detachments. In addition, potentially recurrent conditions, such as ocular herpes simplex virus infection, should be recognized so that preventive measures can be instituted. Ocular medications should be noted. Prior ocular surgical procedures, such as radial keratotomy or penetrating keratoplasty, may affect clinical decision making in refractive surgery. A personal or family history of keratoconus may eliminate a patient from refractive surgery consideration. A history of previous methods of optical correction, such as glasses and contact lenses, should be taken. The stability of the current refraction is a very important consideration. A significant change in prescription for glasses or contact lenses is generally thought to be greater than 0.50&#160;D in either sphere or cylinder within the past year. A contact lens history should be taken. Information gathered should include the type of lenses used (eg, soft, rigid gas-&#173;permeable [RGP], polymethyl methacrylate [PMMA]); the wearing schedule (eg, daily-&#173;wear disposable, daily-&#173;wear frequent replacement, overnight wear indicating number of nights worn in a row); the type of cleaning and disinfecting agents used; and the age of the lenses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because contact lens wear can change the shape of the cornea (corneal warpage), it is recommended that patients discontinue contact lens wear before the refractive surgery evaluation as well as before the surgery. The exact length of time the patient should be without contact lens wear has not been established. Current clinical practice typically involves discontinuation of soft contact lenses for at least 3&#160;days to 2&#160;weeks (toric lenses may require longer) and of rigid contact lenses for at least 2–3&#160;weeks, but it may take months for the corneal curvature to return to normal in some long-term rigid contact lens wearers. For this reason, some surgeons keep patients out of rigid contact lenses for 1&#160;month for every decade of contact lens wear. Before being considered for refractive surgery, patients with irregular or unstable corneas should discontinue wearing their contact lenses for a longer period and then be reevaluated every few weeks until the refraction and corneal topography stabilize. For patients who wear RGP contact lenses and find glasses a hardship, some surgeons suggest changing to soft contact lenses for a period to aid stabilization and regularization of the corneal curvature.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Patient Age, Presbyopia, and Monovision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The age of a patient is a consideration in predicting postoperative patient satisfaction. The loss of near vision with aging should be discussed with all patients. Before 40&#160;years of age, individuals with emmetropia generally do not require reading adds to see a near target. After this age, patients need to understand that if their eyes are made emmetropic through refractive surgery, they will require reading glasses for near vision. They must also understand that “near vision” tasks include all tasks performed up close, such as applying makeup, shaving, or seeing the computer or cell phone screen—not just “reading.” These points cannot be overemphasized for patients with myopia who are approaching 40&#160;years of age. Before refractive surgery, these patients can read well with and without their glasses. Some may even read well with their contact lenses. If their eyes are made emmetropic after surgery, many will not read well without reading glasses. The patient needs to understand this phenomenon and must be willing to accept this result before undergoing any refractive surgery that aims for emmetropia. In patients who wear glasses, a trial with contact lenses will simulate vision following refractive surgery, and approximate the patient’s reading ability after surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A discussion of monovision (ie, 1&#160;eye corrected for distance and the other eye for near/intermediate vision) often fits well into the evaluation at this point. The alternative of monovision correction should be discussed with all patients in the age groups approaching or affected by presbyopia. Many patients have successfully used monovision in contact lenses and want it after refractive surgery. Others have never tried it but would like to, and still others have no interest. If a patient has not used monovision before but is interested, the attempted surgical result should first be demonstrated with glasses or temporary contact lenses at near and distance. Generally, the dominant eye is corrected for distance, and the nondominant eye is corrected to approximately –1.50 to –1.75&#160;D. For most patients, such refraction allows good uncorrected distance and near vision without intolerable anisometropia. Some surgeons prefer a “mini-&#173;monovision” procedure, whereby the near-&#173;vision eye is corrected to approximately –0.75&#160;D, which allows some near vision with better distance vision and less anisometropia. The exact amount of monovision depends on the desires of the patient. Higher amounts of monovision (up to –2.50&#160;D) can be used successfully in selected patients who want excellent postoperative near vision. However, in some patients with a higher degree of postoperative myopia, improving near vision may lead to unwanted adverse effects of loss of depth perception and anisometropia. It is advisable to have a patient simulate monovision with contact lenses before surgery (generally about 5&#160;days to 1&#160;week, but practices are variable) to ensure that distance and near vision, as well as stereovision, are acceptable and that no muscle imbalance is present, especially with higher degrees of monovision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although typically the nondominant eye is corrected for near, some patients prefer that the dominant eye be corrected for near. Of several methods for testing ocular dominance, one of the simplest is to have the patient point to a distant object, such as a small letter on an eye chart. Alternatively, the patient can make an “okay sign” with 1&#160;hand and look at the examiner through the opening, and then close each eye to determine which eye he or she was using when pointing; this is the dominant eye.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Examination</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Uncorrected Visual Acuity and Manifest and Cycloplegic Refraction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The refractive elements of the preoperative examination are extremely critical because they directly determine the amount of surgery to be performed. Visual acuity at distance and near should be measured. The current glasses prescription and visual acuity with those glasses should also be determined, and a manifest refraction should be performed. The sharpest visual acuity with the least amount of minus (“pushing plus”) should be the final endpoint (see BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics</span>). The duochrome test should not be used as the final endpoint because it tends to overminus patients. Document the best visual acuity obtainable, even if it is better than 20/20. An automated refraction with an autorefractor or wavefront aberrometer may be helpful in providing a starting point for the manifest refraction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A cycloplegic refraction is also necessary. Sufficient waiting time must be allowed between the time the patient’s eyes are dilated with cycloplegic eye drops and measurement of the refraction. Tropicamide, 1%, or cyclopentolate, 1%, are the most commonly used cycloplegic drops. For full cycloplegia, waiting at least 30&#160;minutes (with tropicamide, 1%) or 60&#160;minutes (with cyclopentolate, 1%) is recommended. The cycloplegic refraction should refine the sphere and not the cylinder from the manifest refraction, as it is done to neutralize accommodation. For eyes with greater than 5.00&#160;D of refractive error, a vertex distance measurement should be performed to obtain the most accurate refraction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When the difference between the manifest and cycloplegic refractions is large (eg, &gt;0.50&#160;D), a postcycloplegic manifest refraction may be helpful to recheck the original. In patients with myopia, such a large difference is often caused by an overminused manifest refraction. In patients with hyperopia, substantial latent hyperopia may be present, in which case the surgeon and patient need to decide exactly how much hyperopia to treat. If there is significant latent hyperopia, a pushed-plus spectacle or contact lens correction can be worn for several weeks or months preoperatively to reduce the postoperative adjustment that may result from treating the true refraction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Refractive surgeons have their own preferences for whether to program the laser using the manifest or cycloplegic refraction, based on their individual nomogram and technique and on the patient’s age. Many surgeons plan their laser input according to the manifest refraction, especially for younger patients, if that refraction has been performed with a careful pushed-plus technique.</p>
			<p class="h2">Pupillary Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After the manifest refraction (but before dilating eye drops are administered), the external and anterior segment examinations are performed. Specific attention should be given to the pupillary examination. The pupil size should be evaluated in bright room light and under dim illumination, and the surgeon should look for an afferent pupillary defect. Various techniques are available for measuring pupil size in dim illumination, including use of a near card with pupil sizes on the edge (with the patient fixating at distance), or a pupillometer. The dim-light measurement should be taken using an amount of light entering the eye that closely approximates the amount entering during normal nighttime activities, such as night driving; it should not necessarily be done under completely dark conditions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pupil measurements should be standardized as much as possible. Measuring the low-light pupil diameter preoperatively and using that measurement to direct surgery remains a controversial approach. Conventional wisdom suggests that the optical zone should be larger than the pupil diameter to minimize vision disturbances such as glare and halos. Recent evidence, however, does not support an association between preoperative pupil size and an increased incidence of either glare or halo concerns 1&#160;year postoperatively. It is not clear, therefore, that pupil size can be used to predict which patients are more likely to have such symptoms. However, a thorough and documented discussion with the patient is required. The size of the effective optical zone—which is related to the ablation profile and the level of refractive error—may be more important in minimizing visual adverse effects than is the low-light pupil diameter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When asked, patients often note that they had glare under dim-light conditions even before undergoing refractive surgery. Thus, it is helpful for patients to become aware of their glare and halo symptoms preoperatively, as this knowledge may minimize postoperative concerns or misunderstanding.</p>

			<p class="h2">Ocular Motility, Confrontation Fields, and Ocular Anatomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular motility should be carefully evaluated prior to surgery. In patients with asymptomatic tropia or phoria, symptoms may develop after refractive surgery if the change in refraction causes the motility status to break down. If there is a history of strabismus (see Chapter&#160;10) or a concern about ocular alignment postoperatively, a trial with contact lenses before surgery should be considered. A sensory motor evaluation can be obtained preoperatively if strabismus is an issue. Confrontation field tests should be performed as part of the basic ophthalmic examination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The general anatomy of the orbits should also be assessed. Patients with small palpebral fissures and/or large brows may not be ideal candidates for LASIK because there may be inadequate exposure and difficulty in achieving suction with the microkeratome or femtosecond laser suction ring.</p>
			<p class="h2">Intraocular Pressure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The intraocular pressure (IOP) should be checked after the manifest refraction is completed and corneal topography measurements are taken. Patients with glaucoma (see Chapter&#160;10) should be advised that during certain refractive surgery procedures, the IOP is dramatically elevated, potentially aggravating optic nerve damage. Also, topical corticosteroids are used after most refractive surgery procedures and, after a surface ablation procedure, may be used for months. Long-term use of topical corticosteroids may cause marked elevation of IOP in corticosteroid responders.</p>

			<p class="h2">Slit-Lamp Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A complete slit-lamp examination of the eyelids and anterior segment should be performed. The conjunctiva should be examined specifically for scarring, conjunctivochalasis, or chemosis, which may cause problems with microkeratome suction. The cornea should be evaluated for surface abnormalities such as decreased tear breakup time (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-1</span>) and punctate epithelial erosions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-2</span>). Significant blepharitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-3</span>), meibomitis, and dry-eye syndrome should be addressed before refractive surgery, as they are associated with increased postoperative discomfort and decreased vision, and dry-eye symptoms frequently increase postoperatively. A careful examination for epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-4</span>) is required, because its presence increases the risk of flap complications during LASIK. Patients with epithelial basement membrane dystrophy are not ideal candidates for LASIK and may be better candidates for surface ablation, because removal of the abnormal epithelium may be palliative. Signs of keratoconus, such as corneal thinning and steepening, may also be found. Keratoconus is typically a contraindication to incisional or ablative refractive surgery (see Chapter&#160;10). The endothelium should be examined carefully for signs of cornea guttata and other dystrophies. Poor visual results have been reported in patients with cornea guttata and a family history of Fuchs dystrophy. Corneal edema is generally considered a contraindication to refractive surgery. The deposits of granular and Avellino corneal dystrophies may increase substantially in size and number in the flap interface after LASIK, resulting in poor vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The anterior chamber, iris, and crystalline lens should also be examined. A shallow anterior chamber depth may be a contraindication for insertion of certain phakic intraocular lenses (PIOLs) (see Chapter&#160;8). Careful evaluation of the crystalline lens for clarity is essential in both the undilated and dilated state, especially in patients more than 50&#160;years of age. Surgeons should be wary of progressive myopia due to nuclear sclerosis. Patients with mild lens changes that are visually insignificant should be informed of these findings and advised that the changes may become more significant in the future, independent of refractive surgery. They should also be told that IOL power calculations may be less accurate when performed after keratorefractive surgery. In patients with moderate lens opacities, cataract extraction may be the best form of refractive surgery.</p>

			<p class="h2">Dilated Fundus Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A dilated fundus examination before refractive surgery is made to ensure that the posterior segment is normal. Special attention should be given to the macula, optic nerve (glaucoma, optic nerve drusen), and peripheral retina (retinal breaks, detachment). Patients and surgeons should realize that highly myopic eyes are naturally at increased risk of retinal detachment (see Chapter&#160;10), unrelated to refractive surgery. The patient should be evaluated by a retinal specialist if any concerning retinal pathology is discovered.</p>

			<div id="Chapt2_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Corneal Topography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The corneal curvature must be evaluated. Although manual keratometry readings can be quite informative, they have largely been replaced by computerized corneal topographic analyses. Several different methods are available to analyze the corneal curvature, including Placido disk-based topography, scanning slit-beam imaging, rotating Scheimpflug photography, high-&#173;frequency ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques. (See also the discussion of corneal topography in Chapter&#160;1.) These techniques image the cornea and provide color maps showing corneal power and/or elevation. Patients with visually significant irregular astigmatism are generally not good candidates for corneal refractive surgery. Early keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-5</span>), and contact lens warpage are potential causes of visually significant irregular astigmatism. Irregular astigmatism secondary to contact lens warpage usually reverses over time, although the reversal may take months. Serial corneal topographic studies should be performed to document the resolution of visually significant irregular astigmatism before any refractive surgery is undertaken.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Unusually steep or unusually flat corneas can increase the risk of poor flap creation with the microkeratome. Femtosecond laser flap creation theoretically may avoid these risks. When keratometric or corneal topographic measurements reveal an amount or an axis of astigmatism that differs significantly from that determined through refraction, the refraction should be rechecked for accuracy. Lenticular astigmatism or posterior corneal curvature may account for the difference between refractive and keratometric or topographic astigmatism. Most surgeons will treat the amount and axis of the refractive astigmatism, as long as the patient understands that after any future cataract surgery, some astigmatism may reappear (after the astigmatism contributed by the natural lens has been eliminated).</p>
			<p class="h2">Pachymetry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal thickness is an important criterion for determining adequacy for keratorefractive surgery. Corneal pachymetry is usually measured with ultrasound; however, certain non–Placido disk corneal topography and OCT systems can also be used if properly calibrated. Some systems provide a map showing the relative thickness of the cornea at various locations. The accuracy of the pachymetry measurements of scanning-&#173;slit systems decreases markedly for eyes that have undergone keratorefractive surgery. Because the thinnest part of the cornea is typically located centrally, a central measurement should always be taken. The thickness of the cornea is an important factor in determining whether the patient is a candidate for refractive surgery and identifying the optimal refractive procedure. In a study of 896&#160;eyes undergoing LASIK, the mean central corneal thickness was 550&#160;µm&#160;± 33&#160;µm (range, 472–651&#160;µm). It has been suggested that an unusually thin cornea (beyond 2&#160;standard deviations) indicates that the patient may not be ideal for any refractive surgery. Many surgeons would not consider LASIK refractive surgery if the central corneal thickness is less than 480&#160;µm, even if the calculated residual stromal bed (RSB) is thicker than 250&#160;µm. If LASIK is performed and results in a relatively thin RSB—for example, around 250&#160;µm—future enhancement surgery that further thins the stromal bed may not be possible. If there is suspicion that endothelial integrity is causing an abnormally thick cornea, specular microscopy may be helpful in assessing the health of the endothelium.</p>

			<p class="h2">Wavefront Analysis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Wavefront analysis is a technique that can provide an objective refraction measurement (see also discussion of this topic in Chapters&#160;1 and&#160;5). Certain excimer lasers can use this wavefront analysis information directly to guide the ablation, a procedure called <span class="italic">wavefront-&#173;guided,</span> or <span class="italic">custom, ablation.</span> Some surgeons use wavefront analysis to document levels of preoperative higher-&#173;order aberrations. Refraction data from the wavefront analysis unit can also be used to refine the manifest refraction. If the manifest refraction and the wavefront analysis refraction are very dissimilar, the patient may not be a good candidate for wavefront treatment. Note that a custom wavefront ablation generally removes more tissue than does a standard ablation in the same eye.</p>
			<p class="h2">Calculation of Residual Stromal Bed Thickness After LASIK</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A lamellar laser refractive procedure such as LASIK involves creation of a corneal flap, ablation of the stromal bed, and replacement of the flap. The strength and integrity of the cornea postoperatively depend greatly on the thickness of the RSB. Thickness of the RSB is calculated by subtracting the sum of the flap thickness and the calculated laser ablation depth from the preoperative corneal thickness. For example, if the central corneal thickness is 550&#160;µm, the flap thickness is estimated to be 140&#160;µm, and the ablation depth for the patient’s refraction is 50&#160;µm, the RSB would be 550&#160;µm&#160;– (140&#160;µm + 50&#160;µm) = 360&#160;µm. When the surgeon determines the RSB, the amount of tissue removed should be based on the actual intended refractive correction, not on the nomogram-&#173;adjusted number entered into the laser computer. For example, if a patient with –10.00&#160;D myopia that is being fully corrected, the amount of tissue removed is 128&#160;µm for a 6.5-mm ablation zone for a broad-beam laser. Even if the surgeon usually takes off 15% of the refraction for a conventional ablation and enters that number into the laser computer, approximately 128&#160;µm of tissue will be removed, not 85% of 128&#160;µm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most surgeons believe the RSB should be at least 250&#160;µm. Others want the RSB to be greater than 50% of the original corneal thickness. If the calculation reveals a thinner RSB than desired, LASIK may not be the best surgical option. In these cases, a surface ablation procedure may be a better option, as this will result in a thicker RSB postoperatively.</p>

			<p class="h1">Discussion of Findings and Informed Consent</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After completing the evaluation, the surgeon must analyze the information and discuss the findings with the patient. If the patient is a candidate for refractive surgery, the discussion must include the risks and benefits of the medical and surgical alternatives. (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;2-2</span> provides an overview of the most common refractive surgery procedures, their typical refractive ranges, and their key limitations.) Significant aspects of this discussion are the expected visual acuity results for the amount of refractive error (including the need for distance and/or reading glasses, the chance of needing an enhancement, and whether maximal surgery is being performed during the initial procedure), the risk of decreased BCVA or severe vision loss, the adverse effects of glare and halos or dry eyes, the change in vision quality, and the rare need to revise a corneal flap (eg, for flap displacement, significant striae, or epithelial ingrowth). The patient should understand that the laser ablation may be aborted if there is an incomplete, decentered, or buttonholed flap. The pros and cons of surgery on 1&#160;eye versus both eyes on the same day should also be discussed, and patients should be allowed to decide which is best for them. Although the consequences of bilateral infection are higher with bilateral surgery, serial unilateral surgery may result in temporary anisometropia and is more inconvenient. Nonsurgical alternatives, such as glasses and contact lenses, should also be discussed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If a patient is considering refractive surgery, he or she should be given the informed consent document to take home and review. The patient should be given an opportunity to discuss any questions related to the surgery or the informed consent form with the surgeon preoperatively. The consent form should be signed before surgery and never when the patient is dilated and/or sedated. For sample informed consent forms, see the website of the Ophthalmic Mutual Insurance Company (OMIC; <a href="http://www.omic.com/risk-management/consent-forms/">www.omic.com<br />/risk-management/consent-forms/</a>).</p>
