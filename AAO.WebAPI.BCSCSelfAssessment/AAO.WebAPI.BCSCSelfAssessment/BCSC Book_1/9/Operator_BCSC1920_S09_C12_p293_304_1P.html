			<p class="body-text">Endophthalmitis is a clinical diagnosis made when intraocular inflammation involving both the posterior and anterior chambers is attributable to bacterial or fungal infection. The ret&#173;ina or the choroid may be involved; occasionally &#173;there is concomitant infectious scleritis or keratitis. Acute postoperative and posttraumatic endophthalmitis are covered in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous,</span> and are not discussed &#173;here. Chronic postoperative (infectious) endophthalmitis occurs weeks or months &#173;after surgery (usually cataract extraction) and can be caused by a myriad of bacteria and fungi. Endogenous endophthalmitis occurs when bacteria or fungi are hematogenously disseminated into the ocular circulation. “Sterile endophthalmitis” describes cases in which infection is suspected but that return negative culture results.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Chronic Postoperative Endophthalmitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chronic postoperative endophthalmitis has a distinctive clinical course, with multiple recurrences of chronic indolent inflammation in an eye that had previously under&#173;gone surgery, typically cataract extraction. Chronic anterior segment inflammation, hypopyon, keratic precipitates, intracapsular plaques, and/or vitritis may be pres&#173;ent. Inflammation may respond to corticosteroid therapy but often recurs &#173;after ste&#173;roids are tapered. This recurrent indolent inflammation may occur at any point during the postoperative course, but it is often delayed by many months to years. Inflammation may cause corneal decompensation or even iris neovascularization in the most severe cases. This course is quite dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from the explosive onset of acute postoperative endophthalmitis. The incidence of acute postoperative endophthalmitis varies between 0.07% and 0.1%. The incidence of chronic endophthalmitis, however, has not been well established, as the condition may often go undiagnosed. Chronic postoperative endophthalmitis can be divided into bacterial and fungal va&#173;ri&#173;e&#173;ties.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chronic postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis is most commonly caused by <span class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes.</span> Additionally, gram-&#173;positive bacteria with limited virulence (eg, <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> and <span class="italic">Corynebacterium</span> species), gram-&#173;negative bacteria, or<span class="italic"> Mycobacterium</span> species may also cause similar chronic infection. <span class="italic">P acnes,</span> a commensal, anaerobic, gram-&#173;positive, pleomorphic rod, is commonly found on the eyelid skin or on the conjunctiva. <span class="italic">P&#160;acnes</span> may sequester itself between an IOL implant and the posterior capsule. In this relatively anaerobic environment, the organism grows and forms colonies, which manifest as whitish plaques between the posterior capsule and the IOL implant (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-1</span>). A Nd:YAG capsulotomy can trigger chronic endophthalmitis by liberating the organism into the vitreous cavity, resulting in a more severe vitreous inflammation and an exacerbation of the under&#173;lying infection.</p>

			<p class="h2">Clinical Findings</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chronic postoperative fungal endophthalmitis may pres&#173;ent in a very similar fashion to that caused by <span class="italic">P acnes</span>. Numerous fungal organisms have been implicated in this chronic inflammatory pro&#173;cess, including <span class="italic">Candida parapsilosis</span>, <span class="italic">Aspergillus flavus, Torulopsis can</span><span class="italic">dida,</span> and <span class="italic">Paecilomyces lilacinus,</span> as well as <span class="italic">Verticillium</span> species. Certain clinical signs may be helpful in differentiating a fungal from a bacterial etiology, including the presence of corneal infiltrate or edema, mass in the iris or ciliary body, or development of necrotizing scleritis. The presence of vitreous “snowballs” with a “string-&#173;of-&#173;pearls” appearance in the vitreous may also be indicative of a fungal infection. The intraocular inflammation may worsen &#173;after topical, periocular, or intraocular ste&#173;roid therapy, which should automatically raise the suspicion of infection.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diagnosis of chronic postoperative endophthalmitis is confirmed by obtaining aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal cultures of the aqueous, capsular plaques (if pres&#173;ent), and vitreous at the time of pars plana vitrectomy. Gram and fungal stains of undiluted specimens, capsular plaques, and vitreous snowballs should also be obtained. The value of such stains should not be underestimated, especially in cases of fungal endophthalmitis. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of primers for <span class="italic">P acnes</span> or pan-&#173;fungal and pan-&#173;bacterial primers are helpful if available. The bacterial and fungal stains or PCR may yield immediate information, enabling the clinician to tailor therapy and improve clinical prognosis long before the results of the cultures turn positive. &#173;Because of the slow-&#173;growing and fastidious nature of the organisms that cause chronic endophthalmitis, cultures must be retained by the microbiology laboratory for 2 or more weeks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of chronic postoperative endophthalmitis includes noninfectious &#173;causes such as lens-&#173;induced uveitis from retained cortical material or retained intravitreal lens fragments, intraocular inflammation from iris chafing resulting from IOL malposition, uveitis-&#173;glaucoma-&#173;hyphema syndrome, and intraocular lymphoma masquerade syndrome.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pars plana vitrectomy and injection of intravitreal and endocapsular vancomycin are therapeutic in many cases of chronic postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis. However, this treatment may not completely eradicate the infection, especially if equatorial lens capsule sequestrae of bacteria are pres&#173;ent. In such cases, IOL explantation, complete capsulectomy, and intravitreal vancomycin injection is curative. The decision to explant the IOL is made on a case-&#173;by-&#173;case basis and is based on the clinical course, the severity of the intraocular inflammation, and the level of vision loss. &#173;There is no preferred method for treating this condition, but existing lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture suggests that more than one surgery may be necessary to eradicate this chronic infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The treatment of chronic fungal endophthalmitis is more difficult and requires the use of weekly intravitreal antifungal injections (amphotericin or voriconazole) and, possibly, systemic antifungal drugs in the most severe cases. In vitrectomized eyes, antifungals are often injected twice a week. Multiple vitrectomies may be necessary. The role of systemic therapy in this chronic form of fungal endophthalmitis is not well established or proven.</p>

			<p class="h1">Endogenous Endophthalmitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Endogenous Bacterial Endophthalmitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is caused by hematogenous dissemination of bacterial organisms, resulting in intraocular infection. This entity is uncommon and accounts for less than 10% of all forms of endophthalmitis. Patients who have compromised immune systems are most at risk for endogenous endophthalmitis. Predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus, systemic malignancy, sickle cell anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and HIV infection. Extensive gastrointestinal surgery, endoscopy, dental procedures, and intravenous drug abuse may all increase the risk of endogenous endophthalmitis. Systemic immunomodulatory therapy and chemotherapy may also put patients at risk. Although the eye may be the only location where the infection can be found, &#173;there may be an extraocular focus in as many as 90% of cases. Pos&#173;si&#173;ble sources of infection to be considered are tooth abscess, pneumonia, endocarditis, urinary tract infection, bacterial meningitis, and liver abscess. &#173;There may be a history of an indwelling line or port.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A wide variety of bacteria can cause endogenous endophthalmitis. The most common gram-&#173;positive organisms are <span class="italic">Streptococcus</span> species (endocarditis), <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (cutaneous infections), <span class="italic">Bacillus</span> species (from intravenous drug use), and <span class="italic">Nocardia</span> species (in immunocompromised patients; discussed in further detail in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>). The most common gram-&#173;negative organisms are <span class="italic">Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae,</span> and enteric organisms such as <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> and <span class="italic">Klebsiella</span> species. In Asia, infection from <span class="italic">Kleb</span><span class="italic">siella</span> species in liver abscesses is the most common cause of endogenous endophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-7">Jackson TL, Paraskevopoulos T, Georgalas&#160;I. Systematic review of 342 cases of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis. <span class="reference--journal-_italic">Surv Ophthalmol.</span> 2014;59(6):627–635.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical findings and symptoms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinical features of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis are suggestive of an ongoing systemic infection and may include fever greater than 101.5°F, elevated peripheral leukocyte count, and positive bacterial cultures from extraocular sites (blood, urine, sputum). Patients may be ill and undergoing treatment for a primary under&#173;lying disease when they pres&#173;ent with endogenous endophthalmitis. However, some patients may be ambulatory and afebrile. The under&#173;lying disease may include cancer treated with prolonged intravenous chemotherapy as well as other chronic infections, which may subsequently sequester in the eye. A nonocular infection serving as a nidus for bacterial dissemination to the eye may be very difficult to diagnose, especially in cases of osteomyelitis, sinusitis, or pneumonia misdiagnosed as a &#173;simple upper respiratory tract infection. In &#173;these situations, laboratory tests cannot substitute for a detailed history and review of systems.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinical symptoms include acute onset of pain, photophobia, and blurred vision. Examination usually reveals severely reduced visual acuity, and fibrin in the anterior chamber; hypopyon may be pres&#173;ent; very rarely &#173;there may be periorbital and eyelid edema. &#173;There may be significant vitreous inflammation and vitreous cells. Sometimes, both eyes are affected si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously. Small microabscesses in the ret&#173;ina or choroid and white-centered ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages (Roth spots) may also be pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diagnosis is based on anterior chamber paracentesis and vitrectomy with vitreous and aqueous cultures and appropriate stains. As for cases of chronic postoperative endophthalmitis, PCR evaluation of ocular fluids with pan-&#173;bacterial or pan-&#173;fungal primers is extremely useful. Blood and other body fluid cultures should be used along with ocular culture results to confirm the diagnosis and establish therapy.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intravitreal antibiotics are administered at the time of vitrectomy. If it is not clear &#173;whether fungal organisms may be involved, treatment of both fungal and bacterial etiologies is indicated at the time of vitrectomy. In addition, intravenous antibiotic treatment is sometimes required for several weeks, depending on the organism isolated. Similarly, in patients who have endogenous fungal endophthalmitis, systemic antifungal therapy may be warranted for 6 weeks or more. Initial antimicrobial choices may be empiric and subsequently tailored to culture results.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The complications of endogenous endophthalmitis can be serious. If the diagnosis of systemic infection is missed, the patient may develop sepsis and even die. In severe cases, recurrent or per&#173;sis&#173;tent intraocular infection may require numerous surgeries and repeat injections of intravitreal antibiotics. In addition, complications such as cataract development, ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, vitreous hemorrhage, macular scar, hypotony, and phthisis bulbi can occur in the most severe cases. The prognosis is directly related to the offending organism and the systemic status of the patient.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Endogenous Fungal Endophthalmitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis develops slowly as focal or multifocal areas of chorioretinitis. Granulomatous or nongranulomatous inflammation is observed with keratic precipitates, hypopyon, and vitritis with cellular aggregates. The infection usually begins in the choroid, appearing as yellow-&#173;white lesions with indistinct borders that range in size from small cotton-&#173;wool spots to several disc dia&#173;meters. It can subsequently break through into the vitreous, producing localized cellular and fungal aggregates overlying the original site(s). Iris nodules and rubeosis may also be observed in cases of severe fungal endophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis due to <span class="italic">Candida</span> (the most common cause; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-2</span>), <span class="italic">Aspergillus,</span> and <span class="italic">Coccidioides</span> species can be mistaken for noninfectious uveitis and treated with corticosteroids alone. This treatment usually worsens the clinical course of the disease, necessitating further investigation to establish the correct diagnosis. &#173;There is often a history of indwelling line or intravenous drug abuse. The condition often requires aggressive systemic and local antifungal therapy as well as surgical intervention.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis caused by <span class="italic">Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporothrix schenckii,</span> and <span class="italic">Blastomyces dermatitidis</span> is less common than that caused by <span class="italic">Candida</span> and <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> species.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-1">Candida</span> endophthalmitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Candida</span> species are an impor&#173;tant cause of nosocomial infections and are the most common fungal organisms, causing endogenous endophthalmitis in both pediatric and adult populations. Although <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> remains the most common pathogen, non-&#173;<span class="italic">albicans</span> species (eg, <span class="italic">Candida glabrata</span>) have also been identified in patients developing ocular disease. In patients with candidemia, the reported prevalence rates of intraocular candidiasis vary widely, ranging between 9% and 78%. However, when strict criteria are applied for the classification of chorioretinitis and endophthalmitis, &#173;these numbers drop precipitously. In 1&#160;series, when patients &#173;were examined within 72 hours of a positive blood culture result, only 9% had chorioretinitis and none had endophthalmitis. Endogenous <span class="italic">Candida</span> endophthalmitis occurs in up to 37% of patients with candidemia if they are not receiving antifungal therapy. Ocular involvement drops to 3% in patients who are receiving treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Predisposing conditions associated with candidemia and the development of intraocular infection include</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-13"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> Patients may pres&#173;ent with blurred or decreased vision resulting from macular chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal involvement or pain arising from anterior uveitis, which may be severe. Typically, <span class="h4-text_italic">Candida</span> chorioretinitis is characterized by multiple, bilateral, white, well-&#173;circumscribed lesions less than 1&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter. &#173;These lesions are distributed throughout the postequatorial fundus and associated with overlying vitreous cellular inflammation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-3</span>). The chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions may be associated with vascular sheathing and intraret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages. The vitreous exudates may assume a string-&#173;of-&#173;pearls appearance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, <span class="italic">Candida</span> species are recognized as budding yeast with a characteristic pseudohyphate appearance (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-4</span>). The organisms reach the eye hematogenously through metastasis to the choroid. Fungi may then break through the Bruch membrane, form subret&#173;i&#173;nal abscesses, and secondarily involve the ret&#173;ina and vitreous.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-13"><span class="h4-head">Diagnosis</span> The diagnosis of ocular candidiasis is suggested by the presence of chorioretinitis or endophthalmitis in the appropriate clinical context and confirmed by positive results on &#173;either blood or vitreous cultures. It has been suggested that all patients with candidemia undergo baseline dilated funduscopic examinations and receive monitoring for the development of metastatic ocular candidiasis for at least 2 weeks &#173;after an initial eye examination. The reasoning is that earlier treatment of <span class="h4-text_italic">Candida</span> endophthalmitis has been associated with better visual outcomes, and patients with ocular lesions are more likely to have infection involving a greater number of organ systems than are patients without eye lesions. The presence of vitreous snowballs and endophthalmitis requires diagnostic and therapeutic vitrectomy. Fungal stains and cultures, and PCR for <span class="h4-text_italic">Candida</span> species, should be obtained on undiluted vitreous fluid samples.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of <span class="italic">Candida</span> endophthalmitis includes toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis, which exhibits posterior pole lesions that can appear yellow-&#173;white with fluffy borders and range in size from small cotton-&#173;wool spots to several disc dia&#173;meters wide. <span class="italic">Candida</span> vitreous snowball lesions may also resemble pars planitis.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-16"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> The treatment of intraocular candidiasis includes systemic and intravitreal administration of antifungal drugs. Consultation with a specialist in infectious diseases is essential. Chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions not yet involving the vitreous body may be treated effectively with the oral triazole antifungal drugs fluconazole or voriconazole (200&#160;mg, twice daily, for 2–4 weeks), with vigilant monitoring for evidence of progression. Voriconazole has good oral bioavailability, achieving therapeutic intravitreal levels with a broad spectrum of antifungal activity. When the vitreous body is involved, intravitreal injection of antifungal drugs (amphotericin B, 5–10 µg/0.1&#160;mL, or voriconazole, 100 µg/0.1&#160;mL) should be considered, usually in conjunction with pars plana vitrectomy. Long-&#173;acting corticosteroid injections should be avoided. Vitrectomy may be useful diagnostically by allowing for the analy&#173;sis of intraocular fluid by microbiologic and molecular techniques, and therapeutically by debulking the pathogen load.</p>
			<p class="body-text">More severe infections may require intravenous amphotericin B with or without flucytosine. Significant dose-&#173;limiting toxicities (renal, cardiac, and neurologic) associated with conventional amphotericin B therapy &#173;were greatly reduced by the development of liposomal lipid complex formulations. Fi&#173;nally, intravenously administered caspofungin, an antifungal drug in the echinocandin class (drugs that inhibit synthesis of glucan in the cell wall) with activity against <span class="italic">Candida</span> and <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> species, has been successfully employed in a small number of patients with <span class="italic">Candida</span> endophthalmitis; some treatment failures have also been reported with this drug, however. Another echinocandin, intravenous micafungin, is also available in the United States and Eu&#173;rope for treatment of candidiasis. Oral voriconazole, flucytosine, fluconazole, or rifampin may be administered in addition to intravenous amphotericin B or caspofungin.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Cryptococcosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> is a yeast found in high concentrations worldwide in contaminated soil and pigeon feces. Infection is acquired through inhalation of the aerosolized fungus. It has a predilection for the central ner&#173;vous system and may produce severe disseminated disease among immunocompromised or debilitated patients. Although overall it remains an uncommon disease, cryptococcosis is the most common cause of fungal meningitis, as well as the most frequent fungal eye infection in patients with HIV infection or AIDS. The fungus prob&#173;ably reaches the eye hematogenously; however, the frequent association of ocular cryptococcosis with meningitis suggests that ocular infection may result from direct extension from the optic nerve. Ocular infections may occur months &#173;after the onset of meningitis or, in rare instances, before the onset of clinically apparent central ner&#173;vous system disease.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-18"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> Ocular findings associated with cryptococcal meningitis include mainly papilledema followed by optic atrophy and cranial nerve palsies. Other manifestations include diplopia, nystagmus, ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia. The most frequent pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of ocular cryptococcosis that is not directly related to meningoencephalitis is multifocal chorioretinitis. Associated findings include variable degrees of vitritis, vascular sheathing, exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, papilledema, and granulomatous anterior chamber inflammation. It has been hypothesized that the infection begins as a focus in the choroid, with subsequent extension and secondary involvement of overlying tissues. Severe intraocular infection progressing to endophthalmitis may be observed in the absence of meningitis or clinically apparent systemic disease.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-18"><span class="h4-head">Diagnosis and treatment</span> The clinical diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion and is supported by demonstration of the organism with India ink stains or by culture of the fungus from cerebrospinal fluid. Intravenous amphotericin B and oral flucytosine are required to halt disease progression. With optic nerve or macular involvement, the prognosis is poor for recovery of vision.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-1">Aspergillus</span> endophthalmitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endogenous <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> endophthalmitis is a rare disorder associated with disseminated aspergillosis among patients with severe chronic pulmonary diseases, cancer, endocarditis, severe immunocompromise, or intravenous drug abuse. In rare instances, <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> endophthalmitis may occur in immunocompetent patients with no apparent predisposing &#173;factors. Disseminated infection most commonly involves the lung, with the eye as the second most common site of infection. <span class="italic">Aspergillus fumigatus</span> and <span class="italic">A flavus</span> are the species most frequently isolated from patients with intraocular infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> species are found in soils and decaying vegetation. The spores of &#173;these ubiquitous saprophytic molds become airborne and seed the lungs and paranasal sinuses of &#173;humans. &#173;Human exposure is very common, but infection is rare and depends on the virulence of the fungal pathogen and immunocompetence of the host. Ocular disease occurs via hematogenous dissemination of <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> organisms to the choroid.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-16"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> Endogenous <span class="h4-text_italic">Aspergillus</span> endophthalmitis results in rapid onset of pain and loss of vision. A confluent yellowish infiltrate is often pres&#173;ent in the macula, beginning in the choroid and subret&#173;i&#173;nal space. A hypopyon can develop in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal or subhyaloidal space (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-5A</span>). Ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular occlusions, and full-&#173;thickness ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis may occur. The infection can spread to produce a dense vitritis and variable degrees of cells, flare, and hypopyon in the anterior chamber. The macular lesions form a central atrophic scar when healed. In contrast to the lesions associated with <span class="h4-text_italic">Candida</span> chorioretinitis and endophthalmitis, lesions produced by <span class="h4-text_italic">Aspergillus</span> species are larger and more likely to be hemorrhagic, and they commonly invade the ret&#173;i&#173;nal and choroidal vessels, which may result in broad areas of ischemic infarction.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Diagnosis </span>The diagnosis of endogenous <span class="h4-text_italic">Aspergillus</span> endophthalmitis is based on clinical findings combined with positive results from pars plana vitreous biopsy and cultures as well as results from Gram and fungal stains. Coexisting systemic aspergillosis can be a strong clue, especially among high-&#173;risk patients. The diagnosis requires a high degree of suspicion within the correct clinical context and is confirmed by the demonstration of septate, dichotomously branching hyphae on analy&#173;sis of vitreous fluid specimens. <span class="h4-text_italic">Aspergillus</span> organisms may be difficult to culture from the blood.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of endogenous <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> endophthalmitis includes <span class="italic">Candida</span> endophthalmitis, cytomegalovirus retinitis, <span class="italic">Toxoplasma</span> retinochoroiditis, coccidioidomycotic choroiditis or endophthalmitis, and bacterial endophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In <span class="italic">Candida</span> endophthalmitis, the vitreous is the prominent focus of infection, but in <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> endophthalmitis, the principal foci are ret&#173;i&#173;nal and choroidal vessels and the subret&#173;i&#173;nal or subret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelial space.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> Endogenous <span class="h4-text_italic">Aspergillus</span> endophthalmitis usually requires aggressive treatment with diagnostic and therapeutic pars plana vitrectomy combined with intravitreal injection of amphotericin B or voriconazole; intravitreal corticosteroids may be used in conjunction with &#173;these drugs. &#173;Because most patients with this condition have disseminated aspergillosis, systemic treatment with oral voriconazole, intravenous amphotericin B, or caspofungin is often required. Other systemic antifungal drugs, such as itraconazole, miconazole, fluconazole, and ketoconazole, may also be used. Systemic aspergillosis is best managed by an infectious diseases specialist.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Despite aggressive treatment, the visual prognosis is poor &#173;because of frequent macular involvement. Final visual acuity is usually less than 20/200.</p>

Determination of vitreous, aqueous, and plasma concentration of orally administered voriconazole in &#173;humans. <span class="reference--journal-_italic">Arch Ophthalmol.</span> 2004;122(1):42–47.</p>
			<p class="h3">Coccidioidomycosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Coccidioidomycosis is a disease produced by the dimorphic soil fungus <span class="italic">Coccidioides immitis,</span> which is endemic to the San Joaquin Valley of central California, certain parts of the southwestern United States, and parts of Central and South Amer&#173;i&#173;ca. Infection follows inhalation of dust-&#173;borne arthrospores, most commonly resulting in pulmonary infection and secondary dissemination to the central ner&#173;vous system, skin, skeleton, and eyes. Approximately 40% of infected patients are symptomatic; the vast majority pres&#173;ent with a mild upper respiratory tract infection or pneumonitis approximately 3 weeks &#173;after exposure to the organism. Erythema nodosum or multiforme may appear from 3 days to 3 weeks &#173;after the onset of symptoms. Disseminated infection is rare, occurring in less than 1% of patients with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> Ocular coccidioidomycosis is likewise uncommon, even with disseminated disease. Disseminated disease usually &#173;causes blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, phlyctenular and granulomatous conjunctivitis, episcleritis and scleritis, and extraocular nerve palsies and orbital infection. Uveal involvement is still rarer: fewer than 20 pathologically verified cases have been reported. The anterior and posterior segments are equally involved. Intraocular manifestations include unilateral or bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis, iris granulomas (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-5</span>), and a multifocal chorioretinitis characterized by multiple, discrete, yellow-&#173;white lesions usually less than 1 disc dia&#173;meter in size located in the postequatorial fundus. &#173;These choroidal granulomas may resolve, leaving punched-&#173;out chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal scars. Vitreous cellular infiltration, vascular sheathing, ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage, serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, and involvement of the optic nerve have also been reported.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Diagnosis</span> Positive results of serologic testing for anticoccidioidal antibodies in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid, vitreous, and aqueous, as well as of skin testing for exposure to coccidioidin establish the diagnosis in the correct clinical context.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> The Infectious Diseases Society of Amer&#173;i&#173;ca recommends initiating treatment with an oral azole antifungal drug such as fluconazole or itraconazole. Surgical debulking of anterior chamber granulomas, pars plana vitrectomy, and intraocular injections of amphotericin and voriconazole may be required. With systemic disease, much higher doses and a longer duration of intravenous amphotericin therapy or oral voriconazole therapy may be needed. An infectious diseases specialist is essential in the management of coccidioidomycosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Despite aggressive treatment, ocular coccidioidomycosis carries a poor visual prognosis, and most eyes require enucleation &#173;because of pain and blindness.</p>
