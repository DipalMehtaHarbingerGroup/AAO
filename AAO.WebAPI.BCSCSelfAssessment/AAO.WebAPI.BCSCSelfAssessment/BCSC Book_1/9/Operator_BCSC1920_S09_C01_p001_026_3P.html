			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An immune response is a sequence of molecular and cellular events intended to rid the host of a threat: offending pathogenic organisms, toxic substances, cellular debris, or neoplastic cells. &#173;There are 2 broad categories of immune responses, <span class="italic">innate</span> and <span class="italic">adaptive.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Innate immune responses, or <span class="italic">natu&#173;ral immunity,</span> require no prior contact with or “education” about the stimulus against which they are directed. Adaptive (or <span class="italic">acquired</span>) responses are higher-&#173;order, more specific responses directed against unique antigens. Chapter&#160;2 discusses &#173;these responses in detail. This chapter introduces the crucial cells of the immune system and their functions in innate immunity.</p>

			<p class="h1">Components of the Immune System</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Leukocytes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">White blood cells, or <span class="italic">leukocytes,</span> include several kinds of nucleated cells that can be distinguished by the shape of their nuclei and the presence or absence of cytoplasmic granules, as well as by their uptake of vari&#173;ous histologic stains. They can be broadly divided into 2 subsets:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">myeloid (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils and mast cells, monocytes and macrophages, and dendritic cells and Langerhans cells)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">lymphoid (T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and natu&#173;ral killer cells)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Neutrophils</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neutrophils possess a multilobed nucleus of varying shapes; hence, they are also called <span class="italic">polymorphonuclear leukocytes</span> (PMNs). Neutrophils also feature cytoplasmic granules and lysosomes and are the most abundant granulocytes in the blood. They are efficient phagocytes that readily clear tissues, degrade ingested material, and act as impor&#173;tant effector cells through the release of granule products and cytokines.</p>
			<p class="body-text">During the beginning or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_(medical)">acute</a> phases of&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation">inflammation</a>, neutrophils are one of the first inflammatory cells to migrate from the&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood">bloodstream</a> &#173;toward the site of inflammation. This pro&#173;cess is called&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis"><span class="italic">chemotaxis</span></a>. Neutrophils dominate the inflammatory infiltrate in experimental models and clinical examples of active bacterial infections of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis), sclera (scleritis), cornea (keratitis), and vitreous (endophthalmitis). They are also dominant in many types of active viral infections of the cornea (eg, herpes simplex virus keratitis) and ret&#173;ina (eg, herpes simplex virus retinitis). Neutrophils constitute the principal cell type in ocular inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides (discussed &#173;later) or by direct injection of most cytokines into ocular tissues.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Eosinophils</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eosinophils are characterized by the presence of abundant lysosomes and cytoplasmic granules that consist of more basic protein than other polymorphonuclear leukocytes, (thus acidic dyes, such as eosin, &#173;will bind to &#173;these proteins.) Eosinophils have receptors for, and become activated by, many mediators; interleukin-5 (IL-5) is especially impor&#173;tant. Eosinophilic granule products, such as major basic protein and ribonucleases, destroy parasites efficiently; thus, &#173;these cells accumulate at sites of parasitic infection. Eosinophils are also impor&#173;tant in allergic immune reactions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Eosinophils are abundant in the conjunctiva and tears in many forms of allergic conjunctivitis, especially atopic and vernal conjunctivitis. They are not considered major effectors for intraocular inflammation, with the notable exception of helminthic infections of the eye, especially toxocariasis.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Basophils and mast cells</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Basophils are the blood-&#173;borne equivalent of the tissue-&#173;bound mast cell. Mast cells exist in 2 major subtypes, connective tissue and mucosal, both of which can release preformed granules and synthesize certain mediators de novo that differ from &#173;those of neutrophils and eosinophils. <span class="italic">Connective tissue mast cells</span> contain abundant granules with histamine and heparin, and they synthesize prostaglandin D<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> upon stimulation. In contrast, <span class="italic">mucosal mast cells</span> normally contain low levels of histamine and require T-&#173;cell–&#173;derived growth-&#173;promoting cytokines for stimulation. Stimulated mucosal mast cells primarily synthesize leukotrienes, mainly leukotriene C4. Tissue location can alter the granule type and functional activity, but regulation of &#173;these differences is not well understood.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Mast cells act as major effector cells in immunoglobulin E (IgE)–&#173;mediated, immune-&#173;triggered inflammatory reactions, especially of the allergic or immediate hypersensitivity type. They perform this function through their expression of high-&#173;affinity Fc receptors for IgE. <span class="italic">Fc</span> (from “<span class="italic">f</span>ragment, <span class="italic">c</span>rystallizable”) refers to the constant region of immunoglobulin that binds cell surface receptors (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span>). Mast cells may also participate in the induction of cell-&#173;mediated immunity, wound healing, and other functions not directly related to IgE-&#173;mediated degranulation. Other stimuli, such as complement or certain cytokines, may also trigger degranulation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The healthy &#173;human conjunctiva contains numerous mast cells localized in the substantia propria. In certain atopic and allergic disease states, such as vernal conjunctivitis, the number of mast cells increases in the substantia propria, and the epithelium—&#173;usually devoid of mast cells—&#173;becomes densely infiltrated. The uveal tract also contains numerous connective tissue–&#173;type mast cells, whereas the cornea has none.</p>
			<p class="h3">Monocytes and macrophages</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Monocytes, the circulating cells, and macrophages, the tissue-&#173;infiltrating equivalents, are impor&#173;tant effectors in innate and adaptive immunity. They are often detectable in acute ocular infections, even if other cell types, such as neutrophils, are more numerous. Monocytes are relatively large cells (12–20 <span class="symbol">µ</span>m in suspension and up to 40 <span class="symbol">µ</span>m in tissues) that normally travel throughout the body. Most tissues have at least 2 identifiable macrophage populations: tissue resident and blood derived. Although exceptions exist, tissue-&#173;resident macrophages are monocytes that migrated into tissue during embryologic development and &#173;later acquired tissue-&#173;specific properties and cellular markers. Vari&#173;ous resident macrophages have tissue-&#173;specific names (ie, Kupffer cells in the liver, alveolar macrophages in the lung, and microglia in the brain and ret&#173;ina). Blood-&#173;derived macrophages are monocytes that have recently migrated from the blood into a fully developed tissue site.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Macrophages may serve in 3 capacities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">sentinels that recognize danger signals from pathogens and/or tissue damage</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">effectors that induce inflammation and fight pathogens directly</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">regulatory/repair cells that conduct tissue repair, regulate the adaptive immune system, and serve as checkpoints during immune cell migration</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Vari&#173;ous signals can prime resting monocytes into efficient antigen-&#173;presenting cells (APCs) and, upon additional signals, activate them into effector cells. Effective activation stimuli include exposure to bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS); phagocytosis of antibody-&#173;coated or complement-&#173;coated pathogens; or exposure to mediators released during inflammation, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) or interferon gamma (IFN-&#173;<span class="greek">γ</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Only &#173;after full activation do macrophages become most efficient at the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators and the killing and degradation of phagocytosed pathogens. Macrophages may undergo activation into <span class="italic">epithelioid cells,</span> with larger nuclei, abundant cytoplasm, and indistinct cell borders, resembling squamous epithelium. &#173;These epithelioid histiocytes are characteristic of granulomatous inflammation, &#173;either in infectious uveitis (ie, tuberculosis, syphilis, herpesviruses, fungi, parasitic uveitis) or noninfectious uveitis (ie, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Macrophages may also be activated to fuse into multinucleated <span class="italic">&#173;giant cells,</span> which may accompany granulomatous inflammation or occur in the tissue reaction to foreign material.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Dendritic cells and Langerhans cells</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dendritic cells (DCs) are terminally differentiated, bone marrow–&#173;derived, mononuclear cells that are distinct from macrophages and monocytes. &#173;These specialized cells bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems, but do not directly participate in effector activities. DCs use pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-&#173;like receptors (TLRs), to recognize pathogens. Activated DCs upregulate costimulatory molecules and produce cytokines to drive T-&#173;cell priming and effector differentiation as well as activate vari&#173;ous types of immune cells. Interestingly, antigen pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion by nonactivated, steady-&#173;state DCs might lead to T-&#173;cell unresponsiveness, promoting tolerance. All &#173;human DCs express high levels of major histocompatibility (MHC) class II (HLA-&#173;DR) molecules and may be classified by lineage markers as myeloid/classical or plasmacytoid. Dendritic cells can also be classified functionally and anatomically, as their function is linked to their location:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-3">Blood DCs are precursors of tissue and lymphoid organ DCs.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Migratory or tissue DCs reside in most epithelial tissues, where they acquire antigen and migrate via afferent lymphatics to lymph nodes. In tissue sites, DCs are enlarged (15–30 <span class="bullet-list-symbol">µ</span>m), with cytoplasmic veils that form extensions 2–3 times the dia&#173;meter of the cell and resemble the dendritic structure of neurons.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Resident or lymphoid DCs arise in lymph nodes directly from blood.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-4">Inflammatory DCs are in tissues and lymphoid organs during inflammation. Precursors include classical monocytes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Langerhans cells (LCs) are myeloid cells with dendritic cell function that reside in the epidermis and stratified epithelia of the conjunctival, corneal, buccal, gingival, and genital mucosae. LCs are identified by their many dendrites, electron-&#173;dense cytoplasm, and Birbeck granules. Interestingly, they originate from primitive hematopoiesis in the yolk sac and form a stable, self-&#173;renewing network that does not require bone marrow–&#173;derived precursors in the absence of inflammation. At rest, they are not active APCs, but activity &#173;develops &#173;after in vitro culture with specific cytokines. On activation, LCs lose their granules and transform to resemble blood and lymphoid DCs. Evidence suggests that LCs migrate along the afferent lymph vessels to the draining lymphoid organs. LCs are impor&#173;tant components of the immune system and play roles in antigen pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, control of lymphoid cell traffic, differentiation of T lymphocytes, and induction of delayed hypersensitivity. Elimination of LCs from skin before an antigen challenge inhibits induction of the contact hypersensitivity response. In the conjunctiva and limbus, LCs are the only cells that constitutively express MHC class II molecules. LCs are pres&#173;ent in the peripheral cornea, and any stimulation to the central cornea results in central migration of the peripheral LCs.</p>
			<p class="h3">Lymphocytes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lymphocytes are small (10–20 <span class="symbol">µ</span>m) cells with large, round, and dense nuclei. They are also derived from stem cell precursors within the bone marrow; however, unlike other leukocytes, lymphocytes require subsequent maturation in peripheral lymphoid organs. The expression of specific cell-&#173;surface proteins (ie, <span class="italic">surface markers</span>) can subdivide lymphocytes. &#173;These markers are in turn related to the functional and molecular activity of individual subsets. Three broad categories of lymphocytes are T lymphocytes; B lymphocytes; and non-&#173;T, non-&#173;B lymphocytes. Two types of lymphocytes participate in the innate immune response, serving as a bridge between innate and adaptive responses: (1) gamma-&#173;delta (<span class="greek">γδ</span>)&#160;T cells or sentinel T cells, also known as&#160;<span class="italic">intraepithelial lymphocytes</span>, and (2) natu&#173;ral killer (NK) cells, a subset of non-&#173;T, non-&#173;B lymphocytes. Chapter&#160;2 discusses the roles of lymphocytes in adaptive immunity.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Overview of the Innate Immune System</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The innate immune system is a relatively broad-&#173;acting rapid reaction force that recognizes “nonself” foreign substances, proteins, or lipopolysaccharides. The innate response can be thought of as a preprogrammed reaction that is immediate, requires no prior exposure to the foreign substance, and is similar for all encountered triggers. The result is the generation of biochemical mediators and cytokines that recruit innate effector cells, especially macrophages and neutrophils, to remove the offending stimulus through phagocytosis or enzymatic degradation. The innate response also alerts the cells of the adaptive immune system to reinforce and refine the attack. In endophthalmitis, bacteria-&#173;derived toxins or host cell debris stimulates the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes, leading to the production of inflammatory mediators and phagocytosis of the bacteria. Responses to <span class="italic">Staphylococcus</span> organisms are nearly identical to &#173;those mounted against any other bacteria.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An array of highly conserved pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and proteins detect similarly conserved molecular motifs, pathogen-&#173;associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), on triggering stimuli. PAMPs include proteins found only in bacterial, fungal, and viral nucleic acids. Cell-&#173;associated PRRs may be extracellular, endosomal, or cytoplasmic and include toll-&#173;like receptors (TLRs), C-&#173;type lectin receptors (CTLRs), nucleotide-&#173;binding oligomerization domain-&#173;like receptors (NOD-&#173;like receptors, or NLRs), and retinoic acid-&#173;inducible gene-&#173;I-&#173;like receptors (RIG-&#173;I-&#173;like receptors, or RLRs), among &#173;others. Since each PRR has evolved to respond to a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent PAMP, engagement of a specific PRR subtype conveys information regarding the type of infection (ie, bacterial, fungal, or viral) and the location (ie, extracellular or intracellular). In &#173;humans, &#173;there are 10 members of the TLR &#173;family. &#173;Those that respond to bacterial products (TLR1/2, TLR2/6, TLR4, TLR5) are localized in the plasma membrane of innate immune cells and sense extracellular microbes. The TLRs that detect viral nucleic acids (TLR3, TLR7, TLR9) are in endosomal compartments and interact with membrane proteins.</p>
			<p class="h2">Immunity Versus Inflammation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An immune response is the pro&#173;cess for removing an offending stimulus. An immune response that becomes clinically evident is termed an <span class="italic">inflammatory response.</span> Immunity (innate or adaptive) triggers this response and consists of a sequence of molecular and cellular events resulting in 5 cardinal clinical manifestations: pain, hyperemia, edema, heat, and loss of function. &#173;These signs are the consequence of 2 physiologic changes within a tissue: cellular recruitment and altered vascular permeability.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following pathologic findings are typical in inflammation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">infiltration of effector cells resulting in the release of biochemical and molecular mediators of inflammation, such as cytokines (eg, interleukins and chemokines) and lipid mediators (eg, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-&#173;activating &#173;factors)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">production of oxygen metabolites (eg, superoxide and nitrogen radicals)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">release of granule products as well as catalytic enzymes (eg, proteases, collagenases, and elastases)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">activation of plasma-&#173;derived enzyme systems (eg, complement components and fibrin)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;These effector systems are described in greater detail &#173;later in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adaptive and innate immune responses are a constant presence, though usually at a subclinical level. For example, ocular surface allergen exposure, which occurs daily in &#173;humans, or the nearly ubiquitous event of bacterial contamination during cataract surgery is usually cleared by innate or adaptive mechanisms <span class="italic">without</span> overt inflammation. The physiologic changes induced by innate and adaptive immunity may be indistinguishable. Compare the hypopyon of bacterial endophthalmitis, which results from innate immunity against bacterial toxins, with the hypopyon of lens-&#173;associated uveitis (excluding phacolytic glaucoma), presumably a result of an adaptive immune response against lens antigens. &#173;These hypopyons cannot be distinguished clinically or histologically.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Triggers of Innate Immunity</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Innate immune responses generally use direct triggering mechanisms. Four of the most impor&#173;tant are reviewed below and include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">bacteria-&#173;derived molecules</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">interactions between nonimmune ocular parenchymal cells and toxins or trauma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">recruitment and activation of neutrophils through the activation of vascular endothelial cells</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">innate mechanisms for the recruitment and activation of macrophages</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;1-1</span> summarizes the effector responses of the ocular innate immune system.</p>
			<p class="h2">Bacteria-&#173;Derived Molecules That Trigger Innate Immunity</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Bacterial lipopolysaccharide</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as <span class="italic">endotoxin,</span> is an intrinsic component of the cell walls of most gram-&#173;negative bacteria. Among the most impor&#173;tant triggering molecules of innate immunity, LPS consists of 3 components:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">lipid A</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">O polysaccharide</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">core oligosaccharide</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The exact structures of each component vary among species of bacteria, but all are recognized by the innate immune system. The primary receptors are the toll-&#173;like receptors (TLRs), principally TLR4 and TLR2, which are expressed on macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, as well as on B cells and T cells. Lipid A is the most potent component, capable of activating effector cells at concentrations of a few picograms per milliliter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The effects of LPS include activation of monocytes and neutrophils, leading to upregulation of genes for vari&#173;ous cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis &#173;factor [TNF]); degranulation; alternative pathway complement activation; and direct impact on the vascular endothelium. LPS is the major cause of shock, fever, and other pathophysiologic responses to bacterial sepsis, making it an impor&#173;tant cause of morbidity and mortality during gram-&#173;negative bacterial infections. Interestingly, footpad injection of LPS in rodents results in an acute anterior uveitis. This animal model is called <span class="italic">endotoxin-&#173;induced uveitis</span> (EIU; see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span>). See <span class="xref-sidebar">Clinical Examples 1-1</span> and <span class="xref-sidebar">1-2</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3">Other bacterial cell wall components</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The bacterial cell wall and membrane are complex. They contain numerous polysaccharide, lipid, and protein structures that can initiate an innate immune response in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent of adaptive immunity. Killed lysates of many types of gram-&#173;positive bacteria or mycobacteria can directly activate macrophages, making them useful as adjuvants. Some of &#173;these components have been implicated in vari&#173;ous models for arthritis and uveitis. In many cases, the molecular mechanisms might be similar to &#173;those of LPS.</p>
			<p class="h3">Exotoxins and other secretory products of bacteria</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Certain bacteria secrete products known as <span class="italic">exotoxins</span> into their surrounding microenvironment. Many of &#173;these products are enzymes that, although not directly inflammatory, can cause tissue damage and subsequent inflammation and tissue destruction. Examples of &#173;these products include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">collagenases</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">hemolysins such as streptolysin O, which can kill neutrophils by causing cytoplasmic and extracellular release of their granules</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">phospholipases such as the <span class="bullet-list_italic">Clostridium perfringens</span> <span class="bullet-list_greek">α</span>-&#173;toxins, which kill cells and cause necrosis by disrupting cell membranes</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">An intravitreal injection of a purified hemolysin BL toxin derived from <span class="italic">Bacillus cereus</span> can cause direct necrosis of ret&#173;i&#173;nal cells and ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. In animal studies, as few as 100 <span class="italic">B cereus</span> can produce enough toxin to cause complete loss of ret&#173;i&#173;nal function in 12 hours. In addition to being directly toxic, bacterial exotoxins can also be strong triggers of an innate immune response.</p>

			<p class="h2">Other Triggers or Modulators of Innate Immunity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Another form of innate immunity is the mechanism by which trauma or toxins interact directly with nonimmune ocular parenchymal cells—&#173;especially iris or ciliary body epithelium, ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium, ret&#173;i&#173;nal M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells, or corneal or conjunctival epithelium. This interaction can result in the synthesis of a wide range of mediators, cytokines, and eicosanoids. For example, phagocytosis of staphylococci by corneal epithelium, microtrauma to the ocular surface epithelium by contact lenses, chafing of iris or ciliary epithelium by an intraocular lens (IOL), or &#173;laser treatment of the ret&#173;ina can stimulate ocular cells to produce mediators that assist in the recruitment of innate effector cells such as neutrophils or macrophages. See <span class="xref-sidebar">Clinical Example 1-3</span>.</p>
			<p class="h2">Innate Mechanisms for the Recruitment and Activation of Neutrophils</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neutrophils are highly efficient effectors of innate immunity. They are categorized as &#173;either <span class="italic">resting</span> or <span class="italic">activated,</span> according to their secretory and cell membrane activity. Recruitment of resting, circulating neutrophils by the innate immune response occurs rapidly in a tightly controlled pro&#173;cess consisting of 2 events:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">neutrophil adhesion to the vascular endothelium through cell-&#173;adhesion molecules (CAMs) on leukocytes as well as on endothelial cells primarily in postcapillary venules</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">transmigration of the neutrophils through the endothelium and its extracellular matrix, mediated by chemotactic &#173;factors</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Activation of vascular endothelial cells is triggered by vari&#173;ous innate immune stimuli, such as LPS, physical injury, thrombin, histamine, or leukotriene release. <span class="italic">Neutrophil rolling</span>—&#173;a pro&#173;cess by which neutrophils bind loosely and reversibly to nonactivated endothelial cells—&#173;involves molecules on both cell types that belong to at least 3 sets of CAM families:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">selectins,</span> especially L-&#173;, E-&#173;, and P-&#173;selectin</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">integrins,</span> especially leukocyte function–&#173;associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) and macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">immunoglobulin superfamily molecules,</span> especially intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and ICAM-2</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The primary events are mediated largely by members of the selectin &#173;family and occur within minutes of stimulation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-1</span>). Nonactivated neutrophils express L-&#173;selectin, which mediates a weak bond to endothelial cells by binding to specific selectin ligands. Upon exposure to the triggering molecules described in the previous section, endothelial cells become activated, expressing in turn at least 2 other selectins (E and P) by which they can bind to the neutrophils and help stabilize the interaction in a pro&#173;cess called <span class="italic">adhesion.</span> Subsequently, other &#173;factors, such as platelet-&#173;activating &#173;factor (PAF), vari&#173;ous cytokines, and bacterial products can induce upregulation of the <span class="greek">β</span>-&#173;integrin &#173;family. As integrins are expressed, the selectins are shed, and neutrophils then bind firmly to endothelial cells through the immunoglobulin superfamily molecules.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;After adhesion, vari&#173;ous chemotactic &#173;factors are required to induce <span class="italic">transmigration</span> of neutrophils across the endothelial barrier and extracellular matrix into the tissue site. Chemotactic &#173;factors are short-&#173;range signaling molecules that diffuse in a declining concentration gradient from the source of production within a tissue to the vessel. Neutrophils have receptors for &#173;these molecules and are induced to undergo membrane changes that cause migration in the direction of highest concentration. Numerous such &#173;factors include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">complement products, such as the anaphylatoxin C5a</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">fibrin split products</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">certain neuropeptides, such as substance P</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">bacteria-&#173;derived formyl tripeptides, such as <span class="bullet-list_italic">N</span>-&#173;formyl-&#173;methionyl-&#173;leucyl-&#173;phenyl&#173;alanine (fMLP)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">leukotrienes</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_greek">α</span>-&#173;chemokines, such as IL-8</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Activation</span> of neutrophils into functional effector cells begins during adhesion and transmigration but is fully achieved upon interaction with specific signals within the injured or infected site. The most effective triggers of activation are bacteria and their toxins, especially LPS. Other innate or adaptive mechanisms (especially complement) and chemical mediators (such as leukotrienes and PAF) also contribute to neutrophil activation. Neutrophils, unlike monocytes or lymphocytes, do not leave a tissue to recirculate but remain and die.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Phagocytosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phagocytosis of bacteria and other pathogens is a pro&#173;cess mediated by receptors. The 2 most impor&#173;tant are <span class="italic">antibody Fc receptors</span> and <span class="italic">complement receptors.</span> Pathogens in an immune complex with antibody or activated complement components bind to cell-&#173;surface-&#173;membrane–&#173;expressed Fc or complement (C) receptors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The area of membrane to which the pathogen is bound invaginates and becomes a phagosome, and cytoplasmic granules and lysosomes fuse with the phagosomes. Phagocytes have multiple means of destroying microorganisms, notably, antimicrobial polypeptides residing within the cytoplasmic granules, reactive oxygen radicals generated from oxygen during the respiratory burst, and reactive nitrogen radicals. Although &#173;these mechanisms primarily destroy pathogens, released contents, such as lysosomal enzymes, may contribute to the amplification of inflammation and tissue damage.</p>
			<p class="h2">Innate Mechanisms for the Recruitment and Activation of Macrophages</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Monocyte-&#173;derived macrophages are the second impor&#173;tant type of effector cell (&#173;after neutrophils) for the innate immune response that follows trauma or acute infection. The vari&#173;ous molecules involved in monocyte adhesion and transmigration from blood into tissues are prob&#173;ably similar to &#173;those for neutrophils, although they have not been studied as thoroughly. The functional activation of macrophages, however, is more complex than that of neutrophils. Macrophages exist in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent levels or stages of metabolic and functional activity, each representing dif&#173;fer&#173;ent “programs” of gene activation and synthesis of macrophage-&#173;derived cytokines and mediators. The categories of macrophages include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">resting (immature or quiescent)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">primed</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">activated</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">stimulated or reparative</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3">Resting and scavenging macrophages</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phagocytosis removes host cell debris in the pro&#173;cess called <span class="italic">scavenging.</span> Resting macrophages are the classic scavenging cell, capable of phagocytosis and uptake of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">dead cell membranes</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">chemically modified extracellular protein (ie, acetylated or oxidized lipoproteins)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">sugar ligands, through mannose receptors</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">naked nucleic acids</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">bacterial pathogens</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Resting monocytes express at least 3 types of scavenging receptors but synthesize very low levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Scavenging can occur in the absence of inflammation. See <span class="xref-sidebar">Clinical Example 1-4</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3">Primed macrophages</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Resting macrophages become primed by exposure to certain cytokines. Upon priming, &#173;these cells become positive for MHC class II antigen and capable of functioning as APCs to T lymphocytes (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span>). Priming involves</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">activation of specialized lysosomal enzymes, such as cathepsins D and E, for degrading proteins into peptide fragments</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">upregulation of certain specific genes (ie, MHC class II), and costimulatory molecules (ie, B7.1)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">increased cycling of proteins between endosomes and the surface membrane.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Primed macrophages thus resemble dendritic cells. They can exit tissue sites by afferent lymphatic vessels to reenter the lymph node.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Activated and stimulated macrophages</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Activated macrophages are classically defined as macrophages producing the full spectrum of inflammatory and cytotoxic cytokines; thus, they mediate and amplify acute inflammation, tumor killing, and major antibacterial activity. <span class="italic">Epithelioid cells</span> and <span class="italic">&#173;giant cells</span> represent dif&#173;fer&#173;ent terminal differentiations of the activated macrophage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many dif&#173;fer&#173;ent innate stimuli can activate macrophages, including</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">cytokines derived from T lymphocytes and other cell types</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">chemokines</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">bacterial cell walls or toxins from gram-&#173;positive or acid-&#173;fast organisms</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">complement activated through the alternative pathway</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">foreign bodies composed of potentially toxic substances, such as talc or beryllium</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">exposure to certain surfaces, such as some plastics</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Activation of macrophages is also termed <span class="italic">polarization.</span> Some research classifies activated and stimulated macrophages as M1 or M2, based on the observation that certain stimuli produce distinct patterns of gene or protein expression &#173;under experimental conditions. The activation state seems to be somewhat reversible, suggesting that macrophages may switch between subsets (plasticity), depending on environmental signals. In fact, macrophage research suggests &#173;there are at least 9 distinct classes of macrophage activation. Consequently, although the M1/M2 model might be oversimplified, it does provide a framework for conceptualizing dif&#173;fer&#173;ent levels of macrophage activation in terms of acute inflammation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">M1–&#173;classically activated macrophage characteristics include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">high production of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">promotion of T helper-1 (Th1) response</li>

				<li class="bullet-list-mid">reactive oxygen or nitrogen intermediates</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">lipid mediators</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">As noted, macrophages that are partially activated to produce some inflammatory cytokines are termed <span class="italic">stimulated</span> or <span class="italic">reparative</span> macrophages (M2). Such partially activated macrophages contribute to fibrosis and wound healing through the synthesis of mitogens such as platelet-&#173;derived growth &#173;factors (PDGFs), metalloproteinases, and other matrix degradation &#173;factors as well as to angiogenesis through synthesis of angiogenic &#173;factors such as vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF).</p>

			<p class="h3-h2">Reactive oxygen intermediates</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Under certain conditions, oxygen can undergo chemical modification into highly reactive substances with the potential to damage cellular molecules and inhibit functional properties in pathogens or host cells. Three of the most impor&#173;tant oxygen intermediates are (1) the superoxide anion, (2) hydrogen peroxide, and (3) the hydroxyl radical:</p>

			<p class="body-text">Oxygen metabolites triggered by immune responses and generated by leukocytes, especially neutrophils and macrophages, are the most impor&#173;tant source of &#173;free radicals during inflammation. A wide variety of stimuli can trigger leukocyte oxygen metabolism, including</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">innate triggers, such as LPS or fMLP</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">adaptive effectors, such as complement-&#173;fixing antibodies or certain cytokines produced by activated T lymphocytes</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">other chemical mediator systems, such as C5a, PAF, and leukotrienes</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Reactive oxygen intermediates can also be generated as part of noninflammatory cellular biochemical pro&#173;cesses, especially by electron transport in the mitochondria, detoxification of certain chemicals, or interactions with environmental light or radiation. &#173;These reactive intermediates are highly toxic to living pathogens and damage pathogenic mediators such as exotoxins and lipids.</p>
			<p class="h2">Reactive Nitrogen Products</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive chemical species. Like reactive oxygen &#173;intermediates, NO is involved in vari&#173;ous impor&#173;tant biochemical functions in microorganisms and host cells. The formation of NO depends on the enzyme nitric oxide synthetase (NOS), which is in the cytosol and dependent on NADPH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Several types of NOS are known, including vari&#173;ous forms of constitutive NOS and inducible NOS (iNOS). Activation induces enhanced production of NO in certain cells, especially macrophages, via the calcium-&#173;independent, induced synthesis of iNOS. Many innate and adaptive stimuli modulate induction of iNOS, especially cytokines and bacterial toxins.</p>

			<p class="h1">Mediator Systems That Amplify Immune Responses</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although innate or adaptive effector responses may directly induce inflammation, in most cases this pro&#173;cess must be amplified to produce overt clinical manifestations. Molecules generated within the host that induce and amplify inflammation are termed <span class="italic">inflammatory mediators,</span> and mediator systems include several categories of &#173;these molecules (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;1-2</span>). Most act on target cells through receptor-&#173;mediated pro&#173;cesses, although some act in enzymatic cascades that interact in a complex fashion.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Plasma-&#173;Derived Enzyme Systems</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Complement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complement is an impor&#173;tant inflammatory mediator in the eye. Complement components account for approximately 5% of plasma protein and comprise more than 30 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent proteins. Complement is activated by 1 of 3 pathways, and this activation generates products that contribute to the inflammatory pro&#173;cess (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-3</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Classic pathway activation</span> occurs upon fixation of complement C1 by antigen–&#173;antibody (immune) complexes formed by IgM, IgG1, or IgG3.

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Complement serves the following 4 basic functions during inflammation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">coats antigenic or pathogenic surfaces with C3b to enhance phagocytosis (opsonization)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">promotes lysis of cell membranes through pore formation by the membrane attack complex (MAC)</li>

			<p class="body-text">Anaphylatoxin effects include chemotaxis, changes in cell adhesiveness, and degranulation and release of mediators from mast cells and platelets. C5a stimulates oxidative metabolism and the production and release of toxic oxygen radicals from leukocytes, as well as the extracellular discharge of leukocyte granule contents.</p>

			<p class="h3">Fibrin and other plasma &#173;factors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Fibrin</span> is the final deposition product of the coagulation pathway. Its deposition during inflammation promotes hemostasis, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and leukocyte adhesion. Fibrin is released from its circulating zymogen precursor, <span class="italic">fibrinogen,</span> upon cleavage by thrombin. In situ polymerization of smaller units gives rise to the characteristic fibrin plugs or clots. Fibrin dissolution is mediated by <span class="italic">plasmin,</span> which is activated from its zymo&#173;&#173;gen precursor, <span class="italic">plasminogen,</span> by plasminogen activators such as tissue plasminogen activator. Thrombin, which is derived principally from platelet granules, is released &#173;after any vascular injury that &#173;causes platelet aggregation and release. Fibrin may be observed in severe anterior uveitis (the “plasmoid aqueous”), and it contributes to complications such as synechiae, cyclitic membranes, and tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment.</p>
			<p class="h3">Histamine</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Histamine is pres&#173;ent in the granules of mast cells and basophils and is actively secreted &#173;after exposure to a wide range of stimuli. Histamine acts by binding to 1 of at least 3 known types of receptors that are differentially pres&#173;ent on target cells. The best-&#173;studied pathway for degranulation is antigen crosslinking of IgE bound to mast-&#173;cell Fc IgE receptors, but many other inflammatory stimuli can induce secretion, including complement, direct membrane injury, and certain drugs. Classically, histamine release has been associated with allergy. The contribution of histamine to intraocular inflammation remains subject to debate.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lipid Mediators</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Two groups of lipid molecules synthesized by stimulated cells act as power&#173;ful mediators and regulators of inflammatory responses: the arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, or <span class="italic">eicosanoids,</span> and the acetylated triglycerides, usually called <span class="italic">platelet-&#173;activating &#173;factors.</span> Both groups of molecules may be rapidly generated from the same lysophospholipid precursors by the enzymatic action of cellular phospholipases such as phospholipase A<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Eicosanoids</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All eicosanoids are derived from AA. It is liberated from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">2</span>, which is activated by vari&#173;ous agonists; AA is oxidized by 2 major pathways to generate the vari&#173;ous mediators:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, which produces prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclins</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">the 5-&#173;lipoxygenase pathway, which produces 5-&#173;hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, lipoxins, and leukotrienes</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The COX-&#173;derived products are evanescent compounds induced in virtually all cells by a variety of stimuli. In general, they act in the immediate environment of their release to directly mediate many inflammatory activities. &#173;These include effects on vascular permeability, cell recruitment, platelet function, and smooth-&#173;muscle contraction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Depending on conditions, COX-&#173;derived products can &#173;either upregulate or downregulate the production of cytokines, enzyme systems, and oxygen metabolites. The 2 forms of COX are COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is thought to be constitutively expressed by many cells, especially cells that use prostaglandin for basal metabolic functions, such as cells of the gastric mucosa and renal tubular epithelium. COX-2 is inducible by many inflammatory stimuli, including other inflammatory mediators (eg, PAF and some cytokines) and innate stimuli (eg, LPS).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prostaglandins may be the cause of uveitic macular edema in association with anterior segment surgery or inflammation. Posterior diffusion of one or more of the eicosanoids through the vitreous is assumed to alter the permeability of the perifoveal capillary network, leading to macular edema. Clinical &#173;trials in &#173;humans suggest that topical treatment with COX inhibitors (eg, NSAIDs) reduces the incidence of macular edema &#173;after cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Derivatives of 5-&#173;lipoxygenase, an enzyme found mainly in granulocytes and some mast cells, have been detected in the brain and ret&#173;ina. <span class="italic">Leukotrienes</span> prob&#173;ably contribute significantly to inflammatory infiltration; some leukotrienes have 1000 times the effect of histamine on vascular permeability. Another lipoxygenase product, lipoxin, is a potent stimulator of superoxide anion. &#173;Because many of the COX-&#173;derived prostaglandins downregulate the lipoxygenase pathway, NSAIDs can tilt AA metabolism &#173;toward increased production of inflammatory metabolites, leukotrienes, and lipoxins.</p>
			<p class="h3">Platelet-&#173;activating &#173;factors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Platelet-&#173;activating &#173;factors are a &#173;family of phospholipid-&#173;derived mediators that appear to be impor&#173;tant stimuli in the early stage of inflammation. &#173;These &#173;factors also serve physiologic functions unrelated to inflammation, especially in reproductive biology, the physiology of secretory epithelium, and neurobiology. In &#173;these physiologic roles, a de novo biosynthetic pathway has been identified. However, the <span class="italic">remodeling pathway</span> is the one implicated in PAF inflammatory actions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Phospholipase A<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> metabolizes phosphocholine precursors in cell membranes, releasing AA and PAF precursors, which are acetylated into multiple species of PAF. PAF release is stimulated by vari&#173;ous innate immune triggers, such as bacterial toxins, trauma, and cytokines. Platelet-&#173;activating &#173;factors activate not only platelets but also most leukocytes, which in turn produce and release additional PAFs. They function by binding to one or more guanosine triphosphate protein–&#173;associated receptors on target cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In vitro, PAFs induce an impressive repertoire of responses, including phagocytosis, exocytosis, superoxide production, chemotaxis, aggregation, proliferation, adhesion, eicosanoid generation, degranulation, and calcium mobilization, as well as diverse morphologic changes. PAFs are a major regulator of cell adhesion and vascular permeability in many forms of acute inflammation, trauma, shock, and ischemia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The precise role of PAFs in intraocular inflammation remains unknown, but synergistic interactions prob&#173;ably exist among PAFs, nitric oxide, eicosanoids, and cytokines. However, intravitreal injection of PAFs in animals induces an acute retinitis and photoreceptor toxicity.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cytokines</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cytokines are soluble polypeptide mediators synthesized and released by cells for the purposes of intercellular signaling and communication. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;1-3</span> lists examples of cytokines associated with ocular inflammation. Vari&#173;ous types of intercellular signaling occur, including <span class="italic">paracrine</span> (signaling of neighboring cells at the same site), <span class="italic">autocrine</span> (stimulation of a receptor on its own surface, and <span class="italic">endocrine</span> (action on a distant site through release into the blood).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Traditionally, investigators have subdivided cytokines into families with related activities, sources, and targets, using terms such as <span class="italic">growth &#173;factors, interleukins, lymphokines, interferons, monokines,</span> and <span class="italic">chemokines.</span> Thus, <span class="italic">growth &#173;factor</span> traditionally refers to cytokines mediating cell proliferation and differentiation. The terms <span class="italic">interleukin</span> and <span class="italic">lymphokine</span> identify cytokines thought to mediate intercellular communication among lymphocytes or other leukocytes. Interferons are cytokines that limit or interfere with the ability of a virus to infect a cell. Monokines are immunoregulatory cytokines secreted by monocytes and macrophages. Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines. Although some cytokines are specific for par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar cell types, most have such degrees of multiplicity and redundancy of source, function, and target that it is not particularly useful for the clinician to classify cytokines on the basis of the families discussed above. For example, activated macrophages in an inflammatory site synthesize growth &#173;factors, interleukins, interferons, and chemokines.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Both innate and adaptive responses result in the production of cytokines. T lymphocytes are the classic cytokine-&#173;producing cell of adaptive immunity, but macrophages, mast cells, and neutrophils also synthesize a wide range of cytokines upon stimulation. Cytokine interactions can be additive, combinatorial, synergistic, or antagonistic. Elimination of the action of a single molecule may have an unpredictable outcome; for example, monoclonal antibodies directed against TNF-&#173;<span class="greek">α</span> result in substantial suppression of immune responses but also increase susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Fi&#173;nally, not only do innate and adaptive immune responses use cytokines as mediators and amplifiers of inflammation, but cytokines also modulate the initiation of immune responses; the function of most leukocytes is altered by preexposure to vari&#173;ous cytokines. Thus, for many cytokines, their regulatory role may be as impor&#173;tant as their actions as mediators of inflammation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Neutrophil-&#173;Derived Granule Products</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neutrophils are also a source of specialized products that can amplify immune responses. Many antimicrobial polypeptides are pres&#173;ent in neutrophilic granules. The principal ones are bactericidal/permeability-&#173;increasing protein, defensins, lysozyme, lactoferrin, and the serine proteases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to antimicrobial polypeptides, neutrophils contain numerous other molecules that may contribute to inflammation. &#173;These compounds include hydrolytic enzymes, elastase, metalloproteinases, gelatinase, myeloperoxidase, vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span>–&#173;binding protein, cytochrome <span class="italic">b</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">558</span>, and &#173;others. Granule contents remain inert and membrane-&#173;bound when the granules are intact and become active and soluble when granules fuse to the phagocytic vesicles or plasma membrane.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An example of a neutrophil-&#173;derived granule product is collagenase. Vari&#173;ous forms of collagenase contribute to corneal injury and liquefaction during bacterial keratitis and scleritis, especially in infections with <span class="italic">Pseudomonas</span> species. Collagenases also contribute to peripheral corneal melting syndromes secondary to rheumatoid arthritis–&#173;associated peripheral keratitis.</p>

					<p class="sidebar-h2 ParaOverride-1"><span class="sidebar-h2">Lipopolysaccharide-&#173;induced uveitis</span> &#173;Humans are intermittently exposed to low levels of LPS that the gut releases, especially during episodes of diarrhea and dysentery. Exposure to LPS may play a role in dysentery-&#173;related uveitis, arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Systemic administration of a low dose of LPS in rabbits, rats, and mice produces a mild acute uveitis. This effect occurs at doses of LPS lower than &#173;those that cause apparent systemic shock. In rabbits, a breakdown of the blood–&#173;ocular barrier occurs &#173;because of loosening of the tight junctions between the nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells, which allows leakage of plasma proteins through uveal vessels. Rats and mice exhibit an acute neutrophilic and monocytic infiltrate in the iris and ciliary body within 24 hours.</p>
					<p class="sidebar-text">The precise mechanism of the LPS-&#173;induced ocular effects &#173;after systemic administration is unknown. One possibility is that LPS circulates and binds to the vascular endothelium or other sites within the anterior uvea. Alternatively, LPS might cause activation of uveal macrophages or circulating leukocytes, leading them to preferentially adhere to the anterior uveal vascular endothelium. Toll-&#173;like receptor 2 (TLR2) recognizes LPS, and binding of LPS by TLR2 on macrophages results in macrophage activation and secretion of a wide array of inflammatory cytokines. Degranulation of platelets is among the first histologic changes in LPS uveitis; likely mediators are eicosanoids, platelet-&#173;activating &#173;factors, and vasoactive amines. The subsequent intraocular generation of several mediators, especially leukotriene B4, thromboxane B2, prostaglandin E2, and IL-6 correlates with the development of the cellular infiltrate and vascular leakage.</p>
					<p class="sidebar-text">Not surprisingly, direct injection of LPS into vari&#173;ous ocular sites can initiate a severe localized inflammatory response. For example, intravitreal injection of LPS triggers a dose-&#173;dependent neutrophilic and monocytic infiltration of the uveal tract, ret&#173;ina, and vitreous. Injection of LPS into the central cornea results in the development of a ring infiltrate comprised of neutrophils that migrated circumferentially from the limbus.</p>

					<p class="sidebar-h2 ParaOverride-1"><span class="sidebar-h2">Role of bacterial toxin production in the severity of endophthalmitis</span> As described in Clinical Example 1-1, intraocular injection of LPS is highly inflammatory and accounts for much of the enhanced pathogenicity of gram-&#173;negative infections of the eye. Using clinical isolates or bacteria genet&#173;ically altered to diminish production of the vari&#173;ous types of bacterial toxins, investigators have demonstrated that toxin elaboration in gram-&#173;positive or gram-&#173;negative endophthalmitis greatly influences inflammatory cell infiltration and ret&#173;i&#173;nal cytotoxicity. This effect suggests that sterilization through antibiotic therapy alone, in the absence of antitoxin therapy, may not prevent activation of innate immunity, ocular inflammation, and vision loss in eyes infected by toxin-&#173;producing strains.</p>

Although UGH syndrome was more common when rigid anterior chamber lenses &#173;were used during the early 1980s, it has also been reported with posterior chamber lenses, particularly when a haptic of a 1-&#173;piece lens is inadvertently placed in the sulcus. The pathogenesis of UGH syndrome appears related to mechanisms for activation of innate immunity. A likely mechanism is cytokine and eicosanoid synthesis triggered by mechanical chafing or trauma to the iris or ciliary body. Plasma-&#173;derived enzymes, especially complement or fibrin, can enter the eye through vascular permeability altered by surgery or trauma and can then be activated by the surface of IOLs. Adherence of bacteria and leukocytes to the surface has also been implicated. Toxicity caused by contaminants on the lens surface during manufacturing is rare. Nevertheless, noninflamed eyes with IOLs can demonstrate histologic evidence of low-&#173;grade, foreign-&#173;body reactions around the haptics.</p>
