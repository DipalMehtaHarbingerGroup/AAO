			<p class="em-only_endmatter-sq-question">&#9;24.&#9;A 23-&#173;year-&#173;old male medical student is very anxious about some test results and seeks further information from an ophthalmologist. He reports that during a class about &#173;human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, his medical school performed HLA screening on all of the students, and he learned that he is positive for HLA-&#173;B27. He is now exceedingly worried about developing acute anterior uveitis (AAU). What counseling should the ophthalmologist provide to this patient &#173;after a normal eye examination?</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-sq-question-choice">a.&#9;Almost 10% of individuals who are HLA-&#173;B27 positive manifest AAU, but it typically affects females, so he does not need to worry.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-sq-question-choice">b.&#9;Approximately 8% of the population is positive for HLA-&#173;B27, while only 0.012% of the population &#173;will develop AAU, so it is much more likely that he &#173;will never manifest AAU.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-sq-question-choice">c.&#9;Almost two-&#173;thirds of individuals who are HLA-&#173;B27 positive manifest AAU, so &#173;there is real risk of his developing the disease, and he should be monitored closely.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-sq-question-choice">d.&#9;&#173;There is no need to worry, &#173;because HLA-&#173;B27 is not associated with AAU. It is recommended that he see a rheumatologist, &#173;because HLA-&#173;B27 is associated with the seronegative spondyloarthropathies.</p>

			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> The innate immune response is fast acting, nonspecific, and the same for all pathogen exposures. Of the reactions listed, only the production of reactive oxygen species is part&#160;of the innate immune response. Plasma cell induction, the formation of antibodies, and establishing memory B cells are all part&#160;of the more pathogen-&#173;specific, targeted, and slower adaptive immune response.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;2.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> Basophils are the blood-&#173;borne equivalent of the tissue-&#173;bound mast cell. Once basophils leave the bloodstream and take residence in tissue, they become mast cells. The other answer choices are incorrect pairings of blood- and tissue-&#173;equivalent cells.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;3.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> Given the lack of symptoms and this being the patient’s first pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion at 78&#160;years of age, the diagnosis is unlikely to be uveitic in nature. While his age places him in the right demographic for lymphoma, his vitreous cavity was clear and the diagnosis of primary intraocular lymphoma is unlikely (although this should certainly be considered, as it is one of the masquerade syndromes for uveitis). While extensive intraocular surgery can result in breakdown of the blood–&#173;aqueous barrier, it does not typically result &#173;after cataract surgery (nor would it explain his hypotony and absence of cells in the left eye). The most likely diagnosis is ocular ischemia, a masquerade syndrome for uveitis, and carotid Doppler images should be ordered to assess for right-&#173;sided stenosis of the carotid artery.</p>

It is most common in middle-&#173;aged white men. Migratory arthritis occurs in 80% of cases, and diarrhea, steatorrhea, and malabsorption occur in 75%. Central ner&#173;vous system involvement occurs in 10% of cases and results in seizures, dementia, and coma. Neuro-&#173;ophthalmic signs can include cranial nerve palsies, nystagmus, and ophthalmoplegia. Intraocular involvement occurs in less than 5% of cases. Patients can pre&#173;sent with bilateral panuveitis, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, and multifocal chorioretinitis. The gold standard for diagnosis of Whipple disease is a duodenal biopsy that demonstrates a periodic acid–&#173;Schiff–&#173;positive bacillus in macrophages within intestinal villi.</p>

Posterior segment findings of acquired syphilis include vitritis, chorioretinitis, focal/multifocal retinitis, necrotizing retinochoroiditis, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, isolated papillitis, and neuroretinitis. Syphilis may pre&#173;sent as a focal retinitis or as a peripheral necrotizing retinochoroiditis that may resemble acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis or progressive outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis.</p>

In addition, diabetes mellitus has been implicated as a risk &#173;factor for WNV-&#173;related death. Systemically, a patient may pre&#173;sent with fever, myalgias, headache, conjunctivitis, and a maculopapular rash. Cardiomyopathy has not been associated with an increased risk of WNV-&#173;associated mortality.&#9;</p>

However, in herpetic intraocular infections, particularly with herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 as well as varicella-&#173;zoster virus, &#173;there may be nongranulomatous or granulomatous KPs as well. In this question, stellate KPs are identified and, when pre&#173;sent, often are found diffusely. The KPs localizing only to the Arlt triangle are classically found in noninfectious etiologies of intraocular inflammation and may be &#173;either granulomatous or nongranulomatous. Coin-&#173;shaped lesions are found in cytomegalovirus anterior uveitis.</p>

However, when &#173;there is vitreal involvement as well, pars plana vitrectomy in conjunction with systemic antifungals should be considered. In addition, at the time of surgery, intraocular injection of antifungals may be considered. Oral voriconazole for this par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar case is the best option, given that it &#173;will have excellent intraocular penetration and &#173;there is not vitreal involvement at this time, so vitrectomy is not required. Periocular or intraocular depot corticosteroid injection should be avoided, &#173;because this can make the endophthalmitis worse. Intravitreal injection of an antifungal alone is unlikely to result in adequate treatment of the current chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions, and systemic therapy is warranted.</p>

The granulomas may resemble follicles, but histopathologically are granulomas. Uveal/intraocular involvement is less common than conjunctival involvement. The anterior segment features may include granulomatous keratic precipitates (ocular hypertension is not a classic feature), as well as iris nodules, which are granulomas on histopathology. Choroidal involvement pre&#173;sents as multifocal choroidal granulomas with a preferential location for the postequatorial region of the fundus.</p>

The cytopathology secures the diagnosis. In more than two-&#173;thirds of cases of PVRL, patients &#173;will have or &#173;will go on to develop intracranial disease. In fact, PVRL is a subset of primary central ner&#173;vous system lymphoma (PCNSL).

Aside from chronic inflammation associated with uveitis, other &#173;causes of calcific band keratopathy include systemic disorders that cause hypercalcemia or elevated serum phosphorus, as well as silicone oil (particularly in an aphakic eye), exposure to mercurial vapors or preservative, and primary hereditary band keratopathy.</p>

Optical coherence tomography of the macula can help identify contributing &#173;factors to the macular edema, such as vitreomacular traction. If &#173;there is prominent vitreomacular traction, a pars plana vitrectomy may be considered. In this case, however, while &#173;there is uveitic macular edema, the imaging is other&#173;wise unremarkable. If &#173;there was per&#173;sis&#173;tently active intraocular inflammation that may be driving the uveitic macular edema, advancing a patient’s systemic therapy may be beneficial. However, this patient’s intraocular inflammation is inactive. In addition, advancing therapy from an antimetabolite (mycophenolate mofetil) to an alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide) is not indicated, &#173;because alkylating agents are reserved for aggressive, sight-&#173;threatening &#173;causes of ocular inflammation due to their significant side effects. Similarly, intravenous methylprednisolone would not be indicated as the first step in managing this patient’s macular edema, although such therapy can be used initially for robust intraocular inflammation that needs to be managed quickly and requires doses higher than what may be needed with oral corticosteroids. The use of periocular sub-&#173;Tenon triamcinolone, then, is the best initial choice in managing this patient’s uveitic macular edema.</p>

Such inflammation can be managed with systemic corticosteroids. The best answer choice listed is to continue oral valganciclovir and start systemic corticosteroids. Use of periocular ste&#173;roids should proceed with caution, &#173;because &#173;there is a chance that &#173;there may be a recurrence of the CMV retinitis. Intraocular ste&#173;roids should be avoided as a first-&#173;line therapy for managing immune recovery uveitis. Certainly, if periocular ste&#173;roids &#173;were to be considered, antivirals should be continued. &#173;There is no role for pars plana vitrectomy as a first-&#173;line therapy for this patient. While &#173;there may be a significant amount of vitreous debris associated with inflammation, a trial of systemic corticosteroids may preclude the development of significant debris. Discontinuing antiretroviral therapy is not advisable, as the goal of therapy is to improve the CD4<span class="endmatter-answers_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> T-&#173;lymphocyte count and decrease the patient’s overall risk for the development of opportunistic infections.</p>

Their antigenic sites are called <span class="endmatter-answers_italic">idiotopes</span>, as distinguished from <span class="endmatter-answers_italic">epitopes</span>, which are the antigenic sites on foreign molecules. An allotope is a site on the constant or nonvarying portion of an antibody molecule that can be recognized by a combining site of other antibodies.

Activation of natu&#173;ral killer cells is a rapid, nonspecific, “generic” response to any pathogen and is part&#160;of the innate immune response (although natu&#173;ral killer cells can also take part&#160;in the adaptive immune response; on the other hand, antigen pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, B cells, and T cells do not also take part&#160;in the innate immune response).</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;19.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> &#173;There is an abundance of antigen-&#173;presenting cells (macrophages, dendritic cells) in mucosa-&#173;associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). However, their role is to convey antigen to local lymph nodes for pro&#173;cessing; they do not create a population of memory B cells. While immunoglobulin A (IgA) is pre&#173;sent abundantly in tears, IgA does not provide for a secondary adaptive immune response. One defining feature of the MALT system is that it is an interconnected system of lymphatic function, such that prior exposure at any MALT site &#173;will allow for a secondary adaptive immune response (eg, via a population of memory B cells) at &#173;every MALT site. However, prior exposure anywhere in the body (eg, a skin abrasion) does not sensitize and prime the MALT system for &#173;future exposure.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;20.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> The high success rates of corneal transplantation are due to effective corneal immunoregulation that renders the cornea immune privileged. The 2 major mechanisms that establish this are intact limbal physiology (which prevents blood vessels from crossing over onto the corneal surface) and anterior chamber–&#173;associated immune deviation, which attenuates inflammatory reactions in the anterior chamber and on the endothelial surface. The answer choices “effector blockade, attenuated antigen pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion” (b) and “immune privilege site, mucosa-&#173;associated lymphatic tissue, and blood–&#173;aqueous barrier” (c) are not paired with the proper effector mechanisms. The answer choice “effector blockade, attenuated natu&#173;ral killer cells and lymphocyte activity” (d), while paired with the appropriate effectors, does not modulate corneal immune responses, but rather anterior uveal immune responses.</p>

Dense pseudomembranes can certainly form in the setting of viral conjunctivitis secondary to aggressive strains of adenovirus; however, &#173;these are not pre&#173;sent at the onset of symptoms and tend to appear &#173;after days of prolonged inflammation. Also, while viral conjunctivitis commonly spreads to the other eye, not only does it typically take a few days to occur, but the patient would not be asymptomatic in the fellow eye, and she did not report any symptoms in her left eye. The most likely finding in this setting is the presence of swollen submandibular glands, given that the preauricular and submandibular lymphatics drain the conjunctival surface.</p>

Although a pro&#173;cess similar to anterior chamber–&#173;associated immune deviation has been observed &#173;after subret&#173;i&#173;nal injections of antigen, it is not clear if this is a ret&#173;i&#173;nal or RPE pro&#173;cess.

Mucosa-&#173;associated lymphid tissue is responsible for conjunctival antigenic pro&#173;cessing, but the effector limb of this system can spill over onto the corneal surface and recruit immune effectors to the cornea. Limbal physiology is the only answer choice that keeps immune effectors from reaching the central cornea (ie, makes the cornea immune privileged), mainly by serving as a barrier to vascularization of the cornea, which would provide &#173;great immune access to the central cornea, but at the cost of severe reduction in vision.</p>

Fibrinous anterior chamber reactions and hypopyons typically pre&#173;sent in the setting of brisk anterior chamber inflammatory reactions that are typically quite symptomatic (eg, acute anterior uveitis). Vitritis is a feature of intermediate and posterior uveitis, but is typically not seen in the setting of CAU (patients can manifest anterior vitreous cell in the setting of CAU, but this is not the same as vitritis).</p>

Adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab, golimumab, and etanercept are TNF-&#173;<span class="endmatter-answers_greek CharOverride-12">α</span> inhibitors. TNF inhibitors have been associated with central ner&#173;vous system demyelination (promoting or unmasking multiple sclerosis), increased risk of malignancy such as lymphoma, hepatitis B reactivation, and deep fungal and other serious aty&#173;pi&#173;cal infections. Their use is not recommended in patients with demyelinating disease, such as multiple sclerosis.

In individuals with no specific contraindications, mild to moderate noninfectious anterior scleritis, &#173;either diffuse or nodular, may be primarily managed with oral nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for a few weeks. More severe noninfectious cases, refractory to NSAIDs, or with posterior or necrotizing disease, are managed with systemic corticosteroids, typically with an initial dose of predinsone 1&#160;mg/kg/day or equivalent, followed by a slow tapering regimen.</p>

Posterior scleritis can be associated with infammatory conditions at rates similar to anterior uveitis. Necrotizing scleritis without (overt) inflammation, is called <span class="endmatter-answers_italic">scleromalacia perforans</span>.

Sacro&#173;iliac imaging studies should be obtained when indicated by a suggestive history. Patients should be informed of the risk of deformity and referred to a rheumatologist. Pulmonary apical fibrosis and cardiovascular disease (aortic valvular insufficiency) may also develop, so if the patient is symptomatic, it may be worthwhile to do chest imaging or cardiac echogram to rule &#173;these out. Although &#173;these patients may pre&#173;sent with hypopyon, this is usually sterile, so aqueous tap is not indicated &#173;unless for research purposes. Pathergy is a skin condition in which a minor trauma such as a bump or bruise leads to the development of skin lesions or ulcers that may be resistant to healing. Pathergy is seen with both Beh<span class="endmatter-answers_accent">ç</span>et disease and pyoderma gangrenosum. Urinalysis is usually not indicated in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.</p>

It may pre&#173;sent only with scleritis, initially. In addition to testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, early detection of renal involvement with urinalysis is impor&#173;tant, as glomerulonephritis develops in up to 85% of patients during the course of the disease and carries significant mortality if left untreated. Antinuclear antibodies are autoantibodies that bind to contents of the cell nucleus. They are found in systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj<span class="endmatter-answers_accent">ö</span>gren syndrome, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, autoimmune hepatitis, and drug-&#173;induced lupus.
