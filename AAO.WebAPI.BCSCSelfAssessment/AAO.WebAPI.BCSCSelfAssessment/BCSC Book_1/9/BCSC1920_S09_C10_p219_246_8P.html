			<div id="Chapt10_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Syphilis is a reemerging multisystem, chronic bacterial infection caused by the spirochete <span class="italic">Treponema pallidum.</span> It is associated with numerous ocular manifestations in both the acquired and congenital forms of the disease. Transmission occurs most often through sexual contact; however, transplacental infection of the fetus is also pos&#173;si&#173;ble, mainly &#173;after the tenth week of pregnancy. Having reached an all-&#173;time low in the year 2000&#160;in the United States, the incidence rate of syphilis at any disease stage has been rising in the last 2 de&#173;cades, not only in men, particularly &#173;those having sex with men, but also among &#173;women. This rise is associated with an almost twofold increase in the incidence of congenital syphilis in the United States (from 9.4 to 15.7 per 100,000 live births).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although syphilis is thought to be responsible for less than 2% of all uveitis cases, it is one of the &#173;great masqueraders in medicine and should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of any intraocular inflammatory disease. It is one of the few entities that can be cured with appropriate antimicrobial therapy, even in patients with &#173;human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. Delay in the diagnosis of syphilitic uveitis may lead not only to permanent vision loss but also to significant neurologic and cardiac morbidity, which may have been averted with early treatment.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Congenital Syphilis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The prevalence of congenital syphilis is increasing in the United States in parallel to higher rates of infection in young &#173;women, associated with limited to late or even absent prenatal care, without proper serologic screening. Primary or secondary syphilis in the &#173;mother is more likely to be transmitted to the baby than is latent syphilis; the longer the &#173;mother had syphilis, the less likely is the transmission. Systemic findings in patients with early congenital syphilis (age 2&#160;years or younger) include hepatosplenomegaly, characteristic changes of the long bones on radiographic examination, abdominal distention, desquamative skin rash, low birth weight, pneumonia, and severe anemia. Late manifestations (age 3&#160;years or older) result from scarring during early systemic disease. &#173;These include Hutchinson teeth, mulberry molars, abnormal facies, cranial nerve VIII deafness, bony changes such as saber shins and perforations of the hard palate, cutaneous lesions such as rhagades, and neurosyphilis. Cardiovascular complications are unusual in late congenital syphilis. For further discussion of ocular manifestations of congenital syphilis, see BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;6</span>, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular inflammatory signs of congenital syphilis may pres&#173;ent at birth or de&#173;cades &#173;later and include uveitis, interstitial keratitis, optic neuritis, glaucoma, and congenital cataract. Multifocal chorioretinitis and, less commonly, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis are the most frequent uveitic manifestations of early congenital infection. They may result in a bilateral salt-&#173;and-&#173;pepper fundus, which affects the peripheral ret&#173;ina, posterior pole, or even a single quadrant. &#173;These changes are not progressive, and the patient may have normal vision. A less commonly described fundus finding is that of a bilateral secondary degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which may mimic retinitis pigmentosa, with narrowing of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal and choroidal vessels, optic disc pallor with sharp margins, and morphologically variable deposits of pigment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nonulcerative stromal interstitial keratitis, often accompanied by anterior uveitis, is the most common inflammatory sign of untreated late congenital syphilis, occurring in up to 50% of cases, most commonly in girls (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-1</span>). Intraocular inflammation in this setting is thought to be reactive to <span class="italic">T pallidum</span> in the cornea (keratouveitis). Symptoms include intense pain and photophobia. Blood vessels invade the cornea, and late stages show deep “ghost” (nonperfused) stromal vessels and corneal opacities. Left untreated, corneal inflammation may regress but leave the cornea focally or diffusely opaque, with reduced vision, even to the level of light perception only. Anterior uveitis accompanying interstitial keratitis may be difficult to observe &#173;because of corneal haze. Glaucoma may also occur. The constellation of interstitial keratitis, cranial nerve VIII deafness, and Hutchinson teeth is called the <span class="italic">Hutchinson triad.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Acquired Syphilis</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Primary syphilis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Primary syphilis</span> follows an incubation period of approximately 3 weeks and is characterized by a chancre, a painless, solitary lesion that originates at the site of inoculation, resolving spontaneously within 12 weeks regardless of treatment. The central ner&#173;vous system (CNS) may be seeded with treponemes during this period, often in the absence of neurologic findings.</p>
			<p class="h3">Secondary syphilis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Secondary syphilis</span> occurs 6–8 weeks &#173;later and is heralded by the appearance of lymphadenopathy and a generalized maculopapular rash that may be prominent on the palms and &#173;soles. Uveitis occurs in approximately 10% of cases. This phase is followed by a latent period ranging from 1 year (early latency) to de&#173;cades (late latency).</p>
			<p class="h3">Tertiary syphilis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately one-&#173;third of untreated patients incur <span class="italic">tertiary syphilis,</span> which may be further subcategorized as benign tertiary syphilis (the characteristic lesion being gumma, most frequently found on the skin and mucous membranes but also in the choroid and iris), cardiovascular syphilis, and neurosyphilis. Although uveitis may occur in up to 5% of patients whose disease has progressed to tertiary syphilis, it can occur at any stage of infection, including primary disease. &#173;Because the eye is an extension of the CNS, ocular syphilis is best regarded as a variant of neurosyphilis, a notion that has impor&#173;tant diagnostic and therapeutic implications.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ocular Involvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular manifestations of syphilis are protean and may affect all structures, including conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, lens, uveal tract, ret&#173;ina, optic nerve, cranial nerves, and pupillomotor pathways. Patients pres&#173;ent with pain, redness, photophobia, blurred vision, and floaters. Intraocular inflammation may be granulomatous or nongranulomatous, unilateral or bilateral, and it may affect the anterior or posterior segment. Anterior segment findings can include iris roseola, vascularized papules (iris papulosa), larger red nodules (iris nodosa), and gummata. Interstitial keratitis, posterior synechiae, lens dislocation, and iris atrophy can also occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Posterior segment findings of acquired syphilis include vitritis, chorioretinitis, focal/multifocal retinitis, necrotizing retinochoroiditis, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, isolated papillitis, and neuroretinitis. A focal or multifocal chorioretinitis, usually associated with a variable degree of vitritis, is the most common manifestation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig </span><span class="xref-figure">10-2</span>). &#173;These lesions are typically small, grayish yellow, and located in the postequatorial fundus, but they may become confluent. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis and disc edema, with exudates appearing around the disc and the ret&#173;i&#173;nal arterioles, together with serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, may accompany the chorioretinitis. A syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis has been described, the clinical appearance and angiographic characteristics of which are thought to be pathognomonic of secondary syphilis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-3 and Video 10-1</span>). Solitary or multifocal, macular or papillary, placoid, yellowish gray lesions at the level of the RPE, often with accompanying vitritis, display corresponding early hypofluorescence and late staining, along with ret&#173;i&#173;nal perivenous staining on fluorescein angiography (FA). Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography shows hypofluorescent spots corresponding to the lesions. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) displays irregularities at the level of the RPE, with corresponding disor&#173;ga&#173;ni&#173;za&#173;tion of outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal layers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Less common posterior segment involvement includes focal retinitis, periphlebitis, and, infrequently, exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Syphilis may pres&#173;ent as a focal retinitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-4</span>) or as a peripheral necrotizing retinochoroiditis that may resemble acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis or progressive outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis. Punctate inner ret&#173;i&#173;nal infiltrates have also been described (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-5</span>). Although the foci of retinitis may become confluent and are frequently associated with ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, syphilitic retinitis is more slowly progressive and responds dramatically to therapy with intravenous penicillin, often with a good visual outcome. Isolated ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis that affects the ret&#173;i&#173;nal arterioles, capillaries, and larger arteries or veins (or both) is another feature of syphilitic intraocular inflammation that may best be appreciated on FA. Focal ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis may masquerade as a branch ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein and/or arterial occlusion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Syphilis is an impor&#173;tant entity to consider in the differential diagnosis of patients with neuroretinitis and papillitis who pres&#173;ent with macular star formation. Patients with syphilis who are immunocompromised or who have an HIV infection or AIDS may have aty&#173;pi&#173;cal or more fulminant ocular disease patterns. Optic neuritis and neuroretinitis are more common in the initial pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of &#173;these patients, and disease recurrences may be noted even &#173;after appropriate antibacterial therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Neuro-&#173;ophthalmic manifestations of syphilis include the Argyll Robertson pupil, ocular motor nerve palsies, optic neuropathy, and retrobulbar optic neuritis, all of which appear most often in patients with tertiary syphilis or in neurosyphilis (see BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for further discussion).</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diagnosis of syphilitic uveitis is supported by history and clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion. It is confirmed by serologic testing. Primary syphilis may occasionally be diagnosed by direct visualization of spirochetes with dark-&#173;field microscopy and by direct fluo&#173;rescent antibody tests of lesion exudates or tissue. Serodiagnosis is based on the results of both nontreponemal and treponemal antigen tests. Nontreponemal tests include the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) evaluations. Treponemal tests include the fluo&#173;rescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-&#173;ABS) assay and the microhemagglutination assay for <span class="italic">T pallidum</span> antibodies (MHA-TP).</p>

			<p class="h3">Nontreponemal and treponemal antigen tests</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nontreponemal antibody titers correlate with disease activity, generally increasing during primary or secondary syphilis and decreasing when the spirochetes are not active, such as during latent syphilis or &#173;after adequate antibiotic treatment. They are useful barometers for monitoring therapy for both systemic and ocular disease. Results of treponemal tests become positive during the secondary stage of syphilis and remain positive throughout the patient’s life; as such, they are not useful in assessing therapeutic response.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Testing for HIV infection should be performed in all patients with syphilis, given the high frequency of coinfection. As a result of passive transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) across the placenta, VDRL and FTA-&#173;ABS IgG test results are positive among infants born to &#173;mothers with syphilis. For this reason, serodiagnosis of congenital syphilis is made using the immunoglobulin M (IgM) FTA-&#173;ABS test, which indicates infection in the infant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">False-&#173;positive nontreponemal test results occur in a variety of medical conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), leprosy, advanced age, intravenous drug abuse, bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, vaccinations, infectious mononucleosis, HIV infection, aty&#173;pi&#173;cal pneumonia, malaria, pregnancy, rickettsial infections, and other spirochetal infections (eg, Lyme disease). False-&#173;positive treponemal test results are rare (1%–2%) and may occur with other spirochetal infections (Lyme disease, leptospirosis), autoimmune disease (SLE, primary biliary cirrhosis, and rheumatoid arthritis), leprosy, malaria, and advanced age. Although nontreponemal tests are appropriate for screening large populations with a relatively lower risk for syphilis, specific treponemal tests, such as FTA-&#173;ABS, have a higher predictive value in patients with uveitis and should be used in conjunction with nontreponemal tests in diagnosing and treating ocular syphilis. Both the false-&#173;positive and false-&#173;negative rates of serologic testing may be greater in HIV-&#173;infected patients. A lumbar puncture with examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is warranted in &#173;every case of syphilitic uveitis. A positive CSF VDRL result and/or pleocytosis is diagnostic for neurosyphilis, as CSF VDRL may be nonreactive in some cases of active CNS involvement. Although less specific, the CSF FTA-&#173;ABS test is highly sensitive and may be useful in excluding neurosyphilis. Follow-up for patients with chorioretinitis and abnormal CSF findings requires spinal fluid examination &#173;every 6 months &#173;until the cell count, protein, and VDRL results return to normal.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Other techniques</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Other tests such as specific enzyme-&#173;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–&#173;based DNA amplification techniques are being used with increasing frequency in the serodiagnosis of syphilis. Given their high sensitivity and specificity, &#173;these techniques, particularly PCR analy&#173;sis of intraocular and/or cerebrospinal fluids, may be valuable in confirming the diagnosis in aty&#173;pi&#173;cal cases.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Parenteral penicillin G is the preferred treatment for all stages of syphilis (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;10-1</span>). Although the formulation, dose, route of administration, and duration of therapy vary with the stage of the disease, patients with syphilitic uveitis should be managed as though they have neurosyphilis, regardless of immune status. The current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation for the treatment of neurosyphilis is 18–24 million units (MU) of aqueous crystalline penicillin G per day, administered as 3–4 MU intravenously &#173;every 4 hours or as a continuous infusion for 10–14 days. This may be supplemented with intramuscular benzathine penicillin G, 2.4 MU weekly for 3 weeks. Alternatively, neurosyphilis may be treated with 2.4 MU/day of intramuscular procaine penicillin plus probenecid 500&#160;mg 4 times a day, both for 10–14 days or with &#173;either intramuscular or intravenous ceftriaxone 2&#160;g daily for 10–14 days.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The recommended treatment regimen for congenital syphilis in infants during the first months of life is intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G, 100,000–150,000 units/kg/day, administered intravenously as 50,000 units/kg/dose &#173;every 12 hours during the first 7 days of life and &#173;every 8 hours thereafter, for a total of 10 days. Alternatively, procaine penicillin G, 50,000 units/kg/dose, may be administered intramuscularly in a single daily dose for 10 days.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Penicillin remains the first choice for the treatment of neurosyphilis, congenital infection, or disease in pregnant &#173;women or patients coinfected with HIV. Patients with penicillin allergy may occasionally require desensitization and then treatment with penicillin. Alternative treatments in penicillin-&#173;allergic patients who show no signs of neurosyphilis and who are HIV-&#173;seronegative include doxycycline or tetracycline. Ceftriaxone and chloramphenicol have been reported to be effective alternatives in patients with ocular syphilis who are allergic to penicillin.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients should be monitored for the development of the Jarisch-&#173;Herxheimer reaction, a hypersensitivity response of the host to treponemal antigens that are released in large numbers as spirochetes are killed during the first 24 hours of treatment. Patients pres&#173;ent with constitutional symptoms, such as fever, chills, hypotension, tachycardia, and malaise, but they may also experience concomitant worsening of intraocular inflammation that may require local and/or systemic corticosteroids. In most cases, however, supportive care and observation are sufficient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Topical, periocular, and/or systemic corticosteroids, &#173;under appropriate antibiotic cover, may be useful adjuncts for treating the anterior and posterior segment inflammation associated with syphilitic uveitis. According to the CDC, syphilis is designated a nationally “notifiable” disease; thus, appropriate health authorities should be notified according to local regulations. Fi&#173;nally, the sexual contacts of the patient must be identified and treated, as a high percentage of &#173;these individuals are at risk for acquiring and transmitting this disease.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-10">Lyme Disease</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-&#173;borne illness in the United States. It has protean systemic manifestations and is caused by the spirochete <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi</span>, but intraocular inflammation is rare<span class="italic">.</span> Animal reservoirs include deer, &#173;horses, cows, rodents, birds, cats, and dogs. The spirochete is transmitted to &#173;humans through the bite of infected ticks, <span class="italic">Ixodes scapularis</span> in the northeast, mid-&#173;Atlantic, and midwestern United States and <span class="italic">Ixodes pacificus</span> in the western United States. Numbers of reported cases of LD have been increasing steadily in the United States, recently peaking at almost 40,000&#160;in 2015. The disease affects men (53%) slightly more often than &#173;women and has a bimodal distribution, with peaks in &#173;children aged 5–14&#160;years and in adults aged 50–59&#160;years. Whites are affected more commonly than are other races. &#173;There is a seasonal variation, with most cases occurring between May and August. Lyme disease may be found worldwide, but outside the United States it is caused by dif&#173;fer&#173;ent species of <span class="italic">Borrelia,</span> such as <span class="italic">B afzelii</span> and <span class="italic">B garinii.</span></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Clinical Features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinical manifestations of LD are divided into 3 stages; ocular findings vary within each stage.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Stage 1</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most characteristic feature of stage 1, or local disease, is a macular rash known as <span class="italic">erythema chronicum migrans</span> at the site of the tick bite; it appears within 2–28 days in ~70% of patients, forming a “bull’s-eye” lesion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-6</span>). Constitutional symptoms appear at this stage and include fever, malaise, fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias.</p>
			<p class="h3">Stage 2</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Stage 2, or disseminated disease, occurs several weeks to 4 months &#173;after exposure. Spiro&#173;chetes spread hematogenously to the skin, CNS, joints, heart, and eyes. A secondary erythema chronicum migrans rash may appear at sites remote from the tick bite. Left untreated, up to 80% of patients with erythema chronicum migrans develop joint manifestations, most commonly monoarthritis or oligoarthritis involving the large joints, typically the knee (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-7</span>). Joint involvement may be the only clinical manifestation of LD in &#173;children, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis must be considered in the differential diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Neurologic involvement, which occurs in up to 40% of patients, may include meningitis, encephalitis, painful radiculitis, or unilateral or bilateral Bell palsy. In endemic areas, as many as 25% of new-&#173;onset cranial nerve VII palsies may be attributed to <span class="italic">B burgdorferi</span> infection.</p>
			<p class="h3">Stage 3</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most frequent systemic manifestation of stage 3, or per&#173;sis&#173;tent disease, which occurs more than 5 months &#173;after the initial infection, is episodic arthritis that may become chronic. Chronic arthritis has been associated with HLA-&#173;DR4 and -&#173;DR2 haplotypes in North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca; individuals expressing HLA-&#173;DR4 have a poorer response to antibiotics. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, a bluish red lesion on the extremities that may pro&#173;gress to fibrous bands and nodules, can occur in some patients, as may chronic neurologic syndromes such as neuropsychiatric disease, radiculopathy, chronic fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and memory loss.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ocular Involvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The spectrum of ocular findings in patients with LD varies with disease stage. The most common ocular manifestation of early stage 1 disease is a follicular conjunctivitis, which occurs in approximately 11% of patients; less commonly pres&#173;ent is episcleritis (see BCSC Section&#160;1, <span class="italic">Update on General Medicine,</span> and Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for further discussion and the differential diagnosis).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intraocular inflammatory disease is reported most often in stage 2 and, less frequently, in stage 3 disease; it may manifest as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. Intermediate uveitis is one of the most common intraocular pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions. Vitritis may be severe and accompanied by a granulomatous anterior chamber reaction, papillitis, neuroretinitis, choroiditis, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, and exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-8)</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A distinct clinical entity of peripheral multifocal choroiditis has been described in patients with LD; it is characterized by multiple, small, round, punched-&#173;out lesions associated with vitritis, similar to &#173;those pres&#173;ent in sarcoidosis. Choroidal involvement may lead to pigment epithelial clumping resembling the inflammatory changes that occur with syphilis or rubella. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, found in association with peripheral multifocal choroiditis or vasculitic branch ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion, may be more common than previously known.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Neuro-&#173;ophthalmic manifestations include involvement of multiple cranial nerves (II, III, IV, V, VI, and, most commonly, VII) unilaterally or bilaterally, &#173;either sequentially or si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously. Optic nerve findings include optic neuritis, papilledema associated with meningitis, and most commonly papillitis. Horner syndrome has also been reported.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Keratitis is the most common ocular manifestation of stage 3 disease; much less common is episcleritis. Both may pres&#173;ent months to years &#173;after the onset of infection. Typically, infiltrates are bilateral, patchy, focal, and stromal; subepithelial infiltrates with indistinct borders, peripheral keratitis with stromal edema, and corneal neovascularization can also occur. The keratitis is thought to represent an immune phenomenon rather than an infectious pro&#173;cess &#173;because it responds to topical corticosteroids alone.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diagnosis of LD is made on the basis of history, clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, and supportive serology. In the appropriate clinical context, erythema chronicum migrans is diagnostic. However, interpreting serologic data is problematic &#173;because of the lack of standardization of the values by which a positive test result is defined—&#173;the degree of cross-&#173;reactivity with other spirochetes—&#173;thus leading to frequent false-&#173;positive and false-&#173;negative test results. For the diagnosis of active disease or previous infection, the CDC recommends ELISA testing for IgM and IgG, followed by Western immunoblot testing. Assays based on PCR have been used successfully to amplify both genomic and plasmid <span class="italic">B burgdorferi</span> DNA from a variety of tissues, including ocular fluids, with the highest yields obtained from the skin.</p>

			<p class="h2">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Table&#160;10-2 lists treatment recommendations for the vari&#173;ous clinical manifestations of LD. For patients with ocular involvement, the route and duration of antibiotic treatment have not been established; however, as with syphilitic uveitis, intraocular inflammation associated with LD is best regarded as a manifestation of CNS involvement and warrants careful neurologic evaluation, including a lumbar puncture. Patients with severe posterior segment manifestations—&#173;and certainly &#173;those with confirmed CNS involvement—&#173;require intravenous antibiotic therapy with neurologic dosing regimens. Likewise, patients with less-&#173;severe disease that responds incompletely or relapses when oral antibiotics are discontinued should prob&#173;ably be treated with intravenous drugs as outlined in Table 10-2. Patients with Lyme carditis or who have atrioventricular block should be admitted to the hospital, monitored, and administered treatment with intravenous antibiotics.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;After the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy, anterior segment inflammation may be treated with topical corticosteroids and mydriatics. The use of systemic corticosteroids has been described as part of the management of LD; however, the routine use of corticosteroids is controversial, as it has been associated with an increase in antibiotic treatment failures. As with syphilis, the Jarisch-&#173;Herxheimer reaction may complicate antibiotic therapy. Patients may become reinfected with <span class="italic">B burgdorferi</span> &#173;after successful antibiotic therapy, especially in endemic areas, or they may experience a more severe or chronic course due to concomitant babesiosis (an intraerythrocytic parasitic infection caused by protozoa of the genus <span class="italic">Babesia,</span> which is also transmitted by <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> species ticks) or &#173;human granulocytic anaplasmosis (previously known as <span class="italic">&#173;human granulocytic ehrlichiosis)</span> and require retreatment with antibiotics. Prevention strategies include avoiding tick-&#173;infested habitats, using tick repellents, wearing protective outer garments, removing ticks promptly, and reducing tick populations.</p>

			<p class="h1">Leptospirosis</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection with a worldwide distribution. It occurs most frequently in tropical and subtropical regions and is caused by the gram-&#173;negative spirochete <span class="italic">Leptospira interrogans.</span> The natu&#173;ral reservoirs for <span class="italic">Leptospira</span> organisms include livestock, &#173;horses, dogs, and rodents, which excrete the organism in their urine. &#173;Humans contract the disease upon exposure to contaminated soil or &#173;water; thus, groups at risk include agricultural workers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery and slaughter&#173;house workers, and military personnel, as well as swimmers, triathletes, and whitewater raf&#173;ters. The disease is not known to spread from person to person, but maternal–&#173;fetal transmission might occur infrequently. It is very rare in the United States, with 100–150 cases being identified annually, half of them in Puerto Rico. Globally, 1 million &#173;people are estimated to be infected each year, with almost 60,000 deaths. Since 2013, leptospirosis has been reinstated as a nationally notifiable disease in the United States.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Leptospirosis is frequently a biphasic disease, with the initial, or leptospiremic, phase following an incubation period of 2–4 weeks heralded by the abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, myalgias, vomiting, and diarrhea. Severe septicemic leptospirosis, also known as <span class="italic">Weil disease,</span> is characterized by renal and hepatocellular dysfunction; it is rare (occurs in 10%) but can be fatal in 30%. Leptospires may be isolated from the blood and CSF but are cleared rapidly as the disease progresses to the second, or immune, phase of the illness, which is characterized by meningitis, leptospiruria, cranial nerve palsies, myelitis, and uveitis. The organism may persist for longer periods of time in immunologically privileged sites such as the brain and the eye.</p>

			<p class="h2">Ocular Involvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular involvement can occur in both the leptospiremic and immune phases, but &#173;there is frequently a prolonged interval between systemic and ocular disease. Circumcorneal conjunctival hyperemia is the earliest and most common sign of ocular leptospirosis. The development of intraocular inflammation, which can range from mild anterior uveitis to panuveitis with ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis (in 10%–44% of patients), is the more serious, potentially vision-&#173;threatening complication.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The differential diagnosis includes HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;associated uveitis, idiopathic pars planitis, Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease, Eales disease, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and syphilis. Appropriate history and laboratory evaluation help distinguish &#173;these entities from leptospiral uveitis. A definitive diagnosis requires isolation of the organism from bodily fluids. A presumptive diagnosis is made on the basis of serologic assays. Rapid serologic assays such as ELISA and complement-&#173;fixation tests for the detection of IgM antibodies against leptospiral antigens are highly sensitive and specific, and PCR-&#173;based assays are &#173;under evaluation. Lepto&#173;spirosis may cause a false-&#173;positive result on RPR or FTA-&#173;ABS tests.</p>
			<p class="h2">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intravenous antibiotic therapy with 1.5 MU of penicillin G &#173;every 6 hours or oral doxycycline, 100&#160;mg twice daily for 1 week, may be used for mild or moderate cases. It is not known &#173;whether systemic antibiotic treatment is protective with re&#173;spect to long-&#173;term complications such as uveitis. However, systemic antibiotic treatment should be considered for ocular disease that occurs even months &#173;after onset of the acute systemic disease. In addition, topical, periocular, or systemic corticosteroids, together with mydriatic and cycloplegic drugs, are routinely used to suppress intraocular inflammation. The visual prognosis of leptospiral uveitis is quite favorable despite severe panuveal inflammation.</p>

Although ocular involvement in patients with <span class="italic">N asteroides</span> infection is rare, ocular disease may be the presenting prob&#173;lem in this potentially lethal but treatable systemic disease characterized by pneumonia and disseminated abscesses. The responsible organism is commonly found in soil, and initial infection occurs by ingestion or inhalation, causing an insidious inflammation.

			<p class="h2">Ocular Involvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular involvement occurs by hematogenous spread of the bacteria, and symptoms may vary from the mild pain and redness of anterior uveitis to the severe pain and decreased vision of panophthalmitis. Nocardia infection can affect essentially any ocular structure, including periorbital tissue and the adnexae. Findings range from keratitis, necrotizing scleritis, or an isolated, unilateral choroidal or subret&#173;i&#173;nal mass (abscess) with minimal vitritis to panuveitis with anterior chamber cell and flare, vitritis, and multiple choroidal abscesses with overlying ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment mimicking fungal endophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnosis</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-11">Tuberculosis</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular involvement caused by tuberculosis (TB) is uncommon in the United States. In the last 6 de&#173;cades, the TB incidence rate in the United States has decreased from 52.6 cases per 100,000 persons in 1953 to 2.9 cases per 100,000&#160;in 2016. Worldwide, however, TB remains an impor&#173;tant systemic infectious disease, with more than 10.4 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths reported annually. Nearly one-&#173;third of the world’s population is infected, and 95% of cases occur in resource-&#173;limited countries.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the United States, impor&#173;tant risk &#173;factors include ethnicity and country of birth, with increased prevalence among Asians, African Americans, and Hispanics, when compared to non-&#173;Hispanic whites. Diabetes mellitus and coninfection with HIV have also emerged as risk &#173;factors, in addition to substance abuse or residence in congregate settings, including correctional facilities, military barracks, homeless shelters, refugee camps, dormitories, and nursing homes, among &#173;others. Although the frequency of ocular disease parallels the prevalence of TB in general, it remains relatively uncommon both in endemic areas and among institutionalized populations with unequivocal systemic disease. In the United States, the incidence of uveitis attributable to TB at a large tertiary care fa&#173;cil&#173;i&#173;ty was 0.6%, whereas at major referral centers in India, it ranged from 0.6% to 10%. In similar institutions in Japan and Saudi Arabia, the incidence was 7.9% and 10.5%, respectively.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> is an acid-&#173;fast–&#173;staining, obligate aerobe most commonly transmitted by aerosolized droplets. The organism has an affinity for highly oxygenated tissues. Tuberculous lesions are commonly found in the apices of the lungs as well as in the choroid, which has the highest blood flow rate in the body. Systemic infection may occur primarily, due to recent exposure; in 90% of patients, however, it occurs secondarily from reactivation of the disease with immune compromise. Widespread hematogenous dissemination of TB, known as <span class="italic">miliary disease,</span> likewise occurs most often in immunocompromised persons.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pulmonary TB develops in approximately 80% of patients, whereas extrapulmonary disease occurs in about 20%, with one-&#173;half of &#173;these patients having a normal-&#173;appearing chest radiograph and up to 20% having a negative result on the purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test. Patients coinfected with HIV pres&#173;ent more often with extrapulmonary disease, the frequency of which increases with deteriorating immune function. Only 10% of infected individuals develop symptomatic disease; one-&#173;half of &#173;these manifest illness within the first 1–2&#160;years. Most, however, remain infected but asymptomatic. The classic pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of symptomatic disease—&#173;fever, night sweats, and weight loss—&#173;occurs in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary infection. This fact is impor&#173;tant to keep in mind when conducting a review of systems in patients suspected of tuberculous uveitis &#173;because histologically proven intraocular TB has been found in asymptomatic patients as well as in patients with extrapulmonary disease.</p>

			<p class="h2">Ocular Involvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ocular manifestations of TB may result from &#173;either active infection or an immunologic reaction to the organism. External ocular and anterior segment findings include scleritis, phlyctenulosis, interstitial keratitis, corneal infiltrates, anterior chamber and iris nodules, and isolated granulomatous anterior uveitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-9</span>); the last is exceedingly uncommon in the absence of posterior segment disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tuberculous uveitis is classically a chronic granulomatous disease that may affect the anterior and/or posterior segments. It may be replete with mutton-&#173;fat keratic precipitates, iris nodules, posterior synechiae, and secondary glaucoma, although nongranulomatous uveitis may also occur. Patients typically experience a waxing and waning course, with accumulation of vitreous opacities and macular edema (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-10</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Choroidal involvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Disseminated choroiditis is the most common pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion and is characterized by multiple deep, discrete, yellowish lesions between 0.5&#160;mm and 3.0&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter and numbering from 5 to several hundred (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-11</span>). &#173;These lesions, or tubercles, are located predominantly in the posterior pole and may be accompanied by disc edema, nerve fiber layer hemorrhages, and varying degrees of vitritis and granulomatous anterior uveitis. Alternatively, they may pres&#173;ent as a single, focal, large, elevated choroidal mass (tuberculoma) that varies in size from 4&#160;mm to 14&#160;mm and may be accompanied by neurosensory ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment and macular star formation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-12</span>). Choroidal tubercles may be one of the earliest signs of disseminated disease and are more commonly observed among immunocompromised hosts. On FA, active choroidal lesions display early hypo-hyperfluorescence with late leakage, and cicatricial lesions show early blocked fluorescence with late staining. ICG angiography reveals early-&#173; and late-&#173;stage hypofluorescence corresponding to the choroidal lesions, which are frequently more numerous than &#173;those seen on FA or clinical examination (see Fig 10-12). Other manifestations include multifocal choroiditis, frequently with a serpiginoid patter (multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis, also called <span class="italic">serpiginous-&#173;like choroiditis;</span> <span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-13)</span>. In patients with HIV/AIDS, tuberculous choroiditis may pro&#173;gress despite effective antituberculous therapy.</p>
			<p class="h3">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal involvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal involvement in TB is usually secondary to extension of the choroidal disease or an immunologic response to mycobacteria and should be differentiated from Eales disease, a peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal perivasculitis that pres&#173;ents in other&#173;wise healthy young men aged 20–40&#160;years with recurrent, unilateral ret&#173;i&#173;nal and vitreous hemorrhage and subsequent involvement of the fellow eye. The disease may be associated, at least in part, to some degree of tuberculin hypersensitivity. Interestingly a few studies employing PCR-&#173;based assays have detected <span class="italic">M tuberculosis</span> DNA from aqueous, vitreous, and epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membranes of some patients with Eales disease. Periphlebitis is commonly observed in this setting, and may be accompanied by venous occlusion, peripheral nonperfusion, neovascularization (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-14</span>), and eventual development of tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment in some cases (see also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;12</span>, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous,</span> for additional discussion of Eales disease). Other posterior segment findings of TB include subret&#173;i&#173;nal abscess, CNV, optic neuritis, and panophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Definitive diagnosis of TB requires direct evidence of mycobacteria in bodily fluids or tissues. In many cases of ocular TB, this confirmation is not pos&#173;si&#173;ble, and the diagnosis is instead presumptive, based on indirect evidence. A positive result on a tuberculin skin test using PPD (purified protein derivative of <span class="italic">Mycobacterium bovis)</span> test or an interferon-&#173;gamma release assay is indicative of prior exposure to TB but not necessarily of active systemic or ocular infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the United States, an induration of 5&#160;mm or more, read 48–72 hours &#173;after intradermal injection of the standard 5-tuberculin-&#173;unit (5-TU), or intermediate-&#173;strength, test dose is considered a positive result in individuals with HIV infection, &#173;those exposed to active TB, or &#173;those whose radiographs are consistent with healed tuberculous lesions. An induration of 10&#160;mm or more is considered indicative of a positive result for other high-&#173;risk individuals, including patients with diabetes mellitus or renal failure, &#173;those on immunomodulatory therapy (IMT), health care workers, and recent immigrants from high-&#173;prevalence countries. Patients with no known risks for tuberculosis are considered to have a positive test result if induration is 15&#160;mm or more.</p>
			<p class="body-text">False-&#173;negative skin testing results may occur at a rate of up to 25% &#173;because of patients with profound acute illness or immune compromise, which can stem from corticosteroid use, advanced age, poor nutrition, and sarcoidosis. False-&#173;positive results may arise from patients infected with aty&#173;pi&#173;cal mycobacteria, immunized with BCG vaccine, and treated with intraluminal BCG injections for bladder carcinoma. Individuals recently immunized with BCG vaccine may have an induration mea&#173;sur&#173;ing around 10&#160;mm at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, but the reaction is usually not sustained and tends to decrease with time compared with the reaction following the skin test &#173;after more recent systemic TB exposure. A Bayesian analy&#173;sis predicts that routine screening of uveitis patients for TB has a low probability of detecting disease in settings where the prevalence of TB is low. It is recommended, therefore, that testing be selectively used for patients in whom the index of suspicion has been heightened by a careful history, review of systems, and clinical examination. Testing for TB is required in patients being considered for treatment with tumor necrosis &#173;factor inhibitors or other biologic agents.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A history of recent exposure to TB or a positive TB test result warrants a concerted search for systemic infection, using chest imaging (radiography, computer-&#173;assisted tomography and positron emission tomography scanning), and/or microbiologic analy&#173;sis of sputum, urine, or gastric aspirates, or a cervical lymph node biopsy for acid-&#173;fast bacilli. Failure to demonstrate systemic disease does not, however, exclude the possibility of intraocular infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For cases of suspected ocular TB in which the results of the above-&#173;mentioned testing for systemic infection are negative, the patient is asymptomatic, or the infection is thought to be extrapulmonary, definitive diagnosis may require intraocular fluid analy&#173;sis or tissue biopsy. Nucleic acid amplification techniques, with &#173;either transcription-&#173;mediated amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA or PCR amplification of unique DNA sequences of <span class="italic">M tuber</span><span class="italic">culosis,</span> have been successfully used in some cases to diagnose intraocular TB, though the yield may be low &#173;because of a thick cell wall and possibly low bacterial load in the vitreous. Chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal biopsy used in conjunction with PCR testing and routine histologic examination may be necessary in aty&#173;pi&#173;cal cases where the differential diagnosis and therapeutic options are widely divergent. Recently, antibodies against purified cord &#173;factor, the most antigenic and abundant cell wall component of tubercle bacilli, have been detected by ELISA and may be useful for rapid serodiagnosis of pulmonary TB, in addition to providing supportive data for the diagnosis of ocular infection.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Systemic antitubercular therapy is clearly indicated for patients with uveitis whose TB test results have recently converted to positive, patients with an abnormal-&#173;appearing chest radio&#173;graph suggestive of tuberculosis, or persons with positive mycobacterial culture or PCR results to <span class="italic">M tuberculosis.</span> Multidrug therapy is recommended &#173;because of the increasing incidence of re&#173;sis&#173;tance to isoniazid as well as adherence prob&#173;lems associated with long-&#173;term therapy. &#173;These prob&#173;lems, together with the extremely slow growth rate of TB, contribute to the acquisition of multidrug-&#173;resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB). Patients at risk for MDRTB include nonadherent patients receiving single-&#173;drug therapy; mi&#173;grant or indigent populations; immunocompromised patients, including &#173;those with HIV infection; and recent immigrants from countries where isoniazid and rifampin are available over the &#173;counter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In brief, treatment entails an initial 2-month induction course of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol administered daily, followed by a continuation phase of 4–7 months with 2 drugs. More than 95% of immunocompetent patients may be successfully treated with a full course of therapy, provided they adhere to this regimen. Directly observed therapy plays a crucial role in ensuring this success and is now the standard of care in the treatment of tuberculosis. Treatment protocols have been standardized and are available from the CDC.</p>
			<p class="body-text">More difficult is the treatment approach to patients with uveitis consistent with TB, normal chest radiograph appearance, and positive TB test result. In this situation, a diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB may be entertained and treatment initiated, particularly in cases with medically unresponsive uveitis or other findings supportive of the diagnosis, such as recent exposure to or inadequate treatment of the disease, a large area of induration, or skin test result recently converted to positive. Topical and even systemic corticosteroids may be used in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy to treat the inflammatory component of the disease. &#173;Because intensive corticosteroid treatment administered without appropriate coverage with antituberculosis treatment may lead to progressive worsening of ocular disease, any patient suspected of harboring TB should undergo appropriate testing before beginning such therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with a positive TB test result or abnormal chest film appearance for whom systemic corticosteroid treatment is being considered, or patients who have received corticosteroids for longer than 2 weeks at doses greater than 15&#160;mg/day, may benefit from prophylactic treatment with isoniazid for 6 months to 1 year based on infectious disease specialist evaluation. Likewise, patients with latent TB in whom IMT (particularly with tumor necrosis &#173;factor inhibitors) is being considered should be treated with isoniazid prophylaxis beginning at least 3 weeks before the first administration.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Bartonella henselae</span> (formerly <span class="italic">Rochalimaea henselae)</span>, a small, fastidious, gram-&#173;negative rod, initially isolated from the tissue of patients with bacillary angiomatosis of AIDS, is now known to be the principal etiologic agent of cat-&#173;scratch disease (CSD) and is associated with an expanding spectrum of ocular manifestations. Cat-&#173;scratch disease is a feline-&#173;associated zoonotic disease found worldwide, with an estimated annual incidence rate in the United States of 9.3 cases per 100,000 persons. The highest age-&#173;specific incidence is among &#173;children younger than 10&#160;years of age. Cats are the primary mammalian reservoir of <span class="italic">B henselae</span> and <span class="italic">B quintana,</span> and the cat flea is an impor&#173;tant vector for the transmission of the organism among cats. The disease follows a seasonal pattern, occurring predominantly in the fall and winter, and is most prevalent in the southern states, California, and Hawaii. The disease is transmitted to &#173;humans by the scratches, licks, and bites of domestic cats, particularly kittens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic manifestations of CSD include a mild to moderate flulike illness associated with regional adenopathy that usually precedes the ocular manifestations of the disease. An erythematous papule, vesicle, or pustule usually forms at the primary site of cutaneous injury 3–10 days &#173;after primary inoculation and 1–2 weeks before the onset of lymphadenopathy and constitutional symptoms. Less commonly, more severe and disseminated disease may develop that is associated with encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, osteo&#173;myelitis, hepatosplenic disease, pneumonia, and pleural and pericardial effusions.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Ocular Involvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular involvement, which occurs in 5%–10% of patients with CSD, includes Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome (unilateral granulomatous conjunctivitis and regional lymphadenopathy) in approximately 5% of patients and a wide array of posterior segment and neuro-&#173;ophthalmic findings. Entities to be considered in the differential diagnosis of Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome include tularemia, tuberculosis, syphilis, sporotrichosis, and acute <span class="italic">Chlamydia trachomatis</span> infection (see also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;8</span>, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for discussion on Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The best-known posterior segment manifestation of <span class="italic">B henselae</span> infection is neuro&#173;retinitis, a constellation of findings that includes abrupt vision loss, unilateral optic disc swelling, and macular star formation. This syndrome, formerly known as <span class="italic">idiopathic stellate maculopathy</span> and &#173;later renamed <span class="italic">Leber idiopathic stellate neuroretinitis,</span> is now known to be caused by <span class="italic">B henselae</span> infection in approximately two-&#173;thirds of cases. It occurs in 1%–2% of patients with CSD. Focal or multifocal retinitis may also be identified. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;10-3</span> lists other entities that may cause neuroretinitis. Visual acuity loss varies between 20/25 and 20/200 or worse and follows the onset of constitutional symptoms by approximately 2–3 weeks. Although the pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion is most often unilateral, bilateral cases of neuroretinitis have been reported and are frequently asymmetric. Optic disc edema, associated with peripapillary serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, has been observed 2–4 weeks before the appearance of the macular star and may be a sign of systemic <span class="italic">B henselae</span> infection. The development of the macular star is variable (<span class="xref-figure">Fig </span><span class="xref-figure">10-15</span>) and may be partial or incomplete, usually resolving in approximately 8–12 weeks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with <span class="italic">Bartonella-&#173;</span>associated neuroretinitis may exhibit some degree of anterior chamber inflammation and vitritis. Discrete, focal, or multifocal ret&#173;i&#173;nal and/or choroidal lesions mea&#173;sur&#173;ing 50–300 µm are common posterior segment findings. Both arterial and venous occlusive disease, as well as localized neurosensory macular detachments, have been described in association with focal retinitis. Other posterior segment ocular complications include epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membranes, inflammatory mass of the optic nerve head, peripapillary angiomatosis, intermediate uveitis, ret&#173;i&#173;nal white dot syndromes, orbital abscess, isolated optic disc swelling, and panuveitis. Immunosuppressed individuals may display a ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasoproliferative response, leading to single/multiple angiomatoid lesions involving ret&#173;i&#173;na/choroid.</p>

			<p class="h2">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A diagnosis of CSD is made on the basis of characteristic clinical features together with confirmatory serologic testing. The indirect fluo&#173;rescent antibody assay for the detection of serum anti–&#173;<span class="italic">B henselae</span> antibodies is 88% sensitive and 94% specific, with titers of greater than 1:64 considered positive. Enzyme immunoassays with a sensitivity for IgG of 86%–95% and a specificity of 96%, together with Western blot analy&#173;sis, have also been developed. A single positive indirect fluo&#173;rescent antibody or enzyme immunoassay titer for IgG or IgM is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of CSD. Other diagnostic approaches include bacterial cultures, which may require several weeks for colonies to become apparent; skin testing, which has a sensitivity of up to 100% and a specificity of up to 98%; and PCR-&#173;based techniques that target the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene or <span class="italic">B henselae</span> DNA.</p>

			<p class="h2">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Definitive treatment guidelines have not emerged for CSD &#173;because it is a self-&#173;limiting illness in many cases, with an overall excellent systemic prognosis. Visual outcomes may be variable, depending on location/severity of intraocular inflammation. A variety of antibiotics, including doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, rifampin, trimethoprim-&#173;sulfamethoxazole, and gentamycin, have been used in the treatment of more severe systemic or ocular manifestations,&#160;even though their efficacy has not been demonstrated conclusively. A typical regimen for immunocompetent patients older than 8&#160;years consists of doxycycline, 100&#160;mg orally twice daily for 4–6 weeks. For more severe infections, doxycycline may be given intravenously or used in combination with rifampin, 300&#160;mg orally twice daily; among immunocompromised individuals, this treatment is extended for 4 months. &#173;Children with CSD may be treated with azithromycin, as safety of ciprofloxacin in individuals younger than 18&#160;years is of concern. The efficacy of oral corticosteroids on the course of systemic and ocular disease is unknown, even though &#173;these are frequently used in cases threatening the optic nerve/macula.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-17">Whipple Disease</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Whipple disease is a rare multisystem disease caused by the <span class="italic">Tropheryma whipplei</span> bacterium. It is most common in middle-&#173;aged white men. Migratory arthritis occurs in 80% of cases, and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, steatorrhea, and malabsorption, occur in 75%. Intestinal loss of protein results in pitting edema and weight loss. Cardiomyopathy and valvular disease can also occur. Central ner&#173;vous system involvement occurs in 10% of cases and results in seizures, dementia, and coma. Neuro-&#173;ophthalmic signs can include cranial nerve palsies, nystagmus, and ophthalmoplegia. Some patients develop a progressive supranuclear palsy–&#173;like condition (see also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;5</span>, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for discussion on neuro-&#173;ophthalmologic manifestations of Whipple disease).</p>
			<p class="h2">Ocular Involvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intraocular involvement is rare and occurs in less than 5% of cases. Patients can pres&#173;ent with bilateral panuveitis and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, as well as with multifocal chorioretinitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-16</span>). Both anterior uveitis and moderate vitritis are pres&#173;ent. Diffuse chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal inflammation and diffuse ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis in the perifoveal and midperipheral regions may occur. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular occlusions and ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages may result from the vasculitis. Optic disc edema and, &#173;later, optic atrophy may occur. Unusual granular, crystalline deposits on the iris, capsular bag, and intraocular lens have also been reported.</p>

			<p class="h2">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Untreated Whipple disease can be fatal. Systemic trimethoprim-&#173;sulfamethoxazole is the preferred treatment. Patients allergic to sulfonamides may be treated with ceftriaxone, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol. Treatment duration may vary from 1 to 3 months, but relapses occur in 30% of cases, necessitating prolonged (up to 1 year) treatment.
