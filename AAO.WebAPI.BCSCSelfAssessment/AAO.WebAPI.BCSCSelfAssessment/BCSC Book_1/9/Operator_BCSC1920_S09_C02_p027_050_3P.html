			<p class="h1">Definitions</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">antigen</span> refers to a substance recognized by the immune system. The term <span class="italic">epit</span><span class="italic">ope</span> refers to each specific portion of an antigen to which the immune system can respond. Antigenic epitopes exist on both native self tissues as well as foreign nonself tissues. A&#160;complex, 3-&#173;dimensional protein has multiple antigenic epitopes that the immune system can recognize as well as many other sites that remain invisible to the immune system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The adaptive immune response, unlike the innate immune response discussed in <span class="body-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>, is a learned response to highly variable but specific antigenic epitopes rather than a response to conserved patterns. The purpose of the adaptive immune system is to continuously sample antigenic epitopes, determine if they are self or nonself, and then mount an immune response to eliminate foreign antigens. Several immunologic concepts, especially &#173;those of the immune response arc, the primary adaptive immune response, and the secondary adaptive immune response, are involved in this pro&#173;cess. See <span class="body-text_xref-sidebar">Clinical Example 2-1</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Analogous to the neural reflex arc, the immune response arc—&#173;the interaction between antigen and the adaptive immune system—&#173;can be subdivided into 3 phases: afferent, pro&#173;cessing, and effector (<span class="body-text_xref-figure">Fig 2-1</span>).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Phases of the Immune Response Arc</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Afferent Phase</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The afferent phase of the immune response arc comprises the initial recognition, transport, and pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of antigenic substances to the adaptive immune system. Recognition starts with antigen-&#173;presenting cells (APCs), which are specialized cells that bind antigen at a site. &#173;After the APC receives stimulatory signals (ie, complement), phagocytosis of the antigen occurs, as discussed in <span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>. Following ingestion of antigen, APCs migrate via afferent lymphatics to lymph nodes. Afferent lymphatic channels, usually simply termed <span class="italic">lymphatics,</span> are vein-&#173;like structures that drain extracellular fluid (ie, lymph) from a site into a regional lymph node. Lymphatics serve 2 major purposes: to convey immune cells and to carry &#173;whole antigen from the site of inoculation to a lymph node. In the APCs, enzymatic digestion of proteins within endocytic vesicles produces short chains of 7–11 amino acids: the antigenic epitopic fragments. Each antigenic fragment is combined with a groove-&#173;shaped &#173;human leukocyte antigen (HLA) peptide residing on the APC surface, and this surface complex contains a unique epitope. The combination of peptide and HLA protein is recognized by the T-&#173;lymphocyte receptors CD4 and CD8. HLA molecules vary in their capacity to bind vari&#173;ous antigenic peptide fragments within their groove, and thus the HLA type determines the repertoire of peptide antigens capable of being presented to T lymphocytes. Specific HLA alleles are impor&#173;tant risk &#173;factors for certain forms of uveitis. See <span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span> for further discussion of HLA molecules and disease susceptibility.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (ie, HLA-&#173;A, -&#173;B, and -&#173;C) serve as the antigen-&#173;presenting platform for CD8<span class="body-text_symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> T lymphocytes, which are essentially &#173;cytotoxic T cells (<span class="body-text_xref-figure">Fig 2-2</span>). Class I molecules are pres&#173;ent on almost all nucleated cells and generally function to pro&#173;cess peptide antigens synthesized by the host cell. If &#173;these presented antigens are recognized as self (ie, normal host protein), no immune reaction occurs. However, if &#173;there is an alteration of the normal host peptide (termed <span class="italic">altered sel</span><span class="italic">f</span><span class="italic"> </span>), by tumor or viral peptides &#173;after host cell invasion, an immune response is initiated. A viral infection, a neoplasm, or simply a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic mutation that alters protein structure could also induce autoimmunity by stimulating an inappropriate immune response to normal host proteins.</p>
			<p class="body-text">MHC class II molecules (ie, HLA-&#173;DR, -&#173;DP, and -&#173;DQ) serve as the antigen-&#173;presenting platform for CD4<span class="body-text_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>, or <span class="italic">helper,</span> T lymphocytes (<span class="body-text_xref-figure">Fig 2–3</span>). The antigen receptor on the helper T lymphocyte can recognize peptide antigens only if the antigens are presented with class II molecules si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously. Only certain cell types express MHC class II molecules. &#173;Macrophages and dendritic cells are the most impor&#173;tant of &#173;these types, though B lymphocytes can also function as class II–&#173;dependent APCs, especially within a lymph node. Class II–&#173;dependent APCs are considered the most efficient APCs for pro&#173;cessing extracellular protein antigens; that is, antigens that have been phagocytosed from the external environment (eg, bacterial or fungal antigens).</p>
			<p class="h2">Pro&#173;cessing Phase</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The conversion of an antigenic stimulus into an immunologic response occurs through <span class="italic">priming</span> of naive B and T lymphocytes (lymphocytes that have not yet encountered their specific antigen) within lymph nodes and the spleen. This conversion is also called <span class="italic">activation,</span> or <span class="italic">sensitization,</span> of lymphocytes. Pro&#173;cessing involves regulation of the interaction between antigen and naive lymphocytes, followed by lymphocyte activation (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure">Fig 2–4</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Preconditions necessary for pro&#173;cessing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">CD4<span class="body-text--no-indent-_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> T lymphocytes are the principal cell type for immune pro&#173;cessing. &#173;These lymphocytes have a receptor that detects antigen only upon formation of a trimolecular complex consisting of an HLA molecule, a pro&#173;cessed antigen fragment, and a T-&#173;lymphocyte antigen receptor. The CD4<span class="body-text--no-indent-_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> molecule stabilizes binding and enhances signaling between the HLA complex on the APC and the T-&#173;lymphocyte receptor. When helper T lymphocytes recognize their specific antigen, they become primed and partially activated, acquiring new functional properties, including cell division, cytokine synthesis, and cell membrane expression of <span class="italic">accessory molecules,</span> such as cell-&#173;adhesion molecules and costimulatory molecules. The synthesis and release of immune cytokines, especially interleukin-2 (IL-2), by T lymphocytes is crucial for the progression of initial activation and the functional differentiation of T lymphocytes through autocrine stimulation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Helper T-&#173;lymphocyte differentiation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">At the stage of initial priming, CD4<span class="body-text--no-indent-_symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> T lymphocytes are classified as T helper-0 (Th0) cells. &#173;These cells can differentiate into functional subsets based on the pattern of cytokines to which they are exposed. Each T-&#173;helper (Th) subset produces a characteristic profile of &#173;cytokines that is regulated by the expression of subset-&#173;specific transcription &#173;factors. When the Th subsets &#173;were discovered, only 2 &#173;were defined: T helper-1 (Th1) and T helper-2 (Th2). Th1 cells secrete interferon gamma (IFN-&#173;<span class="body-text--no-indent-_greek">γ</span>), IL-2, and tumor necrosis &#173;factor <span class="body-text--no-indent-_greek">α</span> and <span class="body-text--no-indent-_greek">β</span> (TNF-&#173;<span class="body-text--no-indent-_greek">α</span>, TNF-&#173;<span class="body-text--no-indent-_greek">β</span>), whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 but not Th1 cytokines. The T-&#173;bet transcription &#173;factor directs the Th1 cytokine production. The GATA3 transcription &#173;factor regulates Th2 cytokines. The Th2 subset is involved in the clearance of extracellular pathogens and plays an impor&#173;tant role in the pathogenesis of allergic conditions such as asthma. Th1 cells participate in the elimination of intracellular pathogens as well as cell-&#173;mediated and delayed-&#173;type hypersensitivity reactions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Originally, the Th1 subset was thought to be the causal agent in autoimmunity, as transfer of antigen-&#173;specific Th1 cells produces autoimmune disease in experimental animal models, and elevated levels of IFN-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">γ</span> have been detected in areas of inflammation in vivo. Subsequently, research has suggested that other Th subsets, especially Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells, play crucial roles in chronic inflammation and autoimmunity, and &#173;there is prob&#173;ably plasticity between Th1, Th17, and Treg cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Th17 cells produce IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-24&#160;in association with several transcription &#173;factors, including retinoic acid receptor–related orphan receptor-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">γ</span>t and receptor-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">α</span>, (ROR-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">γ</span>t and -&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">α</span>). Th17 cells contribute to immunity against certain extracellular bacteria and fungi and play a role in the defense of mucosal surfaces. Dysregulation of Th17 proinflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 has been implicated in systemic inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, Sj<span class="body-text_accent">ö</span>gren syndrome, Beh<span class="body-text_accent">ç</span>et disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as in uveitis and scleritis. See Clinical Example 2-2.</p>
			<p class="body-text">T regulatory cells are identified by their simultaneous expression of CD4, CD25, and Foxp3 (a transcriptional regulator protein) and can be divided into 2 types, naturally occurring T regulatory (nTreg) cells and inducible T regulatory (iTreg) or adaptive Treg cells. The nTreg cells appear to be generated in the thymus during development. They are essential to self-&#173;tolerance, the pro&#173;cess by which autoreactive T cells are minimized and their function downregulated. Treg cells are essential for maintaining peripheral tolerance to self-&#173;antigens, thereby preventing autoimmune diseases and limiting chronic inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, Treg cells suppress excessive immune responses deleterious to the host. As a result, &#173;these cells play a central role in autoimmune diseases, transplantation tolerance, infectious diseases, allergic disease, and tumor immunity. The suppressive cytokines transforming growth &#173;factor <span class="body-text_greek">β</span> (TGF-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">β</span>) and IL-10 have been implicated as active players in the effector function of Treg cells as regulators of inflammation. An imbalance between regulatory mechanisms that inhibit the immune system and active proinflammatory mechanisms is thought to be the under&#173;lying cause of uveitis and many other immune-&#173;mediated diseases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cytokine profiles produced by &#173;these vari&#173;ous Th cell types determine subsequent immune pro&#173;cessing, B-&#173;lymphocyte antibody synthesis, and cell-&#173;mediated effector responses. For example, IFN-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">γ</span>, produced by Th1 lymphocytes, blocks the differentiation and activation of Th2 lymphocytes, whereas IL-4, produced by Th2 lymphocytes, blocks the differentiation of Th1 lymphocytes. The pro&#173;cess determining &#173;whether a Th1 or a Th2 response develops consequent to exposure to a specific antigen is not entirely understood, but presumed variables include cytokines preexisting in the microenvironment, the nature and amount of antigen encountered, and the type of APC involved. For example, IL-12, which is produced by macrophage APCs, might preferentially induce Th1 responses.</p>

			<p class="h3">B-&#173;lymphocyte activation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A major function of helper T lymphocytes is B-&#173;lymphocyte activation. B lymphocytes are responsible for producing antibodies (glycoproteins that bind to a specific antigen, the epitope). &#173;These antibodies contain an epitope-&#173;specific binding site, termed <span class="italic">paratope,</span> on the Fab (<span class="italic">f</span>ragment, <span class="italic">a</span>ntigen-&#173;<span class="italic">b</span>inding) portion of the molecule. B lymphocytes begin as naive lymphocytes, with immunoglobulins M (IgM) and D (IgD) on their cell surfaces serving as B-&#173;lymphocyte antigen receptors. Through &#173;these surface antibodies, B lymphocytes detect epitopes on intact antigens <span class="italic">without</span> the requirement of antigen pro&#173;cessing by APCs. &#173;After appropriate stimulation of the B-&#173;lymphocyte antigen receptor, helper T lymphocyte–&#173;B lymphocyte interaction occurs, leading to further B-&#173;lymphocyte activation and differentiation. B lymphocytes acquire new functional properties, such as cell division, cell surface expression of accessory molecules, and synthesis of large quantities of antibody. The terminal form of B lymphocyte differentiation is the plasma cell that secretes antibodies. Activated B lymphocytes acquire the ability to change antibody class from IgM to another class (eg, to IgG, IgA, or IgE). This class shift requires a molecular change in the immunoglobulin heavy chain, a pro&#173;cess regulated by specific cytokines released by the helper T lymphocyte. For example, treatment of an antigen-&#173;primed B lymphocyte with IFN-&#173;<span class="body-text--no-indent-_greek">γ</span> induces a switch from IgM to IgG1 production. Treatment with IL-4 induces a switch from IgM to IgE production.</p>
			<p class="h2">Effector Phase</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The purpose of the adaptive immune response (ie, the elimination or neutralization of foreign antigen) is accomplished during the effector phase. Antigen-&#173;specific effectors exist in 2 major subsets:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">T lymphocytes</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">B lymphocytes and the antibodies produced by their derived plasma cells</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Effector lymphocytes require 2 exposures to antigen for maximum effectiveness. The initial (<span class="italic">priming,</span> or <span class="italic">activation</span>) exposure occurs in the lymph node. The second <span class="italic">(restimulation)</span> exposure occurs in the peripheral tissue from which the antigen originated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Effector T lymphocytes consist primarily of 2 types, as determined by their dif&#173;fer&#173;ent responses on experimental assays and dif&#173;fer&#173;ent cell surface molecules (<span class="body-text_xref-figure">Fig 2–5</span>). <span class="italic">Delayed hypersensitivity</span> (DH) T lymphocytes usually express CD4 (and thus recognize antigen with MHC class II) and release IFN-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">γ</span> and TNF-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">β</span>. They function by encountering antigen presented by APCs in a tissue site, becoming fully activated, and releasing cytokines and mediators that recruit nonspecific, antigen-&#173;independent effector cells such as neutrophils, basophils, or monocytes (discussed in <span class="body-text_xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>). As with helper T lymphocytes, Th1 and Th2 types of DH effector cells have been identified. <span class="italic">Cytotoxic</span> T lymphocytes express CD8 and serve to kill tumor cells and virus-&#173;infected host cells. They accomplish this function through the release of cytokines (eg, IFN-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">γ</span>, TNF-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">α</span>, and TNF-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">β</span>) or specialized cytotoxic pore-&#173;forming and apoptosis-&#173;activating molecules such as perforin and granzymes. A third subset of effector lymphocytes, grouped as non-&#173;T, non-&#173;B lymphocytes, includes natu&#173;ral killer cells, lymphokine-&#173;activated cells, and killer cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Antibodies, or <span class="italic">immunoglobulins,</span> are produced by plasma cells derived from B lymphocytes &#173;after appropriate antigenic stimulation with T-&#173;lymphocyte help. Plasma cells initially secrete IgM antibodies, followed &#173;later by production of other isotypes &#173;after antibody-&#173;class switching. Antibodies are released into the efferent lymph fluid (downstream from lymph nodes), draining into the venous circulation. Once bound to their specific epitope, antibodies mediate a variety of immune effector activities, including opsonization for phagocytosis and complement activation via the classical pathway.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Immune Response Arc and Primary or Secondary Immune Response</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Immunologic memory is the most distinctive feature of adaptive immunity, with protective immunization the prototypical example of this power&#173;ful phenomenon.</p>
			<p class="h2">Differences Between Primary and Secondary Responses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The idea of an <span class="italic">anamnestic response</span> posits that the second encounter with an antigen is regulated differently from the first. During the pro&#173;cessing phase of the primary res&#173;ponse, relatively rare antigen-&#173;specific B lymphocytes (perhaps 1&#160;in 100,000 B lymphocytes) and T lymphocytes (perhaps 1&#160;in 10,000&#160;T lymphocytes) must come in contact with appropriately presented antigen. Stimulation of &#173;these cells from a completely resting and naive state then occurs, a pro&#173;cess that requires days. Following the primary response, vari&#173;ous events occur that set the stage for a subsequent rapid and robust secondary response:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Following stimulation, lymphocytes divide, dramatically increasing the population of antigen-&#173;responsive T and B lymphocytes (clonal expansion). In addition, &#173;these cells migrate to other sites of potential encounter with antigen.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Upon removal of antigen, T and B lymphocytes activated during the primary response gradually return to a resting state but are no longer naive. They retain the capacity to become reactivated within 12–24 hours of antigen exposure and thus are termed <span class="bullet-list-mid_italic">memory cells.</span></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">IgM produced during the primary response is often too large (molecular mass, 900&#160;kDa) to leak passively into a peripheral site. Following antibody-&#173;class switching, IgG or other isotypes can leak passively into a site or are already pres&#173;ent &#173;because they &#173;were produced at the site; thus, they can immediately combine with antigen and trigger a very rapid response<span class="bullet-list-mid_italic">.</span></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">In some cases, such as in mycobacterial infection, low doses of antigen may remain in the node or site, producing a chronic, low-&#173;level, continuous antigenic stimulation of T and B lymphocytes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Homing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Memory also requires that lymphocytes demonstrate a complex migratory pattern called <span class="italic">homing.</span> Thus, lymphocytes pass from the circulation into vari&#173;ous tissues, from which they subsequently depart, and then pass by way of lymphatics to reenter the circulation. Homing involves the dynamic interaction between lymphocytes and endothelial cells using multiple cell-&#173;adhesion molecules. Usually the major types of lymphocytes that migrate into tissue sites are memory lymphocytes that express higher levels of certain cell-&#173;adhesion molecules, such as the integrins, than do naive cells. In contrast, naive lymphocytes tend to migrate to lymphoid tissues, where they may meet their cognate antigen. Inflammation, however, changes the rules and breaks down homing patterns. At inflammatory sites, the volume of lymphocyte migration is far greater and se&#173;lection much less precise, although migration of memory cells or activated lymphocytes still exceeds that of naive cells.</p>

			<p class="h1">Effector Responses of Adaptive Immunity</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Traditionally, 4 mechanisms of adaptive immune-&#173;triggered inflammatory responses &#173;were recognized:</p>

Familiarity with Coombs and Gell type reactions is impor&#173;tant for interpretation of older lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture.

			<p class="h2">Antibody-&#173;Mediated Immune Effector Responses</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Structural and functional properties of antibody molecules</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Structural features of immunoglobulins</span> Five major classes of immunoglobulin (M, G, A, E, and D) exist, with 9 subclasses or isotypes (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgM, IgA1, IgA2, IgE, and IgD). The basic immunoglobulin structure is composed of 4 covalently bonded glycoprotein chains that form a monomer of approximately 150,000–180,000&#160;Da (<span class="h4-text_xref-figure">Fig 2–6</span>). Each antibody monomer contains 2 identical light chains, &#173;either kappa (<span class="h4-text_greek">κ</span>) or lambda (<span class="h4-text_greek">λ</span>), and 2 identical heavy chains from 1 of the 9 distinct subclasses of immunoglobulins; the type of heavy chain defines the specific isotype. IgM can form pentamers or hexamers in vivo, and IgA can form dimers in secretions, so the in vivo molecular size of &#173;these 2 classes is much larger than that of the &#173;others.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Antibodies contain regions called <span class="italic">domains</span> that carry out the specific functions of the antibody molecule. The Fab region (2 of which are pres&#173;ent on each molecule) contains the antigen-&#173;binding domain, called the <span class="italic">hypervariable region.</span> The opposite end of the molecule, on the heavy chain portion, contains the attachment site for effector cells (the <span class="italic">Fc portion,</span> for <span class="italic">f</span>ragment <span class="italic">c</span>rystallizable). It also contains the site of other effector functions, such as complement fixation (for IgG3) or binding to a secretory component for transportation through epithelia and secretion into tears (for IgA). <span class="body-text_xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;2-2</span> summarizes the impor&#173;tant structural differences among immunoglobulin isotypes.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Functional properties of immunoglobulins</span> Immunoglobulin isotypes differ in how they mediate effector functions of antibody activity. &#173;Human IgM and IgG3 are good complement activators, whereas IgG4 is not. Only IgA1 and IgA2 can bind the secretory component and be actively passed into mucosal secretions. The importance of &#173;these differences is that 2 antibodies with identical capacity to bind to an antigen—&#173;but of dif&#173;fer&#173;ent isotype—&#173;will produce dif&#173;fer&#173;ent effector and inflammatory outcomes.</p>
			<p class="h3">Terminology</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Clonality</span> Each B cell creates, via ge&#173;ne&#173;tic recombination, a unique Fab fragment that recognizes a single antigenic configuration. Proliferation of an individual B cell via cell division produces &#173;daughter cells that contain the same antigenic configuration. Continual clonal expansion results in a population of identical cells that recognize the same epitope, termed a <span class="h4-text_italic">monoclonal</span> population. However, a foreign substance has many antigenic epitopes. Thus, many individual B cells &#173;will recognize vari&#173;ous epitopes on the same substance, and each B cell &#173;will undergo simultaneous clonal expansion. The sum reactivity of all &#173;these antibodies is a <span class="h4-text_italic">polyclonal response</span> that characterizes the typical immune response. Modern molecular biologic techniques allow the amplification of a single B-&#173;cell clone and production of large amounts of monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic purposes. Biologic drugs such as infliximab, adalimumab, and rituximab are examples of recombinant monoclonal antibodies.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-4"><span class="h4-head">Idiotypes</span> &#173;Because they are proteins, antibodies themselves can be antigenic. Their antigenic sites are called <span class="h4-text_italic">idiotopes,</span> as distinguished from <span class="h4-text_italic">epitopes,</span> the antigenic sites on foreign molecules. Antibodies to idiotopes are called <span class="h4-text_italic">idiotypes.</span> Anti-&#173;idiotypic antibodies may function as feedback mechanisms for immune regulation and have clinical significance for modern biologic therapies. Infliximab, for example, is a monoclonal chimeric (mouse and &#173;human) antibody to TNF-&#173;<span class="h4-text_greek">α</span> that is used to treat some forms of uveitis. Efficacy of this drug may be limited by the development of anti-&#173;idiotype antibodies that neutralize the antigen binding site for TNF-&#173;<span class="h4-text_greek">α</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Infiltration of B lymphocytes into tissues and local production of antibody</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">B-&#173;lymphocyte infiltration</span> B lymphocytes can infiltrate the site of an immunologic reaction in response to per&#173;sis&#173;tent antigenic stimulus. If the pro&#173;cess becomes chronic, plasma cell formation occurs, with local production of antibody specific for the inciting antigen(s). If the antigen is known or suspected, as in the case of a presumed infection, assessment of local antibody production can serve as a diagnostic test.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Differentiation between local production of antibody and passive leakage from the blood to the intraocular compartment involves determination of the <span class="italic">Goldmann-&#173;Witmer</span> (GW) <span class="italic">coefficient.</span> This is calculated by comparing the ratio of specific IgG antibody pres&#173;ent in intraocular fluid to the total IgG level in intraocular fluid versus the ratio of specific IgG level in serum to the total IgG level in serum:</p>
			<p class="equation-single">GW coefficient <span class="equation-single_symbol">=</span> [intraocular specific IgG/intraocular total IgG] / <br />[serum specific IgG/serum total IgG]</p>
			<p class="body-text">The GW coefficient is used clinically in Eu&#173;rope, where an index of more than 3 indicates intraocular infection by the specific pathogen against which the antibody was produced. The GW coefficient was used to demonstrate that aqueous from eyes with Fuchs uveitis syndrome (FUS) had markedly elevated intraocular IgG titers to rubella virus compared with levels found in controls. The average GW coefficient was 20.6&#160;in FUS &#173;patients, compared with less than 1.4&#160;in controls.</p>

The histologic pattern often demonstrates lymphocytic infiltration, plasma cell infiltration, and granulomatous features. This mechanism may contribute to the pathophysiology of certain chronic autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, which feature formation of pathogenic antibodies.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Lymphocyte-&#173;Mediated Effector Responses</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Delayed hypersensitivity T lymphocytes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Delayed hypersensitivity (previously termed <span class="italic">Coombs and Gell type IV</span>) represents the prototypical adaptive immune mechanism for lymphocyte-&#173;triggered inflammation. It is especially power&#173;ful in secondary immune responses. Previously primed DH CD4<span class="body-text--no-indent-_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> T lymphocytes leave the lymph node, home into local tissues where antigen persists, and become activated by restimulation with the specific priming antigen and MHC class II–&#173;expressing APCs. Fully activated DH T lymphocytes secrete mediators and cytokines, leading to the recruitment and activation of macrophages and/or other nonspecific leukocytes (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure">Fig 2–7</span>). The term <span class="italic">delayed</span> for this type of hypersensitivity refers to the fact that the reaction becomes maximal 12–48 hours &#173;after antigen exposure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Analy&#173;sis of experimental animal models and the histologic changes of &#173;human inflammation suggest that dif&#173;fer&#173;ent subtypes of DH might exist. One of the most impor&#173;tant determinants of the pattern of DH reaction is the subtype of DH CD4<span class="body-text_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> effector T cells that mediate the reaction. Just as helper T lymphocytes can be differentiated into 3 groups—&#173;Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets—&#173;according to the spectrum of cytokines secreted, DH T lymphocytes can also be grouped by the same criteria. Experimentally, the Th1 subset of cytokines, especially IFN-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">γ</span> (also known as <span class="italic">macrophage-&#173;activating &#173;factor</span>) and TNF-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">β</span>, activates macrophages to secrete inflammatory mediators and kill pathogens, thus amplifying inflammation. Th1-&#173;mediated DH mechanisms, therefore, are thought to produce the following effects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">the classic DH reaction (eg, the purified protein derivative [PPD] skin reaction)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">immunity to intracellular infections (eg, to mycobacteria or <span class="bullet-list-mid_italic">Pneumocystis</span> organisms)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">immunity to fungi</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">most forms of severe T-&#173;lymphocyte–&#173;mediated autoimmune diseases</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">chronic transplant rejection</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;2–3</span> summarizes ocular inflammatory diseases thought to require a major contribution of Th1 DH effector mechanisms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Th2 subset of DH cells secretes IL-4, IL-5, and other cytokines. IL-4 can induce B lymphocytes to synthesize IgE, and IL-5 can recruit and activate eosinophils within a site. IL-4 can also induce macrophage granulomas in response to parasite-&#173;derived antigens. Thus, Th2-&#173;mediated DH mechanisms are thought to play a major role in the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">response to parasite infections</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">late-&#173;phase responses of allergic reactions</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">asthma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">atopic dermatitis or other manifestations of atopic diseases</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The per&#173;sis&#173;tence of certain infectious agents, especially bacteria within intracellular compartments of APCs and certain extracellular parasites, can cause destructive induration with granuloma formation and &#173;giant cells, termed the <span class="italic">granulomatous</span> form of DH. However, immune complex deposition and innate immune mechanisms in response to heavy metal or foreign-&#173;body reactions can also cause granulomatous inflammation, in which the inflammatory cascade (resulting in DH) is triggered in the absence of specific T lymphocytes. Unfortunately, for most clinical entities in which T-&#173;lymphocyte responses are suspected, especially autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, the precise immunologic mechanisms remain highly speculative. See <span class="body-text_xref-sidebar">Clinical Example 2–3</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Th17 cells have also been implicated in DH responses. Depending on the local microenvironment, Th cells can also change lineage-&#173;specific functions. For example, Th17 cells can gain the ability to secrete Th1 cytokines. They can also switch to a Treg phenotype. This immune plasticity is valuable to homeostasis, minimizing tissue damage associated with DH responses, while maintaining effective microbial clearance.</p>
			<p class="h3">Cytotoxic lymphocytes</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Cytotoxic T lymphocytes</span> Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are a subset of antigen-&#173;specific T lymphocytes, usually bearing the CD8 marker, that are especially good at killing tumor cells and virus-&#173;infected cells. The CTLs can also mediate graft rejection and some types of autoimmunity. In most cases, the ideal antigen for CTLs is an intracellular protein that occurs naturally or is produced &#173;because of viral infection. The CTLs appear to require help from CD4<span class="h4-text_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> helper T-&#173;lymphocyte signals to fully differentiate. Primed <span class="h4-text_italic">precursor</span> CTLs leave the lymph node and migrate to the target tissue, where they are restimulated by the interaction of the CTL antigen receptor and foreign antigens within the antigen pocket of MHC class I molecules (HLA-&#173;A, -&#173;B, or -&#173;C) on the target cell. Additional CD4<span class="h4-text_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> T lymphocytes help at the site, and expression of other accessory costimulatory molecules on the target is often required to obtain maximal killing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cytotoxic T lymphocytes kill cells in 1 of 2 ways: “assassination” or “suicide” induction (<span class="body-text_xref-figure">Fig 2–8</span>). <span class="italic">Assassination</span> refers to CTL-&#173;mediated lysis of targets. A specialized pore-&#173;forming protein called <span class="italic">perforin</span> is released that inserts into cell membranes and &#173;causes osmotic lysis of the cell. <span class="italic">Suicide induction</span> refers to the capability of CTLs to stimulate programmed cell death of target cells, called <span class="italic">apoptosis,</span> using the CD95 ligand (FasL) to activate the CD95 receptor (Fas) on target cells. Alternatively, CTLs can release cytokines such as TNF to induce apoptosis. The CTLs produce low-&#173;grade lymphocytic infiltrate within tumors or infected tissues and usually kill without causing significant inflammation.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Natu&#173;ral killer cells</span> Natu&#173;ral killer (NK) cells are a subset of non-&#173;T, non-&#173;B lymphocytes. They kill tumor cells and virus-&#173;infected cells using the same molecular mechanisms as CTLs. Unlike CTLs, NK cells do not have a specific antigen receptor. Instead, they are triggered by receptors that may be activating or inhibitory. Activating receptors trigger the NK cell to kill target cells that display molecules that should not be pres&#173;ent or cells that are missing MHC Class I molecules. Inhibitory NK receptors prevent NK cells from indiscriminately attacking healthy host tissue by recognizing ligands that &#173;ought to be pres&#173;ent. &#173;There are several families of NK receptors, including C-&#173;type lectin receptors (CTLRs) and killer immunoglobulin-&#173;like receptors (KIRs). &#173;Because NK cells are not antigen specific, theoretically the response does not have the time delay associated with induction of the adaptive, antigen-&#173;specific CTL immune response. However, NK cells do require some of the same effector activation signals at the tissue site, especially cytokine stimulation. Thus, NK cells are prob&#173;ably most effective in combination with adaptive effector responses.</p>
			<p class="h2">Combined Antibody and Cellular Effector Mechanisms</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Antibody-&#173;dependent cellular cytotoxicity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An antibody can combine with a cell-&#173;associated antigen such as a tumor or viral antigen, but if the antibody is not a subclass that activates complement, it may not induce cytotoxicity. However, &#173;because the Fc tail of the antibody is exposed, vari&#173;ous leukocytes recognize the Fc domain and are directed to the cell through the antibody. Binding to the antibody then activates vari&#173;ous leukocyte cytotoxic mechanisms, including degranulation and cytokine production.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because &#173;human leukocytes express vari&#173;ous types of Fc receptors—&#173;IgG subclasses have 3 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent Fcg receptors, IgE has 2 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent Fce receptors, and so on—&#173;leukocyte subsets differ in their capacity to recognize and bind dif&#173;fer&#173;ent antibody isotypes. Classically, <span class="italic">antibody-&#173;dependent cellular cytotoxicity</span> (ADCC) was observed to be mediated by a subset of large granular (non-&#173;T, non-&#173;B) lymphocytes, called <span class="italic">killer cells,</span> that induce cell death in a manner similar to CTLs. The killer cell itself is nonspecific but gains antigen specificity through interaction with specific antibody. Macrophages, NK cells, certain T lymphocytes, and neutrophils can also participate in ADCC using other Fc receptor types. An IgE-&#173;dependent form of ADCC may also exist for eosinophils.</p>
			<p class="body-text">ADCC is presumed to be impor&#173;tant in tumor surveillance, antimicrobial host protection, graft rejection, and certain autoimmune diseases, such as cutaneous systemic lupus erythematosus. However, this effector mechanism prob&#173;ably does not play an impor&#173;tant role in uveitis, although it might contribute to antiparasitic immunity.</p>
			<p class="h3">Acute IgE-&#173;mediated mast-&#173;cell degranulation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mast cells bind IgE antibodies to their surface through a high-&#173;affinity Fc receptor specific for IgE molecules, positioning the antigen-&#173;recognition site of the bound IgE externally (<span class="body-text--no-indent-_xref-figure">Fig 2–9</span>). Combining 2 adjacent IgE antibody molecules with a specific allergen &#173;causes degranulation of the mast cell and release of preformed and de novo synthesized mediators within minutes. This acute inflammatory reaction is called <span class="italic">immediate hypersensitivity</span> (previously termed <span class="italic">Coombs and Gell type I</span>, or <span class="italic">anaphylaxis</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Preformed mediators include histamine, serotonin, proteoglycans (heparin), neutral proteases (ie, tryptase, chymase), chemotactic factors (eosinophil, neutrophil, or monocyte), and possibly basic fibroblast growth &#173;factor. Among the newly generated mediators are the arachidonic acid metabolites prostaglandin D<span class="body-text_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>, leukotrienes, and thromboxane as well as Th2-&#173;type cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13), TNF-&#173;<span class="body-text_greek">α</span>, IL-1, and CCL2.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The resulting effects include vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, contraction of bronchial and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, and increased mucous secretion in mucosal sites. Mast cell-&#173;derived cytokines play a role in the late phase of allergic response by activating endothelial cells to recruit eosinophils and other inflammatory cells at the site of hypersensitivity reactions, thus sustaining inflammation. When severe, the immediate hypersensitivity response can produce a systemic reaction, with manifestations ranging from generalized skin lesions, such as erythema, urticaria, or angioedema, to severely altered vascular permeability with plasma leakage into tissues and airway obstruction or hypotensive shock.</p>

					<p class="sidebar-h2 ParaOverride-1"><span class="sidebar-h2">Primary and secondary response to tuberculosis</span> The afferent phase of the primary response begins &#173;after the inhalation of live organisms, which proliferate slowly within the lung. Alveolar macrophages ingest the bacteria and transport the organisms to the hilar lymph nodes, where the pro&#173;cessing phase begins. Over the next few days, as T and B lymphocytes are primed, the hilar nodes become enlarged &#173;because of the increased number of dividing T and B lymphocytes as well as the generalized increased trafficking of other lymphocytes through the nodes. The effector phase begins when the primed T lymphocytes recirculate and enter the infected lung. The T lymphocytes interact with the macrophage-&#173;ingested bacteria, and cytokines are released that activate neighboring macrophages to differentiate into epithelioid cells and to fuse into &#173;giant cells, eventually forming caseating granulomas. Meanwhile, some of the effector T lymphocytes home to other lymph nodes throughout the body, where they become inactive memory T lymphocytes, trafficking and recirculating throughout the secondary lymphoid tissue.</p>
					<p class="sidebar-text">A secondary response in the skin is the basis of the tuberculin skin test used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB). The afferent phase of the secondary response begins when a purified protein derivative (PPD) reagent (antigens purified from nontuberculous mycobacteria) is injected into the dermis. &#173;These antigens are taken up by dermal macrophages. </p>
					<p class="sidebar-text">The secondary pro&#173;cessing phase begins when &#173;these PPD-&#173;stimulated macrophages migrate into the draining lymph node, where they encounter memory T lymphocytes from the previous lung infection. This leads to reactivation of memory T lymphocytes. </p>
					<p class="sidebar-text">The secondary effector phase commences when the reactivated memory T lymphocytes recirculate and home back into the dermis, where they encounter additional antigen and macrophages at the injection site, causing the T lymphocytes to become fully activated and release cytokines. Within 24–72 hours, the cytokines induce infiltration of additional lymphocytes and monocytes as well as fibrin clotting. This pro&#173;cess produces the typical indurated dermal lesion of the TB skin test, called the <span class="sidebar-text_italic">tuberculin form</span> of delayed hypersensitivity (DH). Some individuals, however, are not able to mount a robust DH immune response, explaining the situation of a negative PPD result in the face of active infection (anergy). </p>
					<p class="sidebar-text">A disadvantage of skin testing is the need to examine the injection site 48–72 hours &#173;later. The&#160;interferon-&#173;gamma release assays (IGRAs) eliminate this disadvantage. In this testing method, peripheral blood is collected and exposed to &#173;specific <span class="sidebar-text_italic">M tuberculosis</span> antigens. If a patient has been exposed to TB, circulating T lymphocytes that are TB antigen specific should be pres&#173;ent. When exposed to TB antigen, the T cells release interferon gamma (IFN-&#173;<span class="sidebar-text_greek">γ</span>), which can be mea&#173;sured &#173;either as the concentration of IFN-&#173;<span class="sidebar-text_greek">γ</span> or as the number of cells releasing IFN-&#173;<span class="sidebar-text_greek">γ</span>.</p>

					<p class="sidebar-h2 ParaOverride-1"><span class="sidebar-h2">The role of Th17 cells in birdshot chorioretinopathy</span>  Birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR) is a severe, progressive, posterior uveitis. It is typically characterized by multiple distinctive choroidal lesions in the fundus (not always apparent in the initial phase of the disease), vitritis, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis leading to diffuse capillary leakage and macular/optic disc edema. Uncontrolled BSCR usually leads to extensive ret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy with visual field loss, floaters, glare, and blurred vision. Significant electroretinographic abnormalities are clinically manifested by poor vision in dim lighting, and loss of color and contrast sensitivity. While the link between HLA-&#173;A29 and BSCR is well known, the precise pathogenesis of the disease is still unclear. Histopathologic evidence has demonstrated that BSCR choroidal and vitreal infiltrates are predominantly composed of T cells. Studies of cytokine levels suggest that Th17 cells may play an impor&#173;tant role in BSCR. The cytokines IL-1<span class="sidebar-h2_greek">β</span>, IL-6, and TGF-&#173;<span class="sidebar-h2_greek">β</span>, which contribute to the differentiation of Th17 cells, have been found to be elevated in ocular fluids and serum of BSCR patients. Elevation of IL-17, the hallmark cytokine of Th17, has also been mea&#173;sured in serum from BSCR patients. Elevations of &#173;these cytokines have been demonstrated in other types of noninfectious ocular inflammatory disorders, including idiopathic uveitis, Beh<span class="sidebar-h2_accent">ç</span>et disease, and even scleritis. Knowledge of the role of Th17&#160;in some types of uveitis may guide treatment with commercially available biologic agents that target Th17 cell activity directly or indirectly. Studies of the efficacy of such agents including secukinumab (anti-&#173;IL-17), ustekinumab (anti-&#173;IL-12 and 23), and tocilizumab (anti-&#173;IL-6) as treatment for uveitis are ongoing.</p>

			<p class="sidebar-h2 ParaOverride-1"><span class="sidebar-h2">Toxocara granuloma (Th2 DH)</span> <span class="sidebar-h2_italic">Toxocara canis</span> is a nematode parasite that infects up to 2% of all &#173;children worldwide. It can occasionally produce inflammatory vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal manifestations. Although the ocular immunology of this disorder is not clearly delineated, animal models and a study of the immunopathogenesis of &#173;human nematode infections at other sites suggest the following scenario. The primary immune response begins in the gut &#173;after ingestion of &#173;viable eggs, which mature into larvae within the intestine. The primary pro&#173;cessing phase produces a strong Th2 response, leading to a primary effector response that includes production of IgM, IgG, and IgE antibodies, as well as Th2-&#173;mediated DH T lymphocytes. Accidental avoidance of immune effector mechanisms may result in hematogenous dissemination of a few larvae to the choroid or ret&#173;ina, followed by invasion into the ret&#173;ina and/or vitreous. &#173;There, a Th2-&#173;mediated T-&#173;lymphocyte effector response recognizes larva antigens and releases Th2-&#173;derived cytokines to induce eosinophil and macrophage infiltration, causing the characteristic eosinophilic granuloma seen in the eye. In addition, antilarval B lymphocytes can infiltrate the eye and are induced to secrete vari&#173;ous immunoglobulins, especially IgE. Fi&#173;nally, eosinophils, in part by attachment through Fc receptors, can recognize IgE or IgG bound to parasites and release cytotoxic granules containing the antiparasitic cationic protein directly near the larvae, using a mechanism similar to antibody-&#173;dependent cellular cytotoxicity.</p>

			<p class="sidebar-h2"><span class="sidebar-h2">Sympathetic ophthalmia (Th1 DH)</span> Sympathetic ophthalmia is a bilateral panuveitis that follows penetrating trauma to an eye. This disorder represents one of the few &#173;human diseases in which autoimmunity can be directly linked to an initiating event. In most cases, penetrating injury activates the afferent phase. It is unclear &#173;whether the injury &#173;causes a de novo primary immunization to self-&#173;antigens—&#173;perhaps &#173;because of externalization of sequestered uveal antigens through the wound and exposure to the afferent immune response arc of the conjunctiva or extraocular sites—or if the injury instead somehow changes the immunologic microenvironment of the ret&#173;ina, ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE), and uvea so that a secondary afferent response is initiated that serves to alter preexisting tolerance to ret&#173;i&#173;nal and uveal self-&#173;antigens.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text">The inflammatory effector response is generally thought to be dominated by a Th1-&#173;mediated DH mechanism generated in response to uveal or ret&#173;i&#173;nal antigens. CD4<span class="sidebar-text_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>  T lymphocytes predominate early in the disease course, although CD8<span class="sidebar-text_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>  T lymphocytes can be numerous in chronic cases. Activated macrophages are also numerous in granulomas, and Th1 cytokines have been identified in the vitreous or produced by T lymphocytes recovered from the eyes of affected patients. Although the target antigen for sympathetic ophthalmia is unknown, cutaneous immunization in experimental animals with certain ret&#173;i&#173;nal antigens (arrestin, rhodopsin, interphotoreceptor retinoid-&#173;binding protein), RPE-&#173;associated antigens, and melanocyte-&#173;associated tyrosinase can induce autoimmune uveitis with physiology or features suggestive of sympathetic ophthalmia. Th1-&#173;mediated DH is thought to mediate many forms of ocular inflammation. &#173;Table&#160;2–3 lists other examples.</p>
