				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Anterior uveitis constitutes the majority of all uveitis cases and is often treated with topical corticosteroids.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The first episode of mild, nongranulomatous, unilateral anterior uveitis may not require further systemic workup.</li>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anterior uveitis is the most common form of uveitis, accounting for more than 90% of cases in a community-&#173;based practice. Incidence in the United States varies by age, from approximately 7 cases per 100,000 person-&#173;years in persons aged 14&#160;years and younger up to approximately 220 per 100,000 persons aged 65&#160;years and older.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because uveitis may occur secondary to inflammation of the cornea and/or sclera, it is impor&#173;tant for the physician to evaluate &#173;these structures carefully to rule out primary keratitis or scleritis. Inflammation of the sclera and the cornea is covered in depth in BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea;</span> see also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7.</span></p>

			<p class="h2">Acute Nongranulomatous Anterior Uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The classic pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of acute anterior uveitis is the sudden onset of pain, redness, and photophobia that can be associated with decreased vision. Fine keratic precipitates (KPs) dust the corneal endothelium in most cases. Active disease is characterized by anterior chamber cells and variable flare. Severe cases may show a protein coagulum in the aqueous or, less commonly, a hypopyon (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-1</span>). Occasionally, a fibrin net forms across the pupillary margin (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-2</span>), potentially producing a seclusion membrane and iris bomb<span class="accent">é</span>. Iris vessels may be dilated, and, on rare occasions, a spontaneous hyphema occurs. Cells may also be pres&#173;ent in the anterior vitreous. Fundus lesions are not characteristic, although uveitic macular edema and disc edema may be noted. Occasionally, intraocular pressure (IOP) may be elevated &#173;because of trabeculitis, blockage of the trabecular meshwork by debris and cells, or pupillary block.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The inflammation usually lasts several days to weeks, up to 3 months. Two patterns may occur. In the first type, the attack is acute and unilateral, with a history of episodes alternating between the 2 eyes; this pattern is typical for HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;associated anterior uveitis. &#173;Either eye may be affected, but recurrence is rarely bilateral. The second pattern is acute and bilateral.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment to eliminate inflammation, prevent cicatrization, and minimize damage to the uveal structures. Topical corticosteroids are the first line of treatment, and administration &#173;every 1–2 hours is often needed. If necessary, periocular or oral corticosteroids may be used for severe episodes. Initial attacks may require all 3 routes of administration, particularly in severe cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular morbidity can be reduced by timely diagnosis, aggressive initial therapy, and patient adherence. In cases with a recurrent course, maintenance therapy with low-&#173;dose topical corticosteroids may be needed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corticosteroid-&#173;sparing drugs, such as antimetabolites, and &#173;others may be needed for long-&#173;term therapy in chronic or frequently recurrent anterior uveitis. Tumor necrosis &#173;factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy has been effective in recalcitrant anterior uveitis, particularly in HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;positive patients. Cycloplegic agents can relieve pain and can break and prevent formation of synechiae. They can be given topically or with conjunctival cotton pledgets soaked in tropicamide, cyclopentolate, or phenylephrine hydrochloride (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">HLA-&#173;B27 is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen pres&#173;ent in approximately 8% of the general population in the United States. Approximately 40%–50% of patients with acute anterior uveitis are HLA-B27 positive. Thus, although patients with recurrent anterior nongranulomatous uveitis should be tested for HLA-&#173;B27, the presence of HLA-B27 alone does not provide an absolute diagnosis. Further, the precise trigger for acute anterior uveitis in HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;positive persons remains unclear.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several autoimmune diseases known collectively as the <span class="italic">seronegative spondyloarthropathies</span> are strongly associated with both acute anterior uveitis and HLA-&#173;B27. Patients with &#173;these diseases, by definition, do not test positive for rheumatoid &#173;factor. The seronegative spondyloarthropathies include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">ankylosing spondylitis (AS)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">reactive arthritis syndrome</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">inflammatory bowel disease</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">psoriatic arthritis</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">These entities are sometimes clinically indistinguishable, and all may be associated with spondylitis and sacroiliitis. &#173;Women are more likely than men to experience aty&#173;pi&#173;cal spondy&#173;loarthropathies.</p>

			<p class="h3">HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;related diseases</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Ankylosing spondylitis</span> AS ranges in severity from asymptomatic to crippling. Symptoms of this disorder include lower back pain and morning stiffness. Up to 90% of patients with AS test positive for HLA-&#173;B27, although most HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;positive individuals do not develop the disease. The chance that an HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;positive patient &#173;will develop spondyloarthritis or eye disease is 1&#160;in 4. &#173;Family members may also have AS or anterior uveitis. Often, persons with anterior uveitis lack symptoms of back disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist may be the first physician to suspect AS in an individual patient. Symptoms or &#173;family history of back prob&#173;lems together with HLA-B27 positivity suggest the diagnosis. Sacro&#173;iliac imaging studies should be obtained when indicated by a suggestive history of morning lower back stiffness that improves with exertion. Patients should be informed of the risk of deformity and referred to a rheumatologist. Pulmonary apical fibrosis and cardiovascular disease (aortic valvular insufficiency) may also develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of systemic treatment for AS. Sulfasalazine may be used in patients whose joint disease is not controlled with NSAIDs, and it may reduce the frequency of uveitis recurrences. However, TNF inhibitors are gaining &#173;favor for second-&#173;line treatment in recalcitrant cases given their rapid therapeutic effect and overall efficacy. Ophthalmologists should also recognize that early diagnosis is impor&#173;tant &#173;because nonpharmacologic interventions such as exercise, physical therapy, and smoking cessation may help slow disease progression.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Reactive arthritis syndrome</span> Reactive arthritis syndrome, formerly known as <span class="h4-text_italic">Reiter syndrome,</span> consists of the classic diagnostic triad of nonspecific urethritis, polyarthritis, and conjunctival inflammation, often accompanied by nongranulomatous anterior uveitis. The HLA-B27 marker is found in approximately 50%–75% of patients. The condition constitutes less than 2% of all spondyloarthropathies and occurs most frequently in young adult men, although 10% of patients are female.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Episodes of diarrhea or dysentery without urethritis can trigger reactive arthritis syndrome. <span class="italic">Ureaplasma urealyticum</span> as well as <span class="italic">Chlamydia, Shigella, Salmonella,</span> and <span class="italic">Yersinia</span> species have all been implicated as triggering infections, although pathogens cannot be isolated from affected joints. Arthritis begins within 30 days of infection in 80% of patients. The knees, ankles, feet, and wrists are affected asymmetrically and in an oligoarticular (4 or fewer joints) distribution. Sacroiliitis is pres&#173;ent in as many as 70% of patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to the classic triad, 2 other conditions are considered major diagnostic criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-7"><span class="bullet-list_italic">keratoderma blennorrhagicum:</span> a scaly, erythematous, irritating disorder of the palms and &#173;soles of the feet (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-4</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-8"><span class="bullet-list_italic">circinate balanitis:</span> a per&#173;sis&#173;tent, scaly, erythematous, circumferential rash of the distal penis</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Extraarticular findings such as nail bed pitting, oral ulcers, conjunctivitis, uveitis, and constitutional symptoms help establish a diagnosis of reactive arthritis syndrome. Most cases resolve &#173;after a short episode. Occasionally, the disease becomes chronic. Eye involvement occurs in approximately 20%. Conjunctivitis is the most common eye finding associated with this disease, and it is usually mucopurulent and papillary. Punctate and subepithelial keratitis may also occur, occasionally leaving permanent corneal scars. Acute nongranulomatous anterior uveitis occurs in up to 10% of patients and may become bilateral and chronic.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Inflammatory bowel disease</span> Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease (granulomatous ileocolitis) are both associated with acute anterior uveitis. Up to 12% of patients with ulcerative colitis and 2.4% of patients with Crohn disease develop acute anterior uveitis. Occasionally, bowel disease is asymptomatic and follows the onset of uveitis. Twenty &#173;percent of patients with inflammatory bowel disease have sacroiliitis; of &#173;these, 60% are HLA-B27 positive. Patients with both acute anterior uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are more likely to be HLA-B27 positive and have sacroiliitis. Patients with IBD may also develop sclerouveitis, but &#173;these individuals are more commonly HLA-B27 negative, have symptoms resembling rheumatoid arthritis, and usually do not develop sacroiliitis. HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;negative IBD patients may also be more likely to develop intermediate uveitis.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Psoriatic arthritis</span> The diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis is made according to findings of typical cutaneous changes (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-5</span>), terminal phalangeal joint inflammation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-6</span>), and ungual involvement. Twenty &#173;percent of patients may have sacroiliitis, and IBD occurs more frequently than would be expected by chance. Up to 25% of patients develop anterior uveitis, which tends to be insidious and bilateral; it is also more likely to be chronic than is the uveitis associated with other spondyloarthropathies. Risk is particularly high in psoriatic spondylitis patients. Uveitis may be more severe in HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;positive patients. Treatment consists of cycloplegic and mydriatic agents and corticosteroids, which are usually given topically. In severe cases, periocular or systemic corticosteroids may be required, and chronic cases may need immunomodulatory therapy (IMT).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anterior uveitis in patients with psoriasis without arthritis has distinct clinical features. The mean age of onset is older than in idiopathic or HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;associated uveitis and may be bilateral and of longer duration. Posterior segment involvement can be pres&#173;ent.</p>

			<p class="h3">Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome occurs predominantly in adolescent girls and &#173;women up to their early 30s; the mean age of onset is 21&#160;years. Uveitis is typically a bilateral, nongranulomatous, anterior uveitis. Ocular symptoms and findings are more severe in patients with recurrent disease, with development of fibrin, posterior synechiae, larger KPs, and, rarely, hypopyon. Posterior segment involvement is rare but may include vitritis, multifocal chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular leakage as well as optic nerve and macular edema (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-7</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients may pres&#173;ent with ophthalmic findings before systemic symptoms and tubulointerstitial nephritis develop. More commonly, however, patients pres&#173;ent with systemic symptoms before the development of uveitis. The following criteria are required for a clinical diagnosis of TINU syndrome:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">abnormal serum creatinine level or decreased creatinine clearance</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">abnormal urinalysis findings, with increased <span class="bullet-list_greek">β</span>2-microglobulin level, proteinuria, presence of eosinophils, pyuria or hematuria, urinary white cell casts, and normoglycemic glycosuria</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">associated systemic illness, consisting of fever, weight loss, anorexia, fatigue, arthralgias, and myalgias; &#173;there may also be abnormal liver function, eosinophilia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The etiology remains unclear. Seroreactivity against ret&#173;i&#173;nal and renal antigens has been demonstrated. The syndrome has been reported to be strongly associated with HLA-&#173;DRB1<span class="CharOverride-1">*</span>0102. The predominance of activated CD4<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">+</span> (helper) T lymphocytes in the kidney interstitium suggests a role for cellular immunity. Renal biopsies have shown severe interstitial fibrosis. TINU syndrome is very responsive to treatment with high-&#173;dose oral corticosteroids. Some patients with a prolonged course may require IMT.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Glaucomatocyclitic crisis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Glaucomatocyclitic crisis, also known as <span class="italic">Posner-&#173;Schlossman syndrome (PSS),</span> usually manifests as a recurrent unilateral, mild, acute nongranulomatous anterior uveitis. Symptoms are vague: discomfort, blurred vision, and halos. Signs include markedly elevated IOP, corneal edema, KPs, low-&#173;grade cell and flare, and a slightly dilated pupil. Episodes last from several hours to several days, and recurrences are common over many years. Historically treatment has been topical corticosteroids and antiglaucoma medi&#173;cations, including, if necessary, systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Recent studies suggest cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a pos&#173;si&#173;ble cause of PSS, with distinct genotypes of CMV being associated with PSS and anterior uveitis as opposed to retinitis. Corneal endo&#173;theliitis, linear KPs, and male preponderance are more common among CMV-associated PSS. An anterior chamber tap can be done to confirm the diagnosis of CMV by polymerase chain reaction testing. &#173;There may be a pos&#173;si&#173;ble role for antiviral therapy in such cases.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Lens-&#173;associated uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An immune reaction to lens material may result in ocular inflammatory disease. This reaction may follow disruption of the lens capsule (traumatic or surgical), termed <span class="italic">phaco</span><span class="italic">antigenic uveitis,</span> or leakage of lens protein through the intact lens capsule in mature or hypermature cataracts, termed <span class="italic">phacolytic uveitis</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 8-8, 8-9</span>). The exact mechanism of lens-&#173;induced uveitis, although unknown, is thought to represent an immune reaction to&#160;lens proteins. Experimental animal studies suggest that altered tolerance to lens protein leads to the inflammation, which usually has an abrupt onset but occasionally occurs insidiously. Patients previously sensitized to lens protein (eg, &#173;after cataract &#173;extraction in the fellow eye) can experience inflammation within 24 hours &#173;after capsular rupture.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Phacoantigenic uveitis</span> Phacoantigenic uveitis was previously termed <span class="h4-text_italic">phacoanaphylactic </span><span class="h4-text_italic">uveitis.</span> This nomenclature is incorrect &#173;because anaphylaxis involves immunoglobulin E (IgE), mast cells, and basophils, none of which are pres&#173;ent in the more appropriately termed phacoantigenic uveitis. Clinically, patients exhibit an anterior uveitis that may be granulomatous or nongranulomatous. Small or large KPs are usually pres&#173;ent. Anterior chamber reaction varies from mild (eg, postoperative inflammation involving a small amount of retained cortex) to severe (eg, traumatic lens capsule disruption); hypopyon may be pres&#173;ent. Posterior synechiae are common, and IOP is often elevated. Inflammation in the anterior vitreous cavity is common, but fundus lesions do not occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, a zonal granulomatous inflammation is centered at the site of lens injury. Neutrophils are pres&#173;ent around the lens material with surrounding lymphocytes, plasma cells, epithelioid cells, and occasional &#173;giant cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment consists of topical and, in severe cases, systemic corticosteroids, as well as cycloplegic and mydriatic agents. Surgical removal of all lens material is usually curative. When small amounts of lens material remain, corticosteroid therapy alone may be sufficient to allow resorption of the inciting material. It is impor&#173;tant to differentiate some of &#173;these entities from postoperative endophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Phacolytic uveitis</span> Phacolytic uveitis (or <span class="h4-text_italic">phacolytic glaucoma,</span> as it is frequently referred to) involves an acute increase in IOP caused by clogging of the trabecular meshwork by macro&#173;phages engorged with lens proteins leaking through the intact capsule of a hypermature cataract. The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of elevated IOP, refractile bodies in the aqueous (representing lipid-&#173;laden macrophages), and a lack of KPs and synechiae. Therapy includes pressure reduction, often through use of osmotic agents and topical medi&#173;cations, followed quickly by cataract extraction. An aqueous tap may reveal swollen macrophages.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infectious endophthalmitis must be included in the differential diagnosis of postoperative inflammation and hypopyon. Infection with low-&#173;virulence organisms such as <span class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes</span> and <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> as well as fungal species can cause delayed or late-&#173;onset endophthalmitis &#173;after cataract surgery. Infectious endophthalmitis is discussed in more detail in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Postoperative inflammation: intraocular lens–&#173;associated uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intraocular lens (IOL)–&#173;associated uveitis ranges from mild inflammation to the uveitis-&#173;glaucoma-&#173;hyphema (UGH) syndrome. Surgical manipulation results in breakdown of the blood–&#173;aqueous barrier, leading to vulnerability in the early postoperative period. IOL implantation can activate complement cascades and promote neutrophil chemotaxis. This leads to cellular deposits on the IOL, synechiae formation, capsular opacification, and anterior capsule phimosis. Retained lens material from extracapsular cataract extraction can exacerbate the usual transient postoperative inflammation. Rarely, iris chafing caused by the edges or loops of IOLs on &#173;either the anterior or the posterior surface of the iris can result in mechanical irritation and inflammation. The motion of an iris-&#173;supported IOL or anterior chamber IOL (ACIOL) can cause intermittent corneal touch and lead to corneal endothelial damage or decompensation, low-&#173;grade anterior uveitis, peripheral anterior synechiae, recalcitrant glaucoma, and macular edema (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 8-10</span>, <span class="xref-figure">8-11</span>). &#173;These lenses should be removed and exchanged when penetrating keratoplasty is performed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Irritation of the iris root by an intraocular implant can cause UGH syndrome. Flexible ACIOLs are less likely than older rigid ACIOLs to cause UGH syndrome. &#173;Because ACIOL use is rare, UGH syndrome is encountered most commonly with sulcus placement of a single-&#173;piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL (something that should never be intentionally done). The syndrome can occur even with the appropriate placement of a 3-&#173;piece IOL in the sulcus. Ultrasound biomicroscopy or anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be helpful in evaluating lens position in cases of chronic pseudophakic uveitis. Many cases can be managed with topical corticosteroids only, although some may require IOL explantation or repositioning. UGH syndrome and chronic uveitis are also discussed in BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, the more biocompatible the IOL material, the less likely it is to incite an inflammatory response. Irregular or damaged IOL surfaces as well as polypropylene haptics have been associated with enhanced bacterial and leukocyte binding and should be avoided in patients with uveitis. In general, acrylic IOLs appear to have excellent biocompatibility, with low rates of cellular deposits and capsular opacification. Per&#173;sis&#173;tent postoperative anterior uveitis (postsurgical uveitis) is very rare and occur more commonly in eyes experiencing intraoperative complications. Foldable implant materials have also been found to be well tolerated in many patients with uveitis.</p>

			<p class="h3">Drug-&#173;induced uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">S</span>ome drugs are associated with the development of intraocular inflammation. &#173;These include rifabutin (an antibiotic used in the treatment of <span class="italic">Mycobacterium avium-&#173;intracellulare</span> infection), systemic fluoroquinolones (especially moxifloxacin, which may induce iris depigmentation and uveitis), bisphosphonates, sulfonamides, diethylcarbamazine (an antifilarial drug), and oral contraceptives. Paradoxically, certain TNF inhibitors (eg, etanercept, adalim&#173;umab) have also been associated with new-&#173;onset uveitis, psoriasis-&#173;like rash (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-12</span>), and a systemic sarcoid-&#173;like syndrome. Vaccines such as BCG vaccine and influenza vaccines, as well as the purified protein derivative used in the tuberculin skin test, have also been implicated in the development of uveitis. Intravesical BCG vaccine (sometimes used in the treatment of bladder cancer) can result in uveitis that may be immune-&#173;mediated or infectious. More recently, a spectrum of intraocular inflammation—&#173;ranging from mild anterior uveitis to ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, choroiditis, and Vogt-&#173;Koyanagi-&#173;Harada (VKH) syndrome–&#173;like panuveitis—has been associated with cancer immunotherapy, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitors (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-13</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Numerous topical antiglaucoma medi&#173;cations have been associated with uveitis. &#173;These include metipranolol (a nonselective beta-&#173;blocking drug used in the treatment of glaucoma), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, prostaglandin F<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">2</span><span class="symbol_subscript CharOverride-2">α</span> analogues, and brimonidine (<span class="greek">α</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-2">2</span>-<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">&#173;</span>adrenergic agonist). While prostaglandin analogues have been suggested to induce or worsen macular edema, evidence is anecdotal, and &#173;these glaucoma drops are generally used in uveitis patients when other topicals are not sufficient to lower IOP. Drugs that are injected directly into the eye have also been associated with uveitis. &#173;These medi&#173;cations include antibiotics, urokinase (a plasminogen activator), cidofovir (a cytosine analogue effective against CMV) and vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Treatment generally involves topical corticosteroids and cycloplegic drugs, if necessary. Recalcitrant cases may require cessation or tapering of the offending medi&#173;cation.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Chronic Anterior Uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Inflammation of the anterior segment that is per&#173;sis&#173;tent and relapses less than 3 months &#173;after discontinuation of therapy is termed <span class="italic">chronic anterior uveitis;</span> it may persist for years. This type of inflammation usually starts insidiously, with variable amounts of redness, discomfort, and photophobia. Some patients have no symptoms. The disease can be unilateral or bilateral, and the amount of inflammatory activity is variable. Uveitic macular edema, cataract progression, and secondary glaucoma are common.</p>
			<p class="h3">Juvenile idiopathic arthritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; formerly referred to as <span class="italic">juvenile chronic arthritis</span> and <span class="italic">juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</span>), is the most common systemic disorder associated with anterior uveitis in the pediatric age group. It is characterized by arthritis beginning before age 16&#160;years and lasting for at least 6 weeks.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Ocular involvement</span> JIA can be classified into 5 types according to medical history and other presenting &#173;factors according to International League of Associations of Rheumatology (ILAR) guidelines:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Systemic onset (Still disease).</span> This type, usually observed in &#173;children &#173;under age 5&#160;years, accounts for approximately 10%–15% of all cases of JIA. It is characterized by fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Joint involvement may be minimal or absent initially. Ocular involvement is rare.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Polyarticular onset.</span> Patients with this type show involvement of more than 4 joints in the first 6 months of the disease; it represents 40% of JIA cases overall but only about 10% of cases of JIA-&#173;associated anterior uveitis. Patients who are positive for rheumatoid &#173;factor may not develop uveitis.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Oligoarticular onset.</span> This type, previously also known as <span class="bullet-list_italic">pauciarticular onset,</span> constitutes 40%–50% of all cases of JIA and includes 80%–90% of patients with JIA-&#173;associated uveitis. Four or fewer joints may be involved during the first 6 months of disease, and patients may have no joint symptoms. Girls &#173;under age 5&#160;years and &#173;positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA) are at increased risk of developing chronic anterior uveitis; 25%–35% of &#173;these patients &#173;will develop uveitis, most in the first 4&#160;years.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-12">Other subgroups of JIA include enthesitis-&#173;related arthritis (ERA) and psoriatic arthritis (or psoriatic JIA). ERA accounts for 10%–20% of cases of JIA. &#173;Enthesitis, axial disease, and HLA-&#173;B27 positivity are common. The uveitis in &#173;these patients is more likely to be acute and recurrent, with pain, redness, and photophobia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The average age of onset of uveitis in patients with JIA is 6&#160;years. Uveitis generally develops within 5–7&#160;years of the onset of joint disease but may occur as long as 28&#160;years &#173;after the development of arthritis. &#173;There is usually &#173;little or no correlation between severity or timing of ocular and joint inflammation. Risk &#173;factors for the development of chronic uveitis in patients with JIA include female sex, oligoarticular onset, and the presence of circulating ANA. Most patients test negative for rheumatoid &#173;factor. HLA-&#173;DRB1<span class="CharOverride-1">*</span>11 and <span class="CharOverride-1">*</span>13 may be associated with increased risk of uveitis among JIA patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The eye is frequently white. Symptoms may include mild to moderate pain, photophobia, and blurring, although some patients are asymptomatic. Often, the eye disease is found incidentally during a routine screening or physical examination. The signs of inflammation include fine KPs, band keratopathy, flare and cells, posterior synechiae, and cataract (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-14</span>). Patients in whom JIA is suspected should undergo ANA testing and be evaluated by a pediatric rheumatologist &#173;because the joint disease may be minimal or absent at the time the uveitis is diagnosed. The differential diagnosis includes TINU, Fuchs uveitis syndrome, sarcoidosis, Blau disease, Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease, the seronegative spondyloarthropathies, herpetic uveitis, and Lyme disease.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-13"><span class="h4-head">Prognosis</span> &#173;Because of the frequently asymptomatic nature of the uveitis, profound &#173;silent ocular damage can occur, and long-&#173;term prognosis often depends on the extent of structural complications at the time of first diagnosis. Complications are frequent and often severe; they include band keratopathy, cataract, glaucoma, macular edema, chronic hypotony, and phthisis. &#173;Children with JIA, especially &#173;those who are ANA positive or have oligoarticular disease, should undergo regular slit-&#173;lamp examinations. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;8-1</span> outlines the recommended schedule for screening patients with JIA for development of uveitis, as developed by the American Acad&#173;emy of Pediatrics.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-13"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> The initial treatment for patients with JIA who have uveitis consists of topical corticosteroids. More severe cases may require use of systemic corticosteroids or IMT. The goal of treatment is to eliminate active inflammation (anterior chamber cells) and prevent new complications. Short-&#173;acting mydriatic drugs may be useful in patients with chronic flare to keep the pupil mobile and to prevent posterior synechiae formation. Use of systemic NSAIDs may permit a lower dose of corticosteroids.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because of the chronic nature of the inflammation, corticosteroid-&#173;induced complications are common. The long-&#173;term use of systemic corticosteroids in &#173;children may lead to growth retardation from premature closure of the epiphyses. Also, prolonged use of topical corticosteroids leads to cataracts and glaucoma. &#173;Because long-&#173;term use of topical corticosteroids at doses <span class="symbol">≥</span>3 times daily can increase the risk of cataract formation, systemic IMT should be considered for such cases. In addition, &#173;there is evidence that even low-&#173;grade inflammation, if pres&#173;ent for a prolonged period, can result in unacceptable ocular morbidity and loss of vision. For &#173;these reasons, many of &#173;these &#173;children are treated with methotrexate. Numerous studies have shown that this treatment regimen can effectively control the uveitis, is generally well tolerated, and can spare patients the complications of long-&#173;term corticosteroid use. In addition, several studies have demonstrated a benefit from TNF inhibitors and other biologic agents.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of cataracts in patients with JIA remains a challenge, and the use of IOLs remains controversial. &#173;Children who are left aphakic may develop amblyopia. Cataract surgery in patients with JIA-&#173;associated anterior uveitis has a high complication rate due to the difficulty in controlling the more aggressive inflammatory response pres&#173;ent in &#173;these &#173;children. Lensectomy and vitrectomy via the pars plana have been advocated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There have been reports, however, of more successful cataract surgery with IOL &#173;implants in patients with JIA. &#173;These reports highlight the importance of well-&#173;controlled uveitis through systemic IMT and the use of perioperative corticosteroids.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following considerations are useful when selecting patients with JIA for cataract &#173;surgery with IOL implants:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-14">Patients’ intraocular inflammation must be well controlled with systemic IMT for at least 3 months before surgery and must not require frequent instillation of topical corticosteroids.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Only acrylic lenses should be implanted.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Patients must be monitored frequently &#173;after cataract surgery to watch for any inflammation, and inflammation that occurs must be aggressively treated.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">IMT must be used preoperatively and postoperatively, not just perioperatively.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;Because long-&#173;term results are not available, patients must be strongly advised about the need for careful, regular, lifelong follow-up to detect late complications that may lead to loss of the eye.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-15">The ophthalmologist must have a low threshold for IOL explantation in patients who have per&#173;sis&#173;tent postoperative inflammation and recurrent cyclitic membranes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with band keratopathy should be treated (eg, using chelation with sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]) and allowed to heal well before cataract surgery is attempted. See also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span> and BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and &#173;Strabismus,</span> Chapter&#160;24.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Glaucoma should be treated with medical therapy initially, although surgical intervention is often necessary in severe cases. Standard filtering procedures are usually unsuccessful, and the use of antifibrotic drugs or aqueous drainage devices is usually required for successful control of the glaucoma.</p>

			<p class="h3">Fuchs uveitis syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fuchs uveitis syndrome (sometimes called <span class="italic">Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis</span> or <span class="italic">Fuchs hetero&#173;</span><span class="italic">chromic uveitis)</span> constitutes 2%–3% of patients referred to uveitis clinics. This condition is usually unilateral, and symptoms vary from none to mild blurring and discomfort. Signs include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">diffuse iris stromal atrophy with variable pigment epithelial layer atrophy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-15</span>)</li>

				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-17">glaucoma and cataracts, which occur frequently</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition, synechiae, chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal scars, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal periphlebitis are rare or absent and macular edema is seldom pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis is made according to the distribution of KPs, presence of heterochromia, lack of synechiae, and lack of symptoms. Heterochromia may be subtle in a brown-&#173;eyed patient, and the clinician must look carefully for signs of iris stromal atrophy. Often, the inflammation is discovered during a routine examination, such as when a unilateral cataract develops. Usually, but not invariably, a lighter-&#173;colored iris indicates the involved eye. In blue-&#173;eyed persons, however, the affected eye may become darker as the stromal atrophy progresses and the darker iris pigment epithelium shows through.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fuchs uveitis syndrome is now known to be associated with viral infections such as rubella and CMV. Association with ocular toxoplasmosis has also been reported.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients generally do well with cataract surgery, and IOLs can usually be implanted successfully. However, some patients experience substantial visual disability &#173;because of extensive vitreous opacification. Pars plana vitrectomy should be carefully considered in such instances. Glaucoma control can be difficult. Abnormal vessels bridging the &#173;angle can be seen on gonioscopy. &#173;These vessels may bleed during surgery, resulting in postoper&#173;ative hyphema.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Few cases require therapy for inflammation. The prognosis is good in most cases, even when the inflammation persists for de&#173;cades. &#173;Because topical corticosteroids can lessen the inflammation but typically do not resolve it, aggressive treatment to eradicate the cellular reaction is not indicated. Cycloplegia is seldom necessary. See BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;10</span>, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> for further discussion of Fuchs heterochromic uveitis.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-18">Intermediate Uveitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group defines <span class="italic">intermediate uveitis</span> as the subset in which the predominant site of inflammation is in the vitreous; this subset accounts for up to 15% of all cases of uveitis. Intermediate uveitis is characterized by ocular inflammation concentrated in the vitreous and the vitreous base overlying the ciliary body and peripheral retina–&#173;pars plana complex. Inflammatory cells may aggregate in the vitreous (“snowballs”), where some coalesce. In some patients, inflammatory exudative accumulation on the inferior pars plana (“snowbanking”) seems to correlate with a more severe disease pro&#173;cess. &#173;There may be associated peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal phlebitis. Anterior chamber reaction of varying severity may also occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intermediate uveitis can be associated with vari&#173;ous conditions, including sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis (MS), Lyme disease, peripheral toxocariasis, syphilis, tuberculosis, primary Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren syndrome, and infection with &#173;human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-19">Pars Planitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">pars planitis</span> refers to the subset of intermediate uveitis that is idiopathic with no associated infection or systemic disease. It is the most common form of intermediate uveitis, constituting approximately 85%–90% of cases. Previously also known as <span class="italic">chronic cyclitis</span> and <span class="italic">peripheral uveitis,</span> the condition most commonly affects persons aged 5–40&#160;years. It has a bimodal distribution, concentrating in younger (5–15&#160;years) and older (20–40&#160;years) groups. No overall sex predilection is apparent. The pathogenesis of pars planitis is not well understood.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-20">Clinical characteristics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 80% of cases of pars planitis are bilateral, which can often be asymmetric in severity. In &#173;children, the initial pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion may consist of significant anterior chamber inflammation accompanied by redness, photophobia, and discomfort. The onset in teen&#173;agers and young adults may be more insidious, with the presenting complaint generally being floaters. Ocular manifestations include anterior chamber inflammatory cells, vitreous cells, snowballs (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-17</span>), and pars plana exudates. Inferior peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal phlebitis with ret&#173;i&#173;nal venous sheathing is common. With long-&#173;standing inflammation, macular edema often develops; this condition becomes chronic and refractory in approximately 10% of patients and is the major cause of vision loss. Ischemia from ret&#173;i&#173;nal phlebitis, combined with angiogenic stimuli from intraocular inflammation, can lead to neovascularization along the inferior snowbank in up to 10% of cases. &#173;These neovascular complexes can result in vitreous hemorrhages, more common in &#173;children than adults; they also may contract, leading to peripheral tractional and rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments. In rare cases, the complexes evolve into secondary peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasoproliferative tumors—&#173;vascular masses with exudative retinopathy and minimally dilated vessels—&#173;years &#173;after the initial diagnosis. Rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments are rare but localized peripheral detachments (serous or tractional) that can occur in 4%–10% of patients with pars planitis. With chronicity, posterior synechiae and band keratopathy may also develop. Other pos&#173;si&#173;ble &#173;causes of loss of vision include cataracts, epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane, and vitreous opacification.</p>
			<p class="h3">Differential diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The differential diagnosis of intermediate uveitis includes syphilis, tuberculosis, Lyme uveitis, sarcoidosis, intermediate uveitis associated with MS, and toxocariasis. Syphilis should be checked in all uveitis patients, including those with intermediate uveitis. Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of Lyme antibody titers may be useful in regions where the disease is endemic, especially in patients with a history of tick bite or cutaneous and articular disease. Anterior and intermediate uveitis may occur in up to 20% of patients with MS. Sarcoidosis-&#173;associated uveitis pres&#173;ents as an intermediate disease in 7% of cases. A peripheral granuloma such as that seen in toxocariasis can mimic the unilateral pars plana snowbank in a child and should be ruled out. Serologic testing can be helpful in &#173;these cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vitritis without other ocular findings can be suggestive of primary central ner&#173;vous system (CNS) lymphoma. &#173;These patients are generally much older at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion than patients with pars planitis, usually in their fifth or sixth de&#173;cade of life or older.</p>
			<p class="h3">Ancillary tests and histologic findings</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diagnosis of intermediate uveitis is made according to classic clinical findings. Laboratory workup to evaluate for other &#173;causes of intermediate uveitis, including sarcoidosis, Lyme disease in high-risk cases, and syphilis, is impor&#173;tant. Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of serum &#173;angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and Lyme antibody titers, chest imaging, and syphilis testing should be considered. Fluorescein angiography (FA) may show diffuse peripheral venous leakage, disc leakage, and macular edema. Ultrasound biomicroscopy may be used in the case of a small pupil or dense cataract to demonstrate peripheral exudates or membranes over the pars plana.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologic examination of eyes with pars planitis shows vitreous condensation and cellular infiltration in the vitreous base. The inflammatory cells consist mostly of macro&#173;phages, lymphocytes, and a few plasma cells. Pars planitis is also characterized by peripheral lymphocytic cuffing of venules and a loose fibrovascular membrane over the pars plana (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-18</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Prognosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinical course of pars planitis may be divided into 3 types. Approximately 10% of cases have a self-&#173;limiting, benign course; 30% have a smoldering course with remissions and exacerbations; and 60% have a prolonged course without exacerbations. Pars planitis can remain active for many years. In some cases, the disease “burns out” &#173;after a few years. If macular edema is treated &#173;until resolution and kept from returning by adequate control of inflammation, the long-&#173;term visual prognosis can be good, with nearly 75% of patients maintaining visual acuity of 20/40 or better &#173;after 10&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="h3">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Therapy should be directed &#173;toward treating the under&#173;lying cause of the inflammation, and infectious etiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating therapy. If an under&#173;lying condition is not identified, as in pars planitis, or if therapy of an associated condition consists of nonspecific control of inflammation, as in sarcoidosis, anti-&#173;inflammatory therapy should be implemented.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corticosteroids, oral or periocular, usually constitute the first line of therapy. Periocular depot corticosteroid injections of triamcinolone or methylprednisolone may be given via the posterior sub-&#173;Tenon (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>) or orbital floor route. &#173;These can be repeated as frequently as &#173;every 3–4 weeks. In most cases, the inflammation responds and the macular edema improves; however, some cases prove recalcitrant and macular edema may recur. Patients, especially &#173;those with a history of glaucoma, must be carefully monitored for corticosteroid-&#173;induced IOP elevation. Other complications of periocular corticosteroids include aponeurotic ptosis, fat prolapse, enophthalmos, and, in rare instances, globe perforation. Cataract formation can occur with any form of corticosteroid therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intravitreal corticosteroid injections may be an alternative to periocular injections in refractory cases. &#173;These injections carry risks of sustained IOP elevation and glaucoma and very small risks of ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and endophthalmitis. Injections should be administered away from areas of snowbanking and areas with peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal pathology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other forms of local ste&#173;roid injections, such as dexamethasone intravitreal implants, can also be considered. Local treatment with corticosteroid injections is a particularly appealing approach in unilateral cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic corticosteroid therapy may also be used, especially in severe or bilateral cases. Patients may be treated with an initial dosage of 1&#160;mg/kg/day, with gradual tapering &#173;every 1–2 weeks to dosages of less than 10&#160;mg/day &#173;after 8 weeks of treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As with all autoimmune uveitis, if corticosteroid therapy fails or long-&#173;term use of high doses of corticosteroids is needed to control the inflammation, immunomodulatory treatment is indicated. Systemic immunomodulatory drugs such as antimetabolites, T-cell inhibitors, biologic agents, and alkylating drugs can be considered. Several reports from the Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Eye Diseases (SITE) cohort study indicated that cyclosporine, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil &#173;were effective in achieving sustained control of inflammation in 70%–80% of patients with intermediate uveitis. The TNF inhibitor adalimumab is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of uveitis, including intermediate uveitis. &#173;Because TNF inhibitors can exacerbate MS, it is impor&#173;tant to consider an extensive workup for MS, including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, before initiating this therapy. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span> for more detailed information on IMT in uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Alternative therapies for pars planitis include peripheral ablation of the pars plana snowbank with cryotherapy and/or indirect &#173;laser photocoagulation to the peripheral ret&#173;ina. Cryotherapy is rarely used &#173;because of concerns about further inducing inflammation. &#173;Laser photocoagulation can be used in cases of ret&#173;i&#173;nal ischemia and neovascularization to prevent vitreous hemorrhage; it does not seem to increase the risk of rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Intravitreal anti-&#173;VEGF treatment can also be used for ret&#173;i&#173;nal or choroidal neovascularization in pars planitis in other&#173;wise quiet eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pars plana vitrectomy, with or without &#173;laser photocoagulation, can also be helpful in treating complications of pars planitis or in cases recalcitrant to IMT. In such cases, a perioperative increase in systemic immunosuppression and/or corticosteroids should be considered. Pars plana vitrectomy may be necessary to treat severe vision loss caused by vitreous hemorrhage or traction, ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, or epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane. It can also be considered for cases with significant vitreous opacities despite adequate IMT. In cases involving epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane or vitreomacular traction, separation of the posterior hyaloid membrane during vitrectomy may have a beneficial effect in reducing macular edema. Potential complications include ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, endophthalmitis, and cataract formation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complications of pars planitis include cataract, glaucoma, macular edema, ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, retinoschisis, and tractional or rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Cataracts occur in up to 60% of cases. Cataract surgery with IOL implantation may be complicated by smoldering low-&#173;grade inflammation; recurring opacification of the posterior capsule despite capsulotomy; recurrent retrolental membranes; and chronic macular edema, even in cases in which &#173;there is no active cellular inflammation. Combining pars plana vitrectomy with cataract extraction and IOL implantation may reduce the risk of &#173;these complications. Glaucoma—&#173;both angle-&#173;closure and open-&#173;angle—&#173;occurs in approximately 10% of patients with pars planitis. Macular edema may occur in 50% of patients with intermediate uveitis and is a hallmark of pars planitis. Neovascularization of the ret&#173;ina, disc, and peripheral snowbank has been reported. Occasionally, vitreous hemorrhage is the presenting sign of pars planitis, especially in &#173;children; it can be treated effectively with pars plana vitrectomy. Tractional and rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments can occur in up to 10% of patients and may require scleral buckling, sometimes combined with vitrectomy. Risk &#173;factors for rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment include severe inflammation, use of cryotherapy at the time of a vitrectomy, and neovascularization of the pars plana snowbank.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-22">Multiple Sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Uveitis is 10 times more common in MS patients than in the general population. The frequency of uveitis in patients with MS is reported to be as high as 30%, and the onset of uveitis may precede the diagnosis of MS in up to 25% of patients and by 5–10&#160;years. MS usually affects white &#173;women 20–50&#160;years of age, and intermediate uveitis is the most common manifestation of MS-&#173;associated uveitis. Up to 95% of cases are bilateral. Up to 15% of patients with pars planitis may eventually develop MS. Intermediate uveitis appears to be of milder severity in MS than in idiopathic cases. Macular edema is less common. Most patients develop mild vitritis with periphlebitis. Periphlebitis in MS is not clearly related to optic neuritis, systemic exacerbations, or disease severity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The immunopathogenesis of MS is not well understood but appears to involve humoral, cellular, and immunoge&#173;ne&#173;tic components directed against myelin. HLA-&#173;DR15 appears to be associated with the combination of MS and uveitis. Immunocytologic studies have shown some cross-&#173;reactivity between myelin-&#173;associated glycoprotein and M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of MS with interferon may have a beneficial effect on intermediate uveitis and associated macular edema. More recently, daclizumab, an interleukin-2 receptor blocking antibody, was approved for the treatment of MS and may be helpful in controlling uveitis. Fingolimod therapy for MS, on the other hand, can lead to macular edema. As biologic therapies for uveitis become more common, it is particularly impor&#173;tant to consider the possibility of MS in any patient who pres&#173;ents with intermediate uveitis or pars planitis, as TNF inhibitors have been associated with exacerbations of MS.</p>
