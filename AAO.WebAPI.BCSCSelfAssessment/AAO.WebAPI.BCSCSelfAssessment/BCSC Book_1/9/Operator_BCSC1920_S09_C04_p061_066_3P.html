			<p class="h1">Animal Models of Human Uveitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Animal models of uveitis use a variety of species, antigens, adjuvants, and protocols to produce disease that ranges from transient to per&#173;sis&#173;tent and mild to severe. None is an exact corollary to &#173;human disease, but all have contributed substantially to the understanding of ocular immunology.</p>
			<p class="h2">Experimental Autoimmune Uveoretinitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is the most widely used and well-&#173;studied animal model of &#173;human uveitis. In the original model, a ret&#173;i&#173;nal extract administered intradermally with Freund complete adjuvant in rats and rabbits resulted in a panuveitis approximately 1–2 weeks &#173;later. Features include inflammation in the anterior segment, vitreous, and choroid. Refinements of the model have occurred over time. Purified arrestin (also called <span class="italic">S-antigen</span>) has been used in rats, and the model was expanded to include mice, using immunization with IRBP-&#173;derived peptides. Depending on the peptide dose used to induce disease, this mouse model can show monophasic active inflammation with vasculitis, papillitis, and intraret&#173;i&#173;nal infiltration that can result in ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration or a lower grade chronic inflammation with perivascular cuffing and choroidal infiltrates.</p>
			<p class="h2">Endotoxin-&#173;Induced Uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endotoxin-&#173;induced (also termed <span class="italic">experimental immune</span>) uveitis (EIU) is a transient uveitis model induced by footpad, intraperitoneal, or intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharide in mice and rats (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>). Sixteen to 48 hours &#173;after administration, a transient anterior uveitis develops. This model has been especially useful for studies of the dynamics of leukocyte function in the anterior chamber. It is not clear how or even if this model correlates with &#173;human disease.</p>
			<p class="h2">Equine Recurrent Uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This spontaneous uveitis occurs in up to 10% of &#173;horses. It is typically a bilateral uveitis featuring anterior and posterior segment inflammation. Immunologic studies have indicated the presence of autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells in this disease.</p>
			<p class="h2">Autoimmune Regulator–&#173;Deficient Mice</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The transcription &#173;factor AIRE (for <span class="italic">autoimmune regulator</span>) is used by the thymus in the pro&#173;cess of establishing thymic tolerance. Early in life, the thymus expresses many cell-&#173;type–&#173;specific proteins; T-cell clones reactive to &#173;these proteins are deleted. This mechanism is impor&#173;tant in the development of self-&#173;tolerance. Mice deficient in AIRE do not express &#173;these proteins during development; thus, autoreactive T cells escape deletion, and the mice spontaneously develop a posterior uveitis. Recent work has suggested that the major antigen targeted in this autoimmune uveitis is IRBP—&#173;the same protein used to generate mouse models of EAU.</p>
			<p class="h2">Interphotoreceptor Retinoid-&#173;Binding Protein–&#173;Specific <br />T-Cell Receptor Transgenic Mice</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Immunization of mice with a peptide sequence from IRBP induces autoimmune uveitis in mice. Mice bred to be transgenic for an IRBP-&#173;specific T-cell receptor develop a spontaneous uveitis that begins around 4 weeks of age and progresses to an incidence of 100% by age 12 weeks. &#173;These mice provide a model of spontaneous uveitis that negates the need for peripheral immunization and produces a chronic course, in contrast to the more acute disease of classic EAU.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">HLA Associations and Disease</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top3">
			<p class="h2">Normal Function of HLA Molecules</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All animals with white blood cells express a &#173;family of cell-&#173;surface glycoproteins called <span class="italic">major histocompatibility complex</span> (MHC) proteins. In &#173;humans, the MHC proteins are called <span class="italic">&#173;human leukocyte antigen</span> (HLA) molecules. Historically, 6 families of HLA mole&#173;cules have been identified:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">3 MHC class I: HLA-A, -&#173;B, -&#173;C</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">3 MHC class II: HLA-DR, -&#173;DP, -&#173;DQ</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Another category of HLA is HLA-D, whose subset, HLA-&#173;DM, is critical for loading and editing of peptides on MHC class II molecules. HLA-&#173;E, HLA-&#173;F and HLA-&#173;G are also relevant in immunity and subsequently in &#173;human pathology. Chapter&#160;2 discussed the impor&#173;tant role that MHC molecules play in immunologic function. HLA genes are also considered &#173;human immune response genes &#173;because the HLA type determines the capacity of the antigen-&#173;presenting cell (APC) to bind peptide fragments and pres&#173;ent it, and thus determines T-lymphocyte immune responsiveness.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Allelic Variation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Within the &#173;human population, many alleles exist for each of the 6 HLA types. &#173;Because each person has a pair of each HLA type (codominantly expressed), or 1 <span class="italic">haplotype</span>, an APC expresses pairs of MHC molecules. Thus, except for identical twins, only rarely &#173;will all potential haplotypes match between 2 individuals.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Allelic diversity provides protection through <span class="italic">population-&#173;wide immunity.</span> Each HLA haplotype covers a theoretical set of antigens against which an individual can respond. The presence of many dif&#173;fer&#173;ent HLA alleles within a population should thus ensure that the collective adaptive immune system can respond to a wide range of potential pathogens. The converse also holds true: some individuals may be at increased risk for immunologic diseases &#173;because of &#173;either an aberrantly strong immune response to a benign pathogen or an autoimmune disease arising from inappropriate recognition of host peptides in the context of a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar HLA being recognized as foreign. See <span class="xref-sidebar">Clinical </span><span class="xref-sidebar">Example 4-1</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical detection and classification of dif&#173;fer&#173;ent alleles</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Determination of HLA type has evolved from prior antisera reactions to molecular techniques that determine the nucleic acid sequence of MHC alleles. Molecules of HLA are composed of 2 chains: the <span class="greek">α </span>chain and <span class="greek">β</span> chain for class II, and the <span class="greek">α</span> chain and the <span class="greek">β</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;microglobulin chain for class I. Genotyping specifies the chain, major ge&#173;ne&#173;tic type, and specific minor molecular variant subtype. For example, genotype DRB1<span class="CharOverride-1">*</span>0408 refers to the HLA-DR4 molecule <span class="greek">β</span> chain with the “<span class="symbol">−</span>08” minor variant subtype. Haplotypes now recognized as a single group &#173;will continue to be subdivided into new categories or new subtypes as research progresses.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Disease Associations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In 1973, the first association between an HLA haplotype and a disease—&#173;ankylosing spondylitis—&#173;was identified. Since then, more than 100 other disease associations have been established, including several for ocular inflammatory diseases (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;4-1</span>). An HLA–&#173;disease association is established when &#173;there is a statistically increased frequency of an HLA haplotype in persons with that disease compared with the frequency in a disease-&#173;free population. The ratio of the probability of the disease occurring in individuals with the&#160;HLA haplotype to individuals without the haplotype is termed <span class="italic">relative risk.</span> A relative risk of 1 denotes no difference in risk, <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>1 indicates a reduced risk, and <span class="symbol">&gt;</span>1 an increased risk. Several points are impor&#173;tant when considering HLA–&#173;disease associations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">The HLA association identifies individuals at risk, but it is not a diagnostic marker. The associated haplotype is not necessarily pres&#173;ent in all &#173;people with the disease, nor does its presence in a person ensure the correct diagnosis.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The association depends on the validity of the haplotyping. Older lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture often reflects associations based on HLA classifications (some provisional) that might have changed.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The association is only as strong as the clinical diagnosis. Diseases that are difficult to diagnose based on clinical features may obscure real associations.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">The concept of <span class="bullet-list_italic">linkage disequilibrium</span> proposes that if 2 genes are physically close together on a chromosome, they are likely to be inherited together rather than undergo ge&#173;ne&#173;tic randomization in a population. Thus, HLA genes may be coinherited with a separate gene that confers the &#173;actual risk. Sometimes 2 HLA haplotypes can occur together more frequently than predicted by their in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent frequencies in the population.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">For example, approximately 8% of the Caucasian population in the United States is HLA-&#173;A29 positive, but fewer than 1&#160;in 10,000 US residents have birdshot chorioretinopathy (although nearly all patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy are HLA-&#173;A29 positive). Thus, most individuals who are HLA-&#173;A29 positive &#173;will never develop birdshot chorioretinopathy. This reinforces that other ge&#173;ne&#173;tic and environmental &#173;factors are implicated. As an example, genes encoding aminopeptidases involved in pro&#173;cessing of MHC class I ligands, namely endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase (ERAP), have been identified in genome-&#173;wide association studies of patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several mechanisms have been proposed for HLA-&#173;disease associations. The most direct theory postulates that HLA molecules act as peptide-&#173;binding molecules for etiologic antigens or infectious agents. Thus, individuals bearing a specific HLA molecule might be predisposed to pro&#173;cessing certain antigens, such as an infectious agent that cross-&#173;reacts with a self-&#173;antigen, and other individuals, lacking that haplotype, would not be so predisposed. Specific variations or mutations in the peptide-&#173;binding region would greatly influence this mechanism; only molecular typing can detect &#173;these variations. Preliminary data in support of this theory is available for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A second theory proposes molecular mimicry between bacterial antigens and an epitope on the HLA molecule (ie, an antigenic site on the molecule itself). An appropriate antibacterial effector response might inappropriately initiate a cross-&#173;reactive effector response with an epitope of the HLA molecule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A third theory suggests that the T-lymphocyte antigen receptor (gene) might be the true susceptibility &#173;factor. &#173;Because a specific T-lymphocyte receptor uses a specific HLA haplotype, a strong correlation would exist between an HLA and the T-lymphocyte antigen receptor repertoire.</p>

					<p class="sidebar-h2 ParaOverride-1"><span class="sidebar-h2">HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;associated acute anterior uveitis</span> Approximately 50% of patients with acute anterior uveitis express the HLA-B27 haplotype. Many of &#173;these patients also experience other immunologic disorders, such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriatic arthritis (see Chapter 8). Although the immunopathogenesis remains unknown, vari&#173;ous animal models permit some informed speculation. Many cases of uveitis or reactive arthritis follow gram-&#173;negative gastroenteritis or chlamydial infection. (Chapter&#160;1 discusses the pos&#173;si&#173;ble role of bacterial lipopolysaccharide and innate mechanisms.) Experiments in rats and mice genet&#173;ically altered to express &#173;human HLA-B27 molecules seem to suggest that bacterial infection of the gut predisposes rats to arthritis and a reactive arthritis–&#173;like syndrome, although uveitis is uncommon.</p>
