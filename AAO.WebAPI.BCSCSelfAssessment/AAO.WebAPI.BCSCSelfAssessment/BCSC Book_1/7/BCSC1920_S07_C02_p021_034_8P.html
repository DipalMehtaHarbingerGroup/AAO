			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">History</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The history establishes a probable diagnosis and guides the initial workup and therapy. It should include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">onset, course, and duration of symptoms (pain, altered sensation, diplopia, changes in vision) and signs (erythema, palpable mass, globe displacement)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">prior disease (eg, thyroid eye disease, sinus disease) and therapy</li>

				<li class="bullet-list-last">old photo&#173;graphs for establishing a timeline of the pro&#173;cess</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Pain</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pain may be a symptom of inflammatory or infectious lesions, orbital hemorrhage, malignant lacrimal gland tumors, invasion from adjacent nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or metastatic lesions.</p>
			<p class="h2">Progression</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The rate of progression can be a helpful diagnostic indicator. Conditions with onset occurring over days to weeks include nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI), scleritis, myositis, dacryoadenitis, orbital cellulitis, hemorrhage, thrombophlebitis, fulminant neoplasia (rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma), and metastatic tumors. Conditions with onset occurring over months to years include dermoid cyst, benign mixed tumor, neurogenic tumor, cavernous hemangioma, lymphoma, fibrous histiocytoma, fibrous dysplasia, or osteoma.</p>
			<p class="h2">Periorbital Changes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Periorbital changes may provide clues to the under&#173;lying disorders. For example, ecchymosis of the eyelid skin may be a sign of metastatic neuroblastoma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-1</span>), leukemia, or amyloidosis. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;2-1</span> lists vari&#173;ous periorbital signs and their common &#173;causes.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Physical Examination</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Special attention should be given to visual acuity, pupillary responses, color vision and visual field testing, ocular motility, globe position, and ophthalmoscopy. Diagnostic and imaging studies are often required in addition to the basic workup.</p>
			<p class="h2">Inspection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Globe displacement is the most common clinical manifestation of an orbital abnormality. It usually results from a tumor, a vascular abnormality, an inflammatory pro&#173;cess, or a traumatic event.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several terms are used to describe the position of the eye and orbit. <span class="italic">Proptosis</span> or <span class="italic">exophthalmos</span> denotes a forward displacement or protrusion of the globe. <span class="italic">Exorbitism</span> refers to an &#173;angle between the lateral orbital walls that is greater than 90°, which may also be associated with shallow orbital depth. This condition contrasts with <span class="italic">hypertelorism,</span> or <span class="italic">telorbitism,</span> which refers to a wider-&#173;than-&#173;normal separation between the medial orbital walls. Generally, exorbitism and hypertelorism are congenital or traumatic abnormalities. <span class="italic">Telecanthus</span> denotes an abnormal increased distance between the medial canthi. The eye may also be displaced vertically (<span class="italic">hyperglobus</span> or <span class="italic">hypoglobus</span>) or horizontally by an orbital mass. Retrodisplacement of the eye into the orbit, called <span class="italic">enophthalmos,</span> may occur as a result of volume expansion of the orbit (fracture, &#173;silent sinus syndrome), in association with orbital varix, or secondary to sclerosing orbital tumors (eg, metastatic breast carcinoma).</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because the globe is usually displaced away from the site of a mass, proptosis often indicates the location of that mass. Axial displacement is usually indicative of an intraconal mass &#173;behind the globe; such lesions include cavernous hemangioma, glioma, meningioma, metastases, and arteriovenous malformations. Nonaxial displacement is caused by lesions with a prominent component outside the muscle cone. Superior displacement is produced by maxillary sinus tumors invading the orbital floor and pushing the globe upward. Inferomedial displacement can result from orbital dermoid cysts and lacrimal gland tumors. Inferolateral displacement can result from frontoethmoidal mucoceles, abscesses, osteomas, and ethmoid sinus carcinomas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In adults, bilateral proptosis is caused most often by thyroid eye disease (TED); however, other disorders can also produce bilateral proptosis, including lymphoma, vasculitis, NSOI, metastatic tumors, carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and leukemic infiltrates. TED is also the most common cause of unilateral proptosis in adults. In &#173;children with bilateral proptosis, the clinician should consider TED, NSOI, metastatic neuroblastoma, or leukemic infiltrates. Unilateral proptosis in &#173;children should raise concern for orbital cellulitis, vascular malformation, and malignancy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Exophthalmometry is a mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the anterior-&#173;posterior position of the globe, generally from the lateral orbital rim to the anterior corneal surface (Hertel exophthalmometry, <span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-2A</span>). The Naugle exophthalmometer uses the frontal and maxillary bones as its reference structures (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig 2-2B</span>); this exophthalmometer is useful in trauma patients when the lateral orbital rim has been displaced or in patients who have had the lateral orbital rim removed as part of decompressive surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Globe position varies by gender and ethnicity. The mean normal values are 16.5&#160;mm in white males, 18.5&#160;mm in black males, 15.4&#160;mm in white females, and 17.8&#160;mm in black females. Asymmetry of greater than 2&#160;mm between an individual patient’s eyes suggests proptosis or enophthalmos. &#173;These conditions may best be appreciated clinically when the examiner looks up from below with the patient’s head tilted back (the so-&#173;called <span class="italic">worm’s-&#173;eye view</span>; <span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Pseudoproptosis</span> is &#173;either the simulation of abnormal prominence of the eye or a true asymmetry that is not the result of increased orbital contents. Diagnosis should be postponed &#173;until a mass lesion has been ruled out. &#173;Causes of pseudoproptosis include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">enlarged globe or irregular cornea (eg, axial myopia, staphyloma, keratoconus)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">contralateral enophthalmos (prior orbital trauma, surgery, &#173;silent sinus syndrome)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">asymmetric orbital size</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">asymmetric palpebral fissures (usually caused by ipsilateral eyelid retraction, facial nerve paralysis, or contralateral ptosis)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">congenital deformity (microphthalmia)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular movements may be restricted in a specific direction of gaze by neoplasm or inflammation. In TED, the inferior rectus is the muscle most commonly affected; this mechanically limits globe elevation and may cause hypotropia in primary gaze and restriction of upgaze. A large or rapidly enlarging orbital mass can also impede ocular movements, even in the absence of direct muscle invasion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Eyelid abnormalities are common in TED. The <span class="italic">von Graefe sign</span> is a delay in the upper eyelid’s descent (“lid lag”) during downgaze and is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of TED. In fact, such lid lag and the retraction of the upper and lower eyelids are the most common physical signs of TED (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span>&#160;in this volume).</p>

			<p class="h2">Palpation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Palpation around the globe may disclose the presence of a mass in the anterior orbit, especially if the lacrimal gland is enlarged. Increased re&#173;sis&#173;tance to retrodisplacement of the globe is a nonspecific abnormality that may result &#173;either from a retrobulbar tumor or from diffuse inflammation such as that seen in TED. The physician should also palpate regional lymph nodes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis for a palpable mass in the superonasal quadrant may include mucocele, mucopyocele, encephalocele, neurofibroma, dermoid cyst, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, or amyloid. A palpable mass in the superotemporal quadrant may be a prolapsed lacrimal gland, a dermoid cyst, a lacrimal gland tumor, lymphoma, or NSOI. A lesion &#173;behind the equator of the globe is usually not palpable.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pulsation of the eye is caused by transmission of the vascular pulse through the orbit. This may result from &#173;either abnormal vascular flow or transmission of normal intracranial pulsations through a bony defect in the orbital walls. Abnormal vascular flow may be caused by arteriovenous communications, such as carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas. Defects in the bony orbital walls may result from sinus mucoceles, surgical removal of bone, trauma, or developmental abnormalities, including encephalocele, meningocele, or sphenoid wing dysplasia (associated with neurofibromatosis).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Primary Studies</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the primary studies for evaluation of orbital disorders. Ultrasonography (echography) may also be helpful for some disorders.</p>
			<p class="h2">Computed Tomography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Computed tomography is essential in the management of orbital disorders. Tissues in a tomographic plane are assigned a density value proportional to their coefficient of absorption of x-&#173;rays. &#173;Either 2-&#173; or 3-&#173;dimensional images are digitally constructed from &#173;these density mea&#173;sure&#173;ments.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CT is the most valuable technique for delineating the shape, location, extent, and character of lesions in the orbit (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-4</span>). CT helps refine the differential diagnosis; and when orbitotomy is indicated, CT helps guide the se&#173;lection of the surgical approach by showing the relationship of the lesion to the surgical space or spaces of the orbit. The resolution and soft-&#173;tissue contrast of CT are adequate for visualizing nearly all pathologic pro&#173;cesses in the orbit, and the bony resolution is superior to that provided by any other modality, making CT the imaging technique of choice for orbital trauma and bony tumors. Orbital CT scans are usually obtained in 3-mm sections (as opposed to the thicker 5-mm sections typically utilized in head CT scans). For greater detail, fine cuts at 1.0-mm intervals may be requested.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The visualization of tumors that are highly vascularized (eg, meningioma) or that have altered vascular permeability is improved by the use of intravenous contrast-&#173;enhancing agents. Contrast is also helpful to identify an orbital abscess. If contrast is desired, it must be specifically ordered as part of the study. The resolution and tissue-&#173;contrast capabilities of CT allow imaging not only of bone but also of soft tissue and foreign bodies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Orbital images can be obtained in the <span class="italic">axial plane,</span> parallel to the course of the optic nerve; in the <span class="italic">coronal plane,</span> showing the eye, optic nerve, and extraocular muscles in cross section; or in the <span class="italic">sagittal plane,</span> parallel to the nasal septum. CT scanners use software to reconstruct (reformat) any section in any direction (axial, coronal, or sagittal). Modern <span class="italic">spiral (helical) CT scanners</span> have multiple detector ports, and the scanner and the collecting tube move in a spiral fashion around the patient, generating a continuous data set. This results in rapid acquisition of a larger volume of data that allows highly detailed reconstructions in all imaging planes. <span class="italic">Direct coronal scans</span> are ideal for evaluation of the optic nerve and extraocular muscles as well as the bony roof and floor of the orbit. <span class="italic">Three-&#173;dimensional </span><span class="italic">CT</span> allows reformatting of CT information into 3-&#173;dimensional projections of the bony orbital walls (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-5</span>). &#173;Because this type of imaging requires thin sections and additional computer time, it is typically reserved for use in preparation for craniofacial surgery or repairs of complex orbital fractures.</p>
			<p class="h2">Magnetic Resonance Imaging</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique that does not employ ionizing radiation and has no known adverse biological effects (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-6</span>). MRI is based on the interaction of 3 physical components: atomic nuclei possessing an electrical charge, radiofrequency (RF) waves, and a power&#173;ful magnetic field.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When tissue that contains hydrogen atoms is placed in the magnetic field, individual nuclei align themselves in the direction of the magnetic field. &#173;These aligned nuclei can be excited by an RF pulse emitted from a coil lying within the magnetic field. Excited nuclei align themselves against the static magnetic field; as the RF pulse is terminated, the nuclei flip back to their original magnetized position. The time that this realignment takes (the relaxation time) can be mea&#173;sured.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Each orbital tissue has specific magnetic resonance (MR) par&#173;ameters that provide the information used to generate an image. &#173;These par&#173;ameters include tissue proton density and relaxation times. <span class="italic">Proton density</span> is determined by the number of protons per unit volume of tissue. Fat has greater proton density per unit volume than bone and, therefore, greater signal intensity. <span class="italic">T1,</span> or longitudinal relaxation time, is the time required for the net bulk magnetization to realign itself along the original axis. <span class="italic">T2,</span> or transverse relaxation time, is the mean relaxation time based on the interaction of hydrogen nuclei within a given tissue, an indirect mea&#173;sure of the effect the nuclei have on one another. Each tissue has dif&#173;fer&#173;ent proton density and T1 and T2 characteristics, providing the image contrast necessary to differentiate tissues. Healthy tissue can have imaging characteristics dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from &#173;those of diseased tissue, a good example being the bright signal associated with tissue edema seen on T2-&#173;weighted scans.</p>
			<p class="body-text">MRI is usually performed with images created from both T1 and T2 par&#173;ameters. T1-&#173;weighted images generally offer the best anatomic detail of the orbit. T2-&#173;weighted images have the advantage of showing methemoglobin brighter than melanin, whereas &#173;these substances have the same signal intensity on T1-&#173;weighted images. The difference in brightness seen on T2-&#173;weighted images can be helpful in differentiating melanotic lesions from hemorrhagic pro&#173;cesses. <span class="italic">Gadolinium,</span> a paramagnetic contrast agent given intravenously, allows enhancement of vascularized lesions so that they exhibit the same density as fat. It also enhances lesions that have abnormal vascular permeability. Special MR sequences have been developed to suppress the normal bright signal of fat on T1-&#173;weighted images (fat suppression; see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig 2-6</span>) and the bright signal of cerebrospinal fluid on T2-&#173;weighted images (fluid-&#173;attenuated inversion recovery, or FLAIR). <span class="italic">Gradient echo sequences</span> may reveal hemorrhage in vascular malformations that might be missed on T1-&#173; and T2-&#173;weighted images.</p>
			<p class="h2">Comparison of CT and MRI</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although both CT and MRI are impor&#173;tant modalities for the detection and characterization of orbital and ocular diseases, CT is currently the primary and most useful orbital imaging technique. Compared with MRI, it is faster, less expensive, and less sensitive to motion artifact. In general, CT provides better spatial resolution, allowing precise localization of a lesion. MRI generally provides better tissue contrast than CT; however, in most orbital disorders, the orbital fat provides sufficient natu&#173;ral tissue contrast to allow ready visualization of orbital tumors on CT. Each of the techniques has advantages in specific situations, some of which are discussed in the following text and in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;2-2</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">MRI offers advantages over CT in some situations. It allows the direct display of anatomic information in multiple planes (sagittal, axial, coronal, and any oblique plane). MRI provides better soft-&#173;tissue definition than does CT, a capability that is especially helpful in the evaluation of demyelination and in vascular and hemorrhagic lesions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-7</span>). As with CT, contrast agents are available to improve MRI detail.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Compared with CT, MRI also provides better tissue contrast of structures in the orbital apex, intracanalicular portion of the optic nerve, structures in periorbital spaces, and orbitocranial tumors, &#173;because &#173;there is no artifact from the skull-&#173;base bones. Bone and calcification produce low signal on MRI. Bony structures may be evaluated by visualization of the signal void left by the bone. However, this is not pos&#173;si&#173;ble when the bone is adjacent to structures that also create a signal void, such as air, rapidly flowing blood, calcification, and dura mater. Thus, CT is superior to MRI for the evaluation of fractures, bone destruction, and tissue calcification.</p>
			<p class="body-text">MRI is contraindicated in patients who have ferromagnetic metallic foreign bodies in the orbit or periorbital soft tissue, ferromagnetic vascular clips from previous surgery, magnetic intravascular filters, or electronic devices in the body such as cardiac pacemakers. If necessary, the presence of such foreign material can be ruled out with plain film x-&#173;ray or CT. Certain types of eye makeup can produce artifacts and should be removed prior to MRI. Dental amalgam is not a ferromagnetic substance and is not a contraindication to MRI, but this material produces artifacts and degrades the images on both MRI and CT.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because CT and MRI yield dif&#173;fer&#173;ent types of images, it is not unusual for both techniques to be employed in the evaluation of an orbital disorder. The use of &#173;these modalities should be based on the specific patient’s condition. In most cases, CT is the more effective and eco&#173;nom&#173;ical choice (see <span class="xref-table-local">&#173;Table&#160;2-2</span>). MRI is the better primary technique for imaging the orbitocranial junction and brain, but CT scanning may enhance the assessment by providing better bone images. When the orbitocranial junction or brain is involved, CT scanning and MRI may be complementary; and in some cases, both may be required to evaluate complex lesions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CT imaging should be obtained judiciously in &#173;children, as they are much more radiosensitive than adults. Extrapolation of lifetime risk of malignancy development from atomic bomb survivors led to a consensus statement that low-&#173;level radiation may have a small risk of causing cancer. When pos&#173;si&#173;ble, MRI should be considered first for &#173;children, with CT reserved for select clinical scenarios.</p>

Radiation risk to &#173;children from computed tomography. <span class="reference--non-journal-_italic">Pediatrics</span>. 2007;<br />120(3):677–682.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Ultrasonography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital ultrasonography may be used to examine patients with orbital disorders. The size, shape, and position of normal and abnormal orbital tissues can be determined by means of con&#173;temporary ultrasound techniques. B-&#173;scan ultrasonography captures 2-&#173;dimensional images of &#173;these tissues, while standardized A-&#173;scan ultrasonography provides 1-&#173;dimensional images rendered as a series of spikes of varying height and width that demonstrate the par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar echogenic characteristics of each tissue. Areas of edema can sometimes be used to discern the degree of disease activity. Ultrasonography has high resolution in the area of the sclera and optic nerve insertion and is useful for evaluating scleritis and other types of anterior inflammation that produce fluid in the sub-&#173;Tenon space. Localization of foreign bodies is pos&#173;si&#173;ble with ultrasonography. <span class="italic">Doppler ultrasonography</span> can provide specific information regarding blood flow and can demonstrate arterialization, retrograde flow in the orbital veins in cases of dural cavernous fistula or arteriovenous malformation, or vascular abnormalities associated with increased blood flow. Vascular tumors can be identified by active pulsation or, in the case of venous lesions, by compressibility and change in size with the Valsalva maneuver.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, ultrasound analy&#173;sis of orbital tissues and diseases requires specialized equipment and experienced personnel, and office-&#173;based equipment is generally not suitable for this purpose. Ultrasonography is of limited value in assessing lesions of the posterior orbit (&#173;because of sound attenuation) or the sinuses or intracranial space (&#173;because sound does not pass well through air or bone).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Secondary Studies</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Secondary studies that are performed for specific indications include venography, arteriography, and stereotactic navigation. Although &#173;these studies are rarely used, they may be helpful in specific cases.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Venography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before the advent of CT and MRI, orbital venography was used in the diagnosis and management of orbital varices and in the study of the cavernous sinus. Contrast material is injected into the frontal or the angular vein to reveal a venous abnormality. Subtraction and magnification techniques have been used to increase the resolution of venography. &#173;Because moving blood generates a signal void during MR imaging, larger venous abnormalities and structures can be visualized well on MR venography. Some orbitocranial vascular malformations or fistulas are best accessed directly via the superior ophthalmic vein, both for diagnosis and for pos&#173;si&#173;ble treatment.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Arteriography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Arteriography is the gold standard for diagnosis of an arterial lesion such as an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation. Retrograde catheterization of the ce&#173;re&#173;bral vessels is performed through the femoral artery. However, &#173;there is a small risk of serious neurologic and vascular complications (1%–2%) &#173;because the technique requires installation of a catheter and injection of radiopaque dye into the arterial system; thus, the test is reserved for patients with a high probability of having a lesion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Visualization can be maximized by the use of selective injection into the internal and external carotid arteries, magnification to allow viewing of the smaller-&#173;caliber vessels, and subtraction techniques to radiographically eliminate bone. An additional benefit of arteriography is the ability to si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously diagnose and embolize lesions using vari&#173;ous glues and coils.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">CT and MR Angiography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The development of better hardware and software has enabled precise CT and MR &#173;imaging for diagnosis of arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, and arteriovenous fistulas without the expense, discomfort, and risks associated with intravascular catheterization use of contrast agents. MR angiography is useful for diagnosis of vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia seen in hemifacial spasm. However, MR angiography is less sensitive than direct catheter angiography for identifying carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas. When determining which test to use, the ophthalmologist may consult with a radiologist to discuss the suspected lesion and to ensure se&#173;lection of the imaging modality best suited to the patient.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Stereotactic Navigation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The use of computer-&#173;assisted 3-&#173;dimensional navigation (image guidance) is increasingly common in clinical practice (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-8</span>). Stereotactic guidance can be useful when performing complex multidisciplinary surgeries in which orbital lesions are accessed through craniotomy and endoscopic skull-&#173;base approaches. However, in uncomplicated orbital surgery, while image guidance may have some utility for surgical training, it has a lesser role in procedures performed by experienced orbital surgeons.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Pathology</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diagnosis of an orbital lesion usually requires analy&#173;sis of tissue obtained through an orbitotomy. Appropriate &#173;handling of the tissue specimen is necessary to ensure an accurate diagnosis. Most tissue samples are placed in formalin for permanent section analy&#173;sis. If a lymphoproliferative lesion is suspected, some fresh tissue should be sent for flow cytometry analy&#173;sis. Frozen section evaluation may be performed at the time of surgery, but it is generally not used for definitive diagnosis of an orbital tumor. However, when the area of proposed biopsy is not obvious, frozen sections are helpful to confirm that appropriate tissue has been obtained for permanent section analy&#173;sis. Frozen section analy&#173;sis is also used intraoperatively to determine tumor margins and ensure complete tumor removal. Tissue removed for frozen section analy&#173;sis should be placed in a dampened saline gauze and sent promptly to the frozen section laboratory.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because of the vast array of pos&#173;si&#173;ble unusual tumor types in the orbit, preoperative consultation with a pathologist familiar with orbital disease may be helpful to maximize the information gained from any orbital biopsy. In many cases, fresh tissue should be obtained and frozen for cell-&#173;surface-&#173;marker studies. Cell-&#173;marker studies are required in the analy&#173;sis of all orbital lymphoid lesions. &#173;These studies may allow differentiation between reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphoma. Such studies may also indicate the presence of estrogen receptors in cases of metastatic prostate or breast carcinoma and thus provide useful information about sensitivity to hormonal therapy. Marker studies are also helpful in the diagnosis of poorly differentiated tumors when light microscopy alone is not definitive. Although cell-&#173;marker studies have largely replaced electron microscopy in the diagnosis of undifferentiated tumors, it may nevertheless be worthwhile in &#173;these cases to preserve fresh tissue in glutaraldehyde for pos&#173;si&#173;ble electron microscopy. In noncohesive tumors (hematologic or lymphoid), a touch preparation may permit a diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All biopsy specimens must be treated delicately to minimize crush and cautery artifacts, which can confuse interpretation. Permanent section tissue biopsy specimens should be placed in fixatives promptly. If fine-&#173;needle aspiration biopsy is planned, a cytologist or trained technician must be available to &#173;handle the aspirate. In special cases, the biopsy can be performed &#173;under &#173;either ultrasonographic or CT control. Although a fine-&#173;bore needle occasionally yields a sufficient cell block, the specimen is usually limited to cytologic study. Larger biopsy specimens, in which light and electron microscopy can be used to evaluate histologic patterns, may permit a more conclusive diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As the technology improves and costs decrease, genomic analy&#173;sis of tumors is increasingly being performed. This modality has implications for disease prognosis and the promise of precision therapy. Discussion with the pathologist prior to surgery is recommended so that tissues can be sent in the appropriate media for optimal ge&#173;ne&#173;tic analy&#173;sis.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Screening for abnormal thyroid function commonly includes T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> and thyroid-&#173;stimulating hormone (TSH) tests. Results of &#173;these serum tests are abnormal in 90% of patients with TED. However, if the results are normal but thyroid disease is still strongly suspected, additional endocrine studies such as thyroid-&#173;stimulating immunoglobulins or TSH-&#173;receptor antibodies can be considered, as &#173;these tests have greater sensitivity for detecting thyroid disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener granulomatosis; see <span class="xref-local">Chapter 4</span>&#160;in this volume) should be considered in patients with sclerokeratitis or coexisting sinus disease and orbital mass lesions. A useful test for this uncommon disease is the antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) serum assay, which shows a cytoplasmic staining pattern (c-&#173;ANCA) in cases of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. However, the test results may initially be negative in cases of localized disease. Biopsy of affected tissues classically shows vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation, and tissue necrosis, although necrotizing vasculitis is not always pres&#173;ent in orbital biopsies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Testing for serum angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme (ACE) and lysozyme may be helpful in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. This multisystem granulomatous inflammatory condition may pres&#173;ent with lacrimal gland enlargement, conjunctival granulomas, extraocular muscle or optic nerve infiltration, or solitary orbital granulomas. Diagnosis is confirmed through biopsy of one or more affected organs.</p>
