			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Pathogenesis of the Aging Face</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An individual’s facial contours and appearance are derived from soft tissue draped over under&#173;lying bone. The soft-&#173;tissue component consists of skin, subcutaneous fat, muscle, deeper fat pads, and fascial layers. The under&#173;lying structural ele&#173;ment is composed of bone, cartilage, and teeth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As the face ages, the soft-&#173;tissue component descends, and the bone component loses mass. With &#173;these changes, relatively more soft tissue hangs from its attachments to the bone. Loss of subcutaneous fat, skin atrophy, and descent of facial fat pads compound this facial sagging. Around the eyes, the lateral brow typically descends more than the medial brow, which leads to temporal hooding. The orbital septum attenuates, allowing fat to prolapse forward. In the lower eyelid, midface descent produces the skeletonization of the infraorbital rim and increases the prominence of the orbital fat. Sagging of the platysma muscle in the neck posterior to the mandibular ligament gives rise to jowling.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Physical Examination of the Aging Face</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-6">Much of the surgeon’s appraisal of the aging face can be performed through close observation during the introduction and history phase of the initial meeting. The surgeon should observe the patient’s hairstyle, including the presence or absence of bangs, hair thickness, and the height of the hairline; the use of the frontalis; the position of the brow; the texture and quality of the facial skin; and the presence and location of rhytids, telangiectasias, pigmentary dyschromia, and expressive furrows.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If chemical peeling or &#173;laser skin resurfacing is being considered, the surgeon should also note the patient’s Fitzpatrick skin type, which affects the skin’s response to &#173;these procedures. The Fitzpatrick scale classifies skin into 6 types according to skin color (before sun exposure) and the reaction of the skin to sun exposure. The higher the number is, the greater the amount of skin pigment. Thus, Fitzpatrick type I refers to fair skin with minimal pigmentation, and type VI represents skin with marked pigmentation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, the surgeon should assess eyelid skin and fat along with eyelid margin position relative to the pupil and cornea, presence or absence of horizontal lower eyelid laxity, midface position, presence of jowling, accumulation of subcutaneous fat in the neck, and chin position, noting any nasal deformities, tip descent, or broadening, as well as thinning of the lips. The surgeon may find a side view of the neck to be particularly helpful in determining the extent of aging. Preoperative photo&#173;graphs should be available in the operating room.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Nonsurgical Facial Rejuvenation</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nonsurgical facial rejuvenation techniques such as &#173;laser resurfacing, soft-&#173;tissue dermal fillers, neurotoxin injection, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion are used to treat involutional and actinic facial skin changes. &#173;These superficial procedures may precede or be combined with surgical procedures that reposition deeper structures. It is impor&#173;tant to remember that the upper eyelid appearance is inextricably linked to the position of the eyebrow. Similarly, the lower eyelid appearance is linked to the position of the midface, as well as the lower face and neck. Subunits of the facial cosmetic superstructure should not be viewed or manipulated individually but must be addressed in the context of the entire face and neck.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">&#173;Laser Skin Resurfacing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Laser skin resurfacing, a technology pop&#173;u&#173;lar&#173;ized in the early 1990s, is designed to reduce wrinkles and enhance the texture and appearance of the facial and periorbital skin. A variety of &#173;lasers have been developed to perform &#173;laser resurfacing; superpulsed or ultrapulsed carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">2</span>) and erbium:yttrium-&#173;aluminum-&#173;garnet (Er:YAG) &#173;lasers are the most widely used. The development of superpulsed CO<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">2</span> &#173;lasers has allowed ablative skin resurfacing without excessive thermal damage. Superpulsed and ultrapulsed CO<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">2</span> &#173;lasers deliver small pulses of high-&#173;energy light to the skin; pauses between &#173;these pulses allow cooling of the tissues in the treated area, minimizing the risk of thermal damage. The Er:YAG &#173;laser has a nearly pure ablative effect on collagen and water-&#173;containing tissues, with a much smaller zone of thermal injury and much less heat transfer into the tissues than the CO<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">2</span> &#173;lasers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Laser resurfacing is a useful adjunct to lower blepharoplasty. The skin-&#173;shrinking, collagen-&#173;tightening effect of &#173;laser skin resurfacing often allows the surgeon to avoid making an external incision and removing skin.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patient se&#173;lection is vital for successful &#173;laser skin resurfacing. Patients with a fair complexion and generally healthy, well-&#173;hydrated skin are ideal candidates. Patients with greater degrees of skin pigmentation can be safely treated, but care and caution are needed. The darker the skin pigmentation is, the greater the risk of postoperative inflammatory hyperpigmentation. &#173;Contraindications include inappropriate, unrealistic expectations, the presence of collagen vascular disease such as active systemic lupus erythematosus, and significant uncorrected lower eyelid laxity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Herpes simplex virus infection &#173;after &#173;laser resurfacing may lead to scarring; therefore, most surgeons prophylactically treat patients with suppressing doses of antiviral agents against outbreaks of herpes simplex virus. Other complications associated with &#173;laser skin resurfacing include a variety of ophthalmic prob&#173;lems such as lagophthalmos, exposure keratitis, corneal injury, ectropion, and lower eyelid retraction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A desire to improve superficial skin characteristics and facial wrinkling without the prolonged period of healing and erythema seen with ablative &#173;laser skin resurfacing has led to the development of devices that use fractionated &#173;lasers, intense pulsed light, ultrasound, or radiofrequency to deliver energy to the skin. &#173;These modalities can potentially even skin tone, remove cutaneous dyschromias or fine wrinkles, and even lift and smooth facial tissues. Each of &#173;these devices has its own risks and limitations but offers some improvement in aspects of facial aging, with fewer risks and shorter recovery times than with ablative &#173;laser skin resurfacing.</p>

			<p class="h2">Cosmetic Uses of Botulinum Toxin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The use of botulinum toxin in patients with blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm (HFS) led to the observation that botulinum toxin reduces or eliminates some facial wrinkles. The first neurotoxin available for aesthetic indications was onabotulinumtoxinA, which already had a long history of ophthalmic use in the treatment of blepharospasm and HFS. The US FDA approved it to temporarily reduce wrinkles in the glabellar area, the lateral canthal lines (crow’s-&#173;feet), and the forehead. AbobotulinumtoxinA, the second neurotoxin to become available in the United States, has also been approved for the treatment of wrinkles in the glabellar area. IncobotulinumtoxinA has been approved for both cosmetic and medical applications. A number of non–&#173;FDA-&#173;approved botulinum toxin products are available worldwide; however, US physicians should recognize the significant risks associated with using a non–&#173;FDA-&#173;approved substance for injection. Also, unit potency differs among &#173;these products, requiring that careful dosing adjustments be made.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Apart from the glabella, the areas most amenable to neuromodulation are the forehead, lateral canthal lines, perioral rhytids, and platysmal bands. The amount of botulinum toxin required and the location of injections vary significantly among patients and should be individualized.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The eyebrow can be chemically lifted when botulinum toxin is injected into the depressors of the eyebrow. The corners of the mouth can be elevated with injection into the depressor anguli oris muscle. The onset of action, peak effect, duration of effect, and complications of botulinum toxin for cosmetic purposes are the same as &#173;those noted for botulinum toxin as therapy for benign essential blepharospasm in Chapter&#160;12 of this volume.</p>

			<p class="h2">Soft-&#173;Tissue Dermal Fillers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many formulations of fillers are available for nonsurgical facial rejuvenation. Bovine collagen was initially approved by the FDA in 1995. However, its use required patch skin testing for pos&#173;si&#173;ble allergic response. With the increased use of hyaluronic acid fillers derived from bacteria, bovine collagen usage has since declined. Hyaluronic acid fillers do not require allergy testing and have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of facial wrinkles or folds such as the nasolabial folds (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-1</span>), for lip augmentation, and to correct age-&#173;related volume loss in the cheek area. Off-&#173;label usage of hyaluronic acid fillers for the periocular region (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-2</span>) has been described extensively in the lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture, but &#173;these fillers must be used with care. Complications from intravascular injection, including regional soft-&#173;tissue necrosis and central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion, have been reported. In central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion, retrograde embolization follows inadvertent high-&#173;pressure injection into an artery (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;9</span>, Fig&#160;9-9).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Autologous Fat Grafting</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The use of autologous fat transfer was first reported in 1893 by Neuber. With the advent of liposuction and refinements in the technique, this procedure has evolved into a safe and predictable means of restoring facial volume. Its biocompatibility makes fat an ideal filler. Any area treatable with the commercial dermal fillers discussed in the previous section is potentially treatable with fat grafting. &#173;These areas include, but are not &#173;limited to, the periocular area, &#173;temples, forehead, brow, cheeks, midface, lips, nasolabial fold, jawline, submental crease, and chin. As with commercial dermal filler injection, fat grafting carries the risk of intravascular injection. Additionally, fat grafts can exhibit variable growth, resorption, or palpability if injected too superficially.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-13">Surgical Facial Rejuvenation</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Facial and eyelid surgery should be approached with care. Adequate preoperative preparation includes properly informing the patient of the proposed benefits as well as the potential complications of the procedure. Significant complications—&#173;including facial nerve paralysis, skin flap necrosis, and vision loss—&#173;are potential risks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Rejuvenation of the aging face requires a multitude of techniques. Chemical peeling, &#173;laser resurfacing, dermabrasion, and liposculpting can enhance the results of surgery, or, at times, may be preferred to incisional surgery.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Lower Blepharoplasty</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lower eyelid rejuvenation is considered an aesthetic operation and is discussed in Chapter&#160;12&#160;in this volume.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Forehead Rejuvenation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many options are available for forehead rejuvenation (see the section Brow Ptosis in Chapter&#160;12).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Midface Rejuvenation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The entire midface should be evaluated in a patient presenting for lower eyelid blepharoplasty. With age, cheek tissue descends, and orbital fat herniates, creating a double-&#173;convexity deformity (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-3</span>). Attenuation of the orbitomalar, masseteric cutaneous, and zygomatic ligaments are the pathologic changes that occur with midfacial ptosis. Elevation of the suborbicularis oculi fat (SOOF) and midface, combined with conservative fat removal or re&#173;distribution, can restore the youthful anterior projection of the midface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Midface elevation can be achieved through a preperiosteal or subperiosteal approach. The preperiosteal plane can be accessed through the lower eyelid, with or without release of the lateral canthal tendon, or by using the temporal scalp incision employed in an endoscopic brow-&#173;lift (endobrow). The subperiosteal midface can also be accessed through &#173;these incisions or through a superior gingival sulcus incision (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-4</span>). The goal of &#173;these procedures is to provide release of the midface tissues, followed by elevation and resuspension. Midface elevation is commonly combined with additional procedures such as a brow-&#173;lift, lower face-&#173;lift, or volume augmentation.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-15">Lower Face and Neck Rejuvenation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">During preoperative evaluation, the face and neck should be considered as a single cosmetic unit. Correction of the cosmetic subunits of the upper face and midface without addressing the lower face and neck can create an un&#173;balanced appearance. At the very least, &#173;these concerns must be discussed with the patient preoperatively, along with surgical options.</p>
			<p class="h3">Rhytidectomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most commonly performed procedures include the vintage (subcutaneous) rhytidectomy, the rhytidectomy with superficial elevation and refixation of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-5</span>), and the deep-&#173;plane rhytidectomy. Rhytidectomies typically include surgical management of the jowls and neck, including liposuction with or without platysmaplasty (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-6</span>). The 3 rhytidectomy procedures mentioned differ mainly in the location and extent of dissection. Although the more superficial procedures are less likely to cause facial nerve damage, they may produce shorter-&#173;lasting results. The more extensive procedures have greater risks (eg, facial nerve injury), but the likelihood that they &#173;will produce dramatic, longer-&#173;lasting improvement is also greater.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Complications of rhytidectomy are directly related to the extent of subcutaneous undermining; they include hematoma, seroma, skin necrosis, hair loss, paresthesias, motor deficits, incisional scarring, asymmetry, earlobe distraction (pixie-&#173;ear deformity), and contour irregularities. Hematoma is the leading surgical face-&#173;lift complication, but patient dissatisfaction may be the most common issue postoperatively.</p>
			<p class="h3">Neck liposuction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neck liposuction enhances the neckline and is often done in conjunction with other cosmetic procedures. Stab incisions, or <span class="italic">adits,</span> are made just posterior to the earlobe on each side and along the submental incision line; if liposuction is performed as a stand-&#173;alone procedure, they are made just anterior to the submental crease. Small liposuction cannulas are used for fat removal. A layer of fat is left on the dermis, and the liposuction cannula openings are always oriented away from the dermis to avoid injury to the vascular plexus deep to the dermis. In addition to abnormalities in skin quality, damage in this area can lead to unsightly scarring of the dermis of the under&#173;lying neck musculature. The adits are left open or sutured, and a compression ban&#173;dage is worn for 1 week &#173;after the procedure.</p>
			<p class="h3">Platysmaplasty</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Platysmaplasty is performed to correct platysmal bands and is typically done in conjunction with a lower face-&#173;lift. A subcutaneous dissection is carried out in the preplatysmal plane centrally &#173;under the chin to the level of the thyroid cartilage (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-7A</span>). Lateral platysmal undermining and suspension may be performed as part of a rhytidectomy. Midline platysma resection and reconstruction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-7B</span>) are performed if midline neck support is needed. A drain and a light compression dressing are placed. Postoperatively, the cervicomental &#173;angle is more acute, yielding a more youthful look.</p>
