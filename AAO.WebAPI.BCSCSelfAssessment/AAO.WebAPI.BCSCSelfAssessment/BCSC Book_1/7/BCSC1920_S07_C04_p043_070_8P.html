				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-4">Orbital inflammatory disease comprises a broad range of disorders that can be divided conceptually into &#173;those that have an identifiable cause (specific) and &#173;those that do not (nonspecific).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">All specific &#173;causes of orbital inflammation, such as infections or autoimmune diseases, must be eliminated before applying a diagnosis of nonspecific orbital inflammation.</li>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Infectious Inflammation</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Cellulitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most cases of cellulitis stem from bacterial infection; however, cellulitis resulting from noninfectious (eg, autoimmune, malignant, foreign-&#173;body) etiologies may mimic bacterial cellulitis. Defining the etiology of the cellulitis allows prompt and effective treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Bacterial infections of the orbit or periorbital soft tissues originate from 3 primary sources:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">direct spread from adjacent sinusitis, dacryocystitis, dacryoadenitis, or an odontogenic infection</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">direct inoculation &#173;after trauma or skin infection</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">hematologic spread from a distant focus (eg, otitis media, pneumonia, endocarditis)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Preseptal cellulitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Preseptal cellulitis involves structures anterior to the orbital septum. Eyelid edema, erythema, and inflammation may be severe, but the globe and deep orbital tissues remain uninvolved (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-1</span>). Therefore, pupillary reaction, vision, ocular motility, and globe position are not disturbed. Furthermore, pain on eye movement and chemosis are noticeably absent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although preseptal cellulitis in adults usually arises from penetrating cutaneous trauma or dacryocystitis, in &#173;children, it commonly arises from under&#173;lying sinusitis. Most pediatric cases are now caused by gram-&#173;positive cocci, but <span class="italic">Haemophilus influenzae</span> type B should still be considered, especially in nonimmunized &#173;children.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> Antibiotic therapy and workup should begin as promptly as pos&#173;si&#173;ble, particularly in &#173;children. If eyelid swelling precludes motility evaluation and, thus, the ability to exclude orbital cellulitis, workup should include computed tomography (CT) imaging of the orbit and sinuses. An optimal antibiotic regimen may be developed in collaboration with the patient’s primary care physician or an infectious disease specialist.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In &#173;children with a reliable examination and follow-up plan, oral antibiotics (eg, cephalexin for an anterior etiology; amoxicillin clavulanate for a sinusitis-&#173;associated infection), frequent warm compresses, and nasal decongestants (eg, oxymetazoline nasal spray) for associated sinusitis typically improve the infection. For infants, &#173;children with an unreliable examination or follow-up plan, or for infections that pro&#173;gress on oral antibiotics, hospital admission and intravenous (IV) antibiotics (eg, ceftriaxone, vancomycin) may be considered.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In teen&#173;agers and adults, preseptal cellulitis usually arises from a superficial source and responds quickly to appropriate oral antibiotics (eg, ampicillin-&#173;sulbactam, trimethoprim-&#173;sulfamethoxazole [TMP-&#173;SMX], doxycycline, clindamycin) and warm compresses. Initial antibiotic se&#173;lection depends on the history, clinical findings, and initial laboratory studies. Prompt culture and sensitivity studies allow for revising antibiotic therapy in unresponsive cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In older adults, infections behave differently and may not produce typical signs, such as erythema, calor, or fever. Response to antibiotics in patients in this age group may also be delayed, and surgical intervention to excise devitalized tissue may be necessary to clear an infection. Imaging studies and hospital admission for IV antibiotics should be considered to rule out under&#173;lying sinusitis if no direct inoculation site is identified, if the patient does not respond to oral antibiotics within 48 hours, or if orbital involvement becomes evident.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Preseptal cellulitis in any age group may require surgical drainage if it progresses to a localized abscess (see Fig 4-1). Incision and drainage directly over the abscess typically improve the infection, but dissection of the upper eyelid should preserve the orbital septum to avoid contaminating the orbital soft tissues and to prevent injury to the under&#173;lying levator aponeurosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with preseptal cellulitis resulting from trauma, <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> represents the most common pathogen. The infection usually responds rapidly to a penicillin used against penicillinase-&#173;resistant organisms, such as methicillin or ampicillin-&#173;sulbactam. However, <span class="italic">methicillin-&#173;resistant S aureus (MRSA),</span> previously recognized as a cause of severe nosocomial infections, is now increasingly encountered in the community setting as well.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Community-&#173;acquired (CA)-&#173;MRSA infections tend to pre&#173;sent as a fluctuant abscess with surrounding cellulitis. Eyebrow abscesses have a particularly high rate of &#173;CA-&#173;MRSA–&#173;positive cultures. The pain associated with the lesion is often out of proportion to its appearance. Classically, CA-&#173;MRSA has been susceptible to a wider range of antibiotics (including TMP-&#173;SMX, rifampin, or clindamycin), compared with susceptibility of hospital-&#173;associated (HA)-&#173;MRSA. Over the past de&#173;cade, however, antibiotic-&#173;resistant CA-&#173;MRSA strains have migrated into the health care setting, and the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic differences and outcomes between CA-&#173;MRSA and HA-&#173;MRSA infections have increasingly overlapped. Both types of MRSA may result in acute morbidity and long-&#173;term disability. MRSA has also been associated with necrotizing fasciitis, orbital cellulitis, endogenous endophthalmitis, panophthalmitis, and cavernous sinus thrombosis.</p>

			<p class="h3">Orbital cellulitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital cellulitis involves structures posterior to the orbital septum, and in the majority of cases it occurs as a secondary extension of acute or chronic bacterial sinusitis (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;4-2</span>). Clinical findings include fever, leukocytosis (75% of cases), erythema, proptosis, chemosis, ptosis, and restriction of and pain with ocular movement (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-2A, B</span>). Decreased vision, impaired color vision, restricted visual fields, and pupillary abnormalities suggest optic neuropathy that demands immediate investigation and aggressive management. Delay in treatment may result in blindness, cavernous sinus thrombosis, cranial neuropathy, meningitis, or death. Treatment may require a multidisciplinary approach.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Orbital findings indicate that imaging is needed to identify sinusitis, which may require treatment from an otolaryngologist. Antibiotic therapy in adults should provide broad-&#173;spectrum coverage &#173;because such infections usually involve multiple organisms that may include gram-&#173;positive cocci, such as <span class="italic">H influenzae</span> and <span class="italic">Moraxella catarrhalis,</span> and anaerobes. Although nasal decongestants promote drainage of the infected sinus, sinus surgery is often required, especially if orbital findings pro&#173;gress during IV antibiotic therapy. In contrast, orbital cellulitis in &#173;children is more often caused by a single gram-&#173;positive organism and is less likely to require surgical sinus drainage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Progressive proptosis, globe displacement, or lack of response to appropriate antibiotic therapy suggests abscess formation, which can be identified on orbital CT imaging with contrast. Abscesses usually localize in the subperiosteal space (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-2C, D</span>), adjacent to the infected sinus, but may extend through the periosteum into the orbital soft tissues. When initial medical treatment fails, further imaging may identify an abscess and determine an approach for surgical intervention.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, not all subperiosteal abscesses (SPAs) require surgical drainage. Isolated medial or inferior SPAs in &#173;children younger than 9&#160;years with under&#173;lying isolated ethmoid sinusitis, intact vision, and only moderate proptosis typically respond to medical therapy. Management may consist of careful observation <span class="italic">&#173;unless any of the following criteria are pre&#173;sent:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">patient aged 9&#160;years or older</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">presence of frontal sinusitis</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">nonmedial SPA location</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">large SPA</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">suspicion of anaerobic infection (eg, presence of gas in abscess on CT)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">recurrence of SPA &#173;after prior drainage</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">evidence of chronic sinusitis (eg, nasal polyps)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">acute optic nerve or ret&#173;i&#173;nal compromise</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">infection of dental origin (anaerobic infection more likely)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with &#173;these criteria or with infections refractory to medical therapy, surgical drainage coupled with appropriate antibiotic therapy typically leads to clinical improvement within 24–48 hours. Sinusitis may improve with concomitant sinus surgery. The refractory nature of orbital abscesses in adolescents and adults may relate to the frequent involvement of multiple and drug-&#173;resistant pathogens, particularly anaerobic organisms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment with corticosteroids may speed resolution of inflammation and decrease the length of hospital admission, although the timing and dose remain controversial. Their use should be balanced by the risk of masking infection progression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because orbital cellulitis and abscesses respond to therapy in most patients, orbital infections rarely spread posteriorly to the cavernous sinus. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is often heralded by the rapid progression of proptosis, the development of ipsilateral ophthalmoplegia, and the onset of anesthesia in both the first and second divisions of the trigeminal nerve. In rare instances, contralateral ophthalmoplegia, meningitis, or frank brain abscess may develop. Lumbar puncture may reveal acute inflammatory cells and the causative organism on stain and culture. Contrast-&#173;enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirms the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Orbital cellulitis caused by MRSA may occur without antecedent respiratory illness or trauma and without adjacent paranasal sinus disease on imaging. MRSA-&#173;caused orbital cellulitis may require surgical intervention more often than typical orbital cellulitis, and it may also lead to significant decrease in visual acuity more often, especially in cases in which referral for surgical intervention has been delayed. &#173;Because of the potentially aggressive nature of this pathogen, successful management demands a high degree of clinical suspicion and prompt medical and surgical intervention. In addition, consultation with specialists in infectious diseases may be warranted.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Orbital cellulitis following blowout fractures generally occurs in patients with under&#173;lying sinus disease or a medial wall fracture. Prophylactic antibiotics can be considered in &#173;these cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Odontogenic infections may spread through the sinuses to cause orbital cellulitis. &#173;These infections account for 2%–5% of all orbital cellulitis cases and can arise from any tooth, although most develop from maxillary premolar teeth. &#173;These infections are typically polymicrobial, often consisting of gram-&#173;positive aerobes and anaerobes.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Necrotizing Fasciitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe, potentially vision-&#173;threatening or life-&#173;threatening bacterial infection involving the subcutaneous soft tissues, particularly the superficial and deep fasciae. A variety of organisms may cause this disorder, including aerobic and anaerobic, gram-&#173;positive and gram-&#173;negative bacteria, but the organism most commonly responsible is group A <span class="greek">β</span>-&#173;hemolytic streptococcus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This infection develops rapidly and requires immediate attention &#173;because it is potentially fatal. Although most patients are immunocompromised, it may occur in immunocompetent patients as well. The initial clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion is similar to that of orbital or preseptal cellulitis, with swelling, erythema, and pain, but it may be accompanied by a shocklike syndrome. &#173;Because necrotizing fasciitis tends to track along avascular tissue planes, an early sign may be anesthesia over the affected area caused by involvement of deep cutaneous nerves. In addition, reports of disproportionate pain may suggest the presence of necrotizing fasciitis, as do skin color changes that pro&#173;gress from &#173;rose to blue-&#173;gray, with bullae formation and frank cutaneous necrosis. Usually, the course is rapid, and the patient requires treatment in an intensive care unit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment includes early surgical debridement along with IV antibiotics (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-3</span>). If the involved pathogen is unknown, broad-&#173;spectrum coverage for gram-&#173;positive and gram-&#173;negative as well as anaerobic organisms is indicated. Clindamycin is effective in treating infections due to most causative organisms and acts against the toxins produced by group A streptococcus. To limit the inflammatory damage associated with the toxins, adjunctive corticosteroid therapy &#173;after the start of antibiotic therapy has been advocated. Some cases of necrotizing fasciitis can be cautiously followed with systemic antibiotic therapy and with &#173;little or no debridement, including cases that are &#173;limited to the eyelids, such &#173;those with clearly defined margins, and in which the patient shows no signs of toxic shock.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients may experience rapid deterioration, culminating in hypotension, renal failure, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Although clinical series from all body sites report up to a 30% mortality rate, usually due to toxic shock syndrome, this occurs less commonly in patients who have infection in the periocular region.</p>

			<p class="h2">Mycobacterial Infection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although it most commonly occurs in endemic areas of the developing world, tuber&#173;culosis may occur in the developed world as well, most often in individuals with HIV infection or in association with inner-&#173;city poverty. Orbital tuberculosis usually results &#173;after hematogenous spread from an often-&#173;subclinical pulmonary focus, but it may also arise from adjacent tuberculous sinusitis. Patients may pre&#173;sent with proptosis, motility dysfunction, bone destruction, and chronic draining fistulas. Most orbital cases are unilateral and occur in &#173;children, in whom the infection may masquerade as an orbital malignancy. Pathologic specimens may not reveal acid-&#173;fast bacilli, but usually show caseating necrosis, epithelioid cells, and Langerhans &#173;giant cells. Skin testing and fine-&#173;needle aspiration biopsy with culture performed early in the course of the disease may help establish the diagnosis. Antituberculous therapy is usually curative.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nontuberculous (aty&#173;pi&#173;cal) mycobacteria may also infect the periocular tissues. Predisposing &#173;factors include immunosuppression, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, trauma, and a history of recent periocular surgery. Postoperative infections occur most commonly &#173;after lacrimal surgery but can occur &#173;after blepharoplasty as well (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-4</span>). The causative organisms, which are identified in less than one-&#173;third of reported cases, are typically <span class="italic">My</span><span class="italic">cobacterium chelonae</span> or <span class="italic">Mycobacterium fortuitum.</span> Treatment consists of periocular debridement and systemic antituberculous antibiotics.</p>

			<p class="h2">Zygomycosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Zygomycosis</span> (also known as <span class="italic">phycomycosis</span> or <span class="italic">mucormycosis</span>) is the most common and the most virulent fungal disease involving the orbit. The specific fungal genus involved is usually <span class="italic">Mucor</span> or <span class="italic">Rhizopus.</span> &#173;These fungi, belonging to the class Zygomycetes, almost always extend into the orbit from an adjacent sinus or the nasal cavity. The fungi invade blood vessel walls, producing thrombosing vasculitis. The resultant tissue necrosis promotes further fungal invasion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients commonly pre&#173;sent with proptosis and an orbital apex syndrome (internal and external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, decreased corneal sensation, and decreased vision). Ascending infection may result in cavernous sinus thrombosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-5</span>). Because of the thrombosing vasculitis, the infection may not produce significant orbital inflammation and an unusually white and quiet eye should prompt concern for orbital ischemia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Predisposing &#173;factors include systemic disease with associated metabolic acidosis, diabetes mellitus, malignancies, and treatment with antimetabolites or ste&#173;roids. Biopsy of the necrotic-&#173;appearing tissues in the nasopharynx, involved sinus, or orbit confirms the diagnosis and shows nonseptate, large branching hyphae that stain with hematoxylin-&#173;eosin, unlike most fungi (see the discussion of zygomycosis in BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment should include a multidisciplinary team to address any under&#173;lying predisposing disease, perform wide surgical debridement, and administer antifungal therapy. Diabetic ketoacidosis, in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, requires prompt correction; this condition produces more &#173;free serum iron, thought to be central for fungal pathogenesis. Antifungal therapy may consist of IV or liposomal amphotericin B; posaconazole or voriconazole may be used in patients who cannot tolerate the adverse effects of amphotericin. In addition, retrobulbar injection of amphotericin B may be considered. Adjunctive treatments include hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Despite aggressive surgical debridement, including exenteration, the prognosis for survival remains poor and often depends on &#173;whether the under&#173;lying systemic predisposing disease is immediately treatable.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Aspergillosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fungi in the <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> genus can affect the orbit in several distinct clinical entities. <span class="italic">Inva</span><span class="italic">sive aspergillosis</span> is a fungal disease characterized by fulminant sinus infection with secondary orbital invasion. Patients pre&#173;sent with severe periorbital pain, decreased vision, and proptosis. Diagnosis is confirmed by 1 or more biopsies. Grocott-&#173;Gomori methenamine–&#173;silver nitrate stain shows septate branching hyphae of uniform width (see the discussion of aspergillosis in BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>). Therapy consists of aggressive surgical excision of all infected tissues and administration of antifungal agents, including polyenes (amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B), azoles (eg, itraconazole, voriconazole), echinocandins (caspofungin), and pyrimidine analogues (flucytosine), or a combination thereof.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Chronic necrotizing aspergillosis</span> is an indolent infection resulting in slow destruction of the sinuses and adjacent structures. Although the prognosis is much better than that for acute fulminant disease, intraorbital and intracranial extension can still occur and result in significant morbidity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chronic, localized noninvasive aspergillosis also involves the sinuses and occurs in immunocompetent patients who may not have a history of atopic disease. Often, &#173;there is a history of chronic sinusitis, and the proliferation of fungal organisms results in a tightly packed fungus ball. This type of aspergillosis is characterized by a lack of &#173;either inflammation or bone erosion.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Allergic aspergillosis sinusitis</span> occurs in immunocompetent patients with nasal polyposis and chronic sinusitis. Patients may have peripheral eosinophilia; elevated total immunoglobulin E (IgE), fungus-&#173;specific IgE, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels; or positive skin test results for fungal antigens. CT imaging reveals mottled areas of increased attenuation on nonenhanced images, corresponding to thick allergic mucin within the sinus. Bone erosion and remodeling, while often pre&#173;sent, do not signify tissue invasion. MRI may be more specific, showing signal void areas on T2-&#173;weighted scans. Sinus biopsy reveals thick, peanut butter–&#173;like or green mucus, with histologic examination showing numerous &#173;eosinophils, eosinophil degradation products, and extramucosal fungal hyphae. Treatment consists of endoscopic sinus debridement as well as systemic and topical corticosteroids. Up to 17% of patients with allergic fungal sinusitis initially pre&#173;sent with orbital signs.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Thyroid Eye Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Thyroid eye disease (TED; also known as <span class="italic">Graves ophthalmopathy, thyroid-&#173;associated orbitopathy,</span> and other terms) represents an autoimmune inflammatory disorder with characteristic clinical signs (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 4-7, 4-8, 4-9, 4-10</span>). Originally described as part of the triad of Graves disease (orbital signs, hyperthyroidism, and pretibial myxedema), TED most often occurs in individuals with Graves hyperthyroidism. However, TED may also occur with Hashimoto thyroiditis (immune-&#173;induced hypothyroidism) or in the absence of thyroid dysfunction. The course of the eye disease does not necessarily parallel the activity of the thyroid gland or the treatment of thyroid abnormalities.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See <span class="xref-sidebar">Key Points 4-1</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diagnosis of TED is made when 2 of the following 3 signs are pre&#173;sent:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;Concurrent or recently treated immune-&#173;related thyroid dysfunction:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list-first">a.&#9;Graves hyperthyroidism</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list-mid">b.&#9;Hashimoto thyroiditis</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list-last">c.&#9;Presence of circulating thyroid antibodies without a coexisting dysthyroid state (partial consideration given): thyroid-&#173;stimulating hormone–&#173;receptor (TSH-&#173;R) antibodies, thyroid-&#173;binding inhibitory immunoglobulins, thyroid-&#173;stimulating immunoglobulins, antimicrosomal antibodies</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;Typical ocular signs:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list-first">a.&#9;Chemosis and/or caruncular edema (see Fig 4-7)</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list-mid">b.&#9;Restrictive strabismus in a typical pattern (see Fig 4-8)</p>

			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list-mid">e.&#9;Compressive optic neuropathy</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list-last">f.&#9;Fluctuating eyelid edema and/or erythema</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">3.&#9;Radiographic evidence of TED: unilateral or bilateral fusiform enlargement any of the rectus muscles and/or the levator muscle complex (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 4-11, 4-12</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Serologic testing, using serum thyroid-&#173;stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>), and &#173;free thyroxine (T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span>) levels, is well established in the diagnosis of thyroid disease. However, the usefulness of &#173;these tests in monitoring TED treatment and progression is unclear, &#173;because the systemic disease and the eye disease are discordant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tests of autoimmune function may be helpful in evaluating disease activity and severity. TSH-&#173;R antibody testing can be performed by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing all immunoglobulins targeting the TSH-&#173;R (eg, the thyrotropin-&#173;binding inhibitory immunoglobulin [TBII] test) or by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing only the stimulating antibodies (eg, the thyroid-&#173;stimulating immunoglobulin [TSI] assay).</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;These tests may help identify the cause of the thyroid disease and may help identify patients at high risk for TED; however, results should be interpreted with caution &#173;because the diagnosis of TED is based mainly on clinical findings. Thyroid peroxidase antibody testing has replaced antimicrosomal antibody testing; however, the presence of this anti&#173;body does not correlate with TED activity or severity or TSI levels. Similarly, thyroglobulin antibody levels do not correlate with TED. Insulin-&#173;like growth &#173;factor I (IGF-&#173;I) antibody levels may represent a &#173;future area of serologic testing for TED; however, no current recommendations exist.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients presenting with only orbital signs require observation for other orbital diseases or the development of a dysthyroid state.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Pathogenesis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital fibroblasts, through the expression of characteristic surface receptors, gangliosides, and proinflammatory genes, play an active role in modulating the inflammatory pro&#173;cess. Unlike fibroblasts from other body sites, orbital fibroblasts express CD40 receptors, which are generally found on B cells. When engaged by T-&#173;cell–&#173;bound CD154, several fibroblast proinflammatory cytokines are upregulated, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), as well as prostaglandin E2, increasing synthesis of hyaluronan and glycosaminoglycan (GAG). This upregulation of orbital fibroblast GAG synthesis represents an essential aspect of the pathology of TED, and it occurs at a rate 100 times that of abdominal fibroblasts from the same patient. Therapeutic levels of corticosteroids dampen the upregulation cascade.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Orbital fibroblasts, which are embryologically derived from the neural crest lineage, possess developmental plasticity. A subpopulation of orbital fibroblasts appears capable of undergoing adipocyte differentiation, contributing to the expansion of orbital fat that predominates in some patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A circulating immunoglobulin that recognizes and activates the insulin-&#173;like growth &#173;factor I receptor (IGF-&#173;IR) expressed on the surface of orbital fibroblasts of individuals with Graves disease may stimulate orbital fibroblasts to secrete GAGs, cytokines, and chemoattractants. &#173;These latter signaling families may contribute to orbital inflammation and congestion.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Epidemiology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A 1996 epidemiologic study of white patients with TED in the United States determined that the overall age-&#173;adjusted incidence per 100,000 population per year was 16 cases for &#173;women compared with 3 cases for men. The peak incidences occurred in the age groups 40–44&#160;years and 60–64&#160;years in &#173;women and 45–49&#160;years and 65–69&#160;years in men. Development of TED is up to 7 times as likely for smokers when compared to nonsmokers.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Among patients with TED, about 90% have Graves hyperthyroidism, 6% are euthyroid, 3% have Hashimoto thyroiditis, and 1% have primary hypothyroidism. A close temporal relationship exists between the development of hyperthyroidism and the development of TED: in about 20% of patients, the diagnoses are made at the same time, and in about 60% of patients, the eye disease occurs within 1 year of onset of the thyroid disease. For patients who have no history of abnormal thyroid function or regulation at the time TED is diagnosed, the risk for development of thyroid disease is about 25% within 1 year and 50% within 5&#160;years. Although hyperthyroidism is pre&#173;sent or &#173;will develop in most patients with TED, only about 30% of patients with autoimmune hyperthyroidism &#173;will develop TED.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pretibial myxedema accompanies TED in about 4% of patients. Acropachy (soft-&#173;tissue swelling and periosteal changes affecting the distal extremities, principally fin&#173;gers and toes) accompanies TED in about 1% of patients. Both are associated with a poor prognosis for the orbitopathy. Myasthenia gravis occurs in fewer than 1% of patients and should be considered when ptosis accompanies TED.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most frequent presenting ocular symptoms and signs of TED are a dull, deep orbital pain or discomfort (30% of patients), lid lag with downgaze (unilateral or bilateral, 50%; see Fig 4-10), and upper eyelid retraction (unilateral or bilateral, 75%). Symptomatic dysthyroid optic neuropathy is pre&#173;sent in less than 2% of eyes at the time of diagnosis of TED.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Upper eyelid retraction occurs in more than 90% of patients during their clinical course (see Fig 4-9); exophthalmos (unilateral or bilateral) in 60%; restrictive extraocular myopathy in 40%; and optic neuropathy (unilateral or bilateral) in 5%. Only 5% of patients develop the complete constellation of &#173;these 4 classic findings and hyperthyroidism. Some degree of diplopia is reported by about 17% of patients, lacrimation or photophobia by 15%–20% of patients, and blurred vision by 7% of patients.</p>

			<p class="h3">Treatment and prognosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">TED is a self-&#173;limiting disease that on average lasts 1 year in nonsmokers and between 2 and 3&#160;years in smokers. &#173;After the active disease plateaus, a quiescent “burnt-&#173;out” phase that follows Rundle’s curve ensues (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-13</span>). Reactivation of inflammation occurs in 5%–10% of patients over their lifetime.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although several clinical scoring systems to guide TED evaluation and treatment exist, including NO SPECS, Clinical Activity Score (CAS), and VISA, no system prevails. The CAS and VISA systems each assign points for vari&#173;ous findings; the CAS adds extra par&#173;ameters for follow-up visits and the VISA uses the same scale for both initial and follow-up visits. Treatment of patients with TED follows a stepwise and graded approach based on symptoms, clinical examination, and ancillary testing (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Tables&#160;4-3</span>, <span class="xref-table">4-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most patients with TED in the active phase require only smoking cessation and supportive care, including use of topical ocular lubricants. The following may also be helpful:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">topical cyclosporine, which may reduce ocular surface irritation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">a reduced-&#173;salt diet and sleeping with the head of the bed elevated, which may limit orbital edema</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">wearing wraparound sunglasses, which may relieve exposure and dry eye symptoms</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">temporary prism glasses, which may help maintain binocular fusion</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition, selenium supplementation may improve the course of disease, especially in patients heralding from selenium-&#173;deficient regions. Neurotoxins can temporarily improve upper eyelid retraction by weakening the eyelid elevators. Neurotoxins can also be used to treat restrictive strabismus by weakening affected extraocular muscle(s).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Severe orbital inflammation may mandate early intervention to improve corneal exposure, globe subluxation, or optic neuropathy. Therapies generally attempt to decrease orbital congestion and inflammation (eg, glucocorticoids, biologics, radiotherapy), mechanically protect the cornea (eg, tarsorrhaphy), expand the orbital bony volume (eg, bony orbital decompression), or reduce orbital soft tissue volume (eg, fatty orbital decompression).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Establishing the euthyroid state represents a mainstay of therapy. Hyperthyroidism is most commonly treated with antithyroid drugs and sometimes with radioactive iodine (RAI). In some patients, RAI treatment may worsen TED, presumably &#173;because the TSH-&#173;R antigen release incites an enhanced immune response. In addition, hypothyroidism occurring &#173;after RAI treatment may exacerbate TED via stimulation of TSH-&#173;R. Exacerbation of TED &#173;after RAI treatment may occur more commonly in hyperthyroid patients with severe, active TED, &#173;those with elevated T<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">3</span> levels, and smokers. Oral glucocorticoid treatment tapered over 3 months may limit TED progression in patients with risk &#173;factors such as &#173;these, but it is not indicated for patients without preexisting TED and without risk &#173;factors. Another strategy, termed <span class="italic">block-&#173;and-&#173;replace therapy</span> (eg, with iodine 131, methimazole, and thyroxine) reduces exacerbation of eye findings by limiting posttreatment TSH spikes. A third strategy, usually reserved for patients whose disease is refractory to RAI or &#173;those with severe TED, involves thyroidectomy, which creates hypothyroidism without extended antigen release.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with active TED featuring compressive optic neuropathy or other significant activity based on scoring systems (eg, VISA, CAS) may benefit from IV glucocorticoid treatment. Typical regimens vary from 500&#160;mg to 1&#160;g methylprednisolone weekly for 6–12 weeks, with a maximum dose of approximately 6&#160;g in most cases and up to 8&#160;g in severe cases. Hepatic function should be checked before administration and monitored throughout treatment due to potentially fatal hepatotoxicity. For oral glucocorticoids, which are now less commonly used than they &#173;were in the past, the usual starting dose is 1&#160;mg/kg prednisone for 2–4 weeks &#173;until a clinical response is apparent. The dose is then reduced as rapidly as pos&#173;si&#173;ble, based on the clinical response of optic nerve function. Although effective, high-&#173;dose glucocorticoids are associated with an extensive list of potential systemic adverse effects, limiting their long-&#173;term use. Refractory cases of optic neuropathy and vision-&#173;threatening exposure keratopathy may require additional treatments, such as orbital radiotherapy or decompressive surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some reports suggest that treatment with fractionated orbital radiotherapy improves compressive optic neuropathy and other signs of TED in some patients, possibly by inducing terminal differentiation of fibroblasts and killing tissue-&#173;bound monocytes, which play an impor&#173;tant role in antigen pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion. Recent evidence has suggested it may provide a protective effect against the development of optic neuropathy. Given the biologic effects of radiation, it is likely more useful in the active phase of the disease. Although radiation has been used for de&#173;cades, a wealth of data exists to both support and refute its use, with and without the use of glucocorticoids, for many signs and symptoms of TED. Radiation therapy carries a rare risk of exacerbating diabetic retinopathy or other ischemic retinopathies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment with rituximab may affect the clinical course of TED by blocking the CD20 receptor on B lymphocytes; however, it does not appear to target the central mechanisms of the disease, and most clinicians currently use this only as a second-&#173;line therapy in select cases. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal IL-6 antibody, may reduce inflammatory signs and even TSI via an upstream effect on the inflammatory cycle. A variety of other anti-&#173;inflammatory, antimetabolite, and biologic agents have been employed with &#173;limited success.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In a recent clinical trial, teprotumumab, a &#173;human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of IGF-&#173;IR, reduced exophthalmos and the CAS in patients with active ophthalmopathy. Teprotumumab may specifically target the autoimmune pro&#173;cess under&#173;lying TED. This new therapeutic agent appears well tolerated; hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus represents the main adverse effect.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with active TED, orbital decompression treats optic neuropathy and severe exposure keratopathy that is refractory to medical therapy. In the postinflammatory phase of the condition, the first stage of surgical rehabilitation is decompression to address disfiguring or symptomatic proptosis. Preoperative CT imaging details the relative contributions of extraocular muscle enlargement and fat expansion to the proptosis (see &#173;<span class="xref-figure-local">Figs </span><span class="xref-figure-local">4-11</span>, <span class="xref-figure-local">4-12</span>). Patients with more enlargement of the orbital fat compartment (type I orbitopathy) may benefit from more fatty decompression, whereas patients with more extraocular muscle enlargement (type II orbitopathy) may benefit from more bony decompression. Fat and bone removal can be combined, graded, and tailored to achieve dif&#173;fer&#173;ent amounts of proptosis reduction while minimizing adverse effects, such as diplopia, hypoglobus, and sinusitis. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7</span> for further discussion of orbital decompression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because decompression may produce or worsen diplopia, it should precede strabismus surgery, which may help restore single vision in patients with intractable diplopia in primary gaze or in the reading position. Prisms represent another option for patients with relatively comitant strabismus or for patients with a small deviation &#173;after strabismus surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgery to recess the rectus muscles can change eyelid position, so strabismus surgery typically precedes eyelid repositioning surgery. Levator and/or M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller muscle recession improves upper eyelid retraction to decrease corneal exposure and help improve appearance. The lower eyelids can be repositioned as well, typically by recessing the eyelid retractors, with or without a spacer graft or during a midface-lift. Fi&#173;nally, the last stage of surgery includes redraping of the eyelid skin and subcutaneous tissues. &#173;These techniques often address redundant skin and fatty tissues in addition to concomitant and in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent periocular aging changes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Elective orbital decompression, strabismus surgery, and eyelid retraction repair are usually not considered &#173;until achieving a euthyroid state with stable ophthalmic signs for at least 6 to 9 months.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fortunately, treatment usually mitigates vision loss from optic neuropathy and prism glasses typically treat per&#173;sis&#173;tent diplopia. Subjectively, however, more than 50% of patients believe that their eyes look abnormal, and 38% of patients are dissatisfied with the appearance of their eyes. Thus, although significant long-&#173;term functional impairment from TED remains uncommon, the disease leaves lasting psychological and aesthetic sequelae.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Vasculitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vasculitides represent type III hypersensitivity reactions to circulating immune complexes leading to infiltration of vessel walls by inflammatory cells. Orbital involvement usually leads to significant morbidity and is typically associated with systemic vasculitis. The following discussion focuses mainly on the orbital manifestations of the vasculitides. See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;1</span>, <span class="italic">Update on General Medicine</span>; Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>; and Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">&#173;Giant cell arteritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although it is not typically thought of as an orbital disorder, &#173;giant cell arteritis (GCA; also called <span class="italic">temporal arteritis</span>) involves inflammation of the orbital vessels. The vasculitis affects the aorta, vertebral arteries, and branches of the external and internal carotid arteries; however, it typically spares the intracranial carotid artery branches, which lack an elastic lamina. Vision loss may occur from central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion or ischemic optic neuropathy, and diplopia may result from ischemic dysfunction of associated cranial nerves. Systemic manifestations include headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and constitutional symptoms.</p>

Tocilizumab, a monoclonal interleukin-6 receptor antibody, can induce and maintain remission with a shorter corticosteroid taper.

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">Granulomatosis with polyangiitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis), is a multisystem disease characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis of small-&#173; to medium-&#173;sized vessels. Although the disease often affects the respiratory and renal systems, it can affect any body site. Orbital involvement occurs in 45%–60% of patients with GPA and represents the most common ophthalmologic manifestation of the disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">GPA typically pre&#173;sents clinically as &#173;either a systemic and generalized disease or in a more &#173;limited form. The generalized form may produce sinusitis with or without bone erosion, tracheobronchial necrotic and stenotic lesions, cavitary lung lesions, and glomerulonephritis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-14</span>). It is unclear &#173;whether the &#173;limited form of the disease represents a distinct clinical entity or is just a subtype of the general form. &#173;Either form can extend from the surrounding sinuses to involve the orbit and nasolacrimal drainage system, but the &#173;limited form &#173;causes approximately two-&#173;thirds of orbital GPA cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologic examination, especially in cases of isolated orbital involvement, may not always show the classic triad of vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation (with or without &#173;giant cells), and tissue necrosis. Often, only 1 or 2 of &#173;these findings are pre&#173;sent on extrapulmonary biopsies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although their exact pathogenic role remains unclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCAs) are strongly associated with certain vasculitides, including GPA. Testing for ANCAs distinguishes 2 types of immunofluorescence patterns.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diffuse granular fluorescence within the cytoplasm (c-&#173;ANCA) is highly specific for GPA. This pattern is caused by autoantibodies directed against proteinase-3, which can then be mea&#173;sured by enzyme-&#173;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fluorescence surrounding the nucleus (p-&#173;ANCA) is an artifact of ethanol fixation and can be caused by autoantibodies against many dif&#173;fer&#173;ent target antigens. This finding is therefore nonspecific and needs to be confirmed by ELISA for ANCA reacting with myeloperoxidase (MPO-&#173;ANCA). MPO-&#173;ANCA testing has moderate specificity for small-&#173;vessel vasculitis but may return a positive result in patients with nonvasculitic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, or systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although highly specific for GPA, c-&#173;ANCA tests possess less sensitivity, especially in cases of isolated sino-&#173;orbital GPA and in inactive disease. Unlike c-&#173;ANCA–&#173;positive disease, p-&#173;ANCA–&#173;positive disease rarely affects the eye and orbit. Absolute levels of ANCA do not define disease severity or activity, and the use of titers to monitor for response to therapy, remission, and relapse remains controversial.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of GPA relies on remission-&#173;induction therapy, often using cytotoxic agents (eg, cyclophosphamide) and corticosteroids, followed by remission-&#173;maintenance therapy, often using methotrexate, azathioprine, and corticosteroids. Long-&#173;term treatment with TMP-&#173;SMX appears to suppress disease activity in some patients, and rituximab may help induce remission, although relapses are common regardless of treatment. Patients require care coordination from a rheumatologist, &#173;because both GPA and its treatment can produce life-&#173;threatening effects.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a multisystem disease in which small-&#173; and medium-&#173;sized arteries are affected by inflammation characterized by the presence of neutrophils and eosinophils, with necrosis of the muscularis layer. Although PAN may affect multiple organ systems, the disease rarely produces orbital inflammation. Ophthalmic manifestations more commonly result from ret&#173;i&#173;nal and choroidal infarction.</p>
			<p class="h2">Sarcoidosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sarcoidosis, which is characterized by collections of noncaseating granuloma, can affect any organ, most commonly the lungs. It may also affect the orbit. In Amer&#173;i&#173;ca, the disease occurs 3 to 4 times as frequently in individuals of African descent as in &#173;those of Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean or Asian descent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Within the orbit, the disease most frequently affects lacrimal gland, typically bilaterally. Gallium scanning, although nonspecific, shows lacrimal gland involvement in 80% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis, although only 7% of patients demonstrate clinically detectable lacrimal gland enlargement. Subconjunctival nodules (Fig 4-15A, B) and other orbital soft tissues, including the extraocular muscles and optic nerve, are involved only in rare cases. Infrequently, &#173;there is sinus involvement, with associated lytic bone lesions invading into the adjacent orbit. The disease may also affect the nasolacrimal drainage system, producing nasolacrimal duct obstruction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chest radiography, CT, or gallium scans may detect hilar adenopathy or pulmonary infiltrates (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-15C, D</span>). Serologic testing may show elevated levels of angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme (ACE), lysozyme, and calcium. ACE is produced by the epithelioid cells and macrophages found in sarcoid granulomas, so the ACE level reflects the mass of granulomas in the body and the severity of sarcoidosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Regardless of serologic and imaging findings, when pos&#173;si&#173;ble, it may be best to confirm the diagnosis with tissue biopsy. Biopsy of an affected lacrimal gland or of a suspicious conjunctival lesion may establish the diagnosis; however, random conjunctival biopsies have a low yield. Bronchoscopy with bronchial washing and biopsy may confirm pulmonary involvement. Histologic examination reveals noncaseating collections of epithelioid histiocytes in a granulomatous pattern, with mononuclear cells often appearing at the periphery of the granuloma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Isolated orbital lesions can occur without associated systemic disease; this condition is called orbital sarcoidosis. Interestingly, patients with &#173;either isolated or systemic sarcoidosis involving the orbit rarely develop intraocular involvement and vice versa.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> and Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation,</span> for more extensive discussion and clinical photo&#173;graphs of sarcoidosis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Immunoglobulin G4–&#173;Related Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Immunoglobulin G4–&#173;related disease (IgG4-&#173;RD) is a fibroinflammatory disorder that may affect 1 or more organs (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-16</span>). Orbital disease may occur alone or with systemic disease, &#173;either synchronously or metachronously. Within the orbit, the disease most commonly affects the lacrimal gland, and orbital involvement occurs in common patterns, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">enlargement of the orbital nerves (typically the infraorbital), extraocular muscles, and lacrimal gland, often with sinusitis, peripheral eosinophilia, and systemic involvement</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">sclerosing dacryoadenitis (unilateral or bilateral)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">sclerosing orbital inflammation without dacryoadenitis</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Histologic examination shows lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates with large numbers of &#173;immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-&#173;positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis, and eosinophil infiltration. A consensus statement set the minimum number of IgG4-&#173;positive plasma cells for the lacrimal gland at greater than 100 per high-&#173;power field; however, many published series report smaller numbers of cells. In most cases, the ratio of IgG4-&#173;to-&#173;IgG plasma cells is greater than 40%. Given the spectrum of histologic findings, the diagnosis requires integrating clinical, imaging, and histopathologic criteria.</p>
			<p class="body-text">About half of patients with the orbital disease &#173;will also have disease in other organs. Rheumatological evaluation often includes examination for salivary gland, lymph node, lung, liver, and retroperitoneal involvement using vari&#173;ous imaging studies, including CT, MRI, and CT-&#173;PET (positron emission tomography) scanning. Serologic testing may show peripheral eosinophilia and elevated IgG4 levels.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment includes the use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants and biologic agents, including rituximab. Another monoclonal antibody that targets CD19 shows promise to treat this condition as well.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Immunoglobulin G4–&#173;related disease comprises a significant proportion of what was previously labeled nonspecific orbital inflammation; thus, biopsy of orbital inflammatory lesions should routinely include an examination for features of IgG4-&#173;RD. With greater understanding of inflammatory disease, other conditions previously labeled nonspecific orbital inflammation may be elucidated.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Nonspecific Orbital Inflammation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diagnosis of nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI, also known as idiopathic orbital inflammation) remains a diagnosis of exclusion, made only &#173;after all specific &#173;causes of inflammation have been eliminated<span class="italic">.</span> The condition is characterized by a polymorphous lymphoid infiltrate with varying degrees of fibrosis, without a known local or systemic cause.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although controversial, the pathogenesis of NSOI appears to be immune-&#173;mediated due to its association with systemic immunologic disorders, including Crohn disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, myasthenia gravis, and ankylosing spondylitis. In addition, NSOI typically responds rapidly to treatment with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents, indicating a cell-&#173;mediated component.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The symptoms and clinical findings in NSOI vary, depending on the degree and anatomical location of the inflammation. In order of frequency, NSOI tends to occur in the 5 following orbital locations or patterns:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">extraocular muscles <span class="bullet-list_italic">(myositis)</span></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">lacrimal gland <span class="bullet-list_italic">(dacryoadenitis)</span></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">anterior orbit (eg, <span class="bullet-list_italic">scleritis</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">orbital apex</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">throughout the orbit (as diffuse inflammation)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Although it is usually &#173;limited to the orbit, NSOI may also extend into the adjacent sinuses or intracranial space. Deep, boring pain occurs in many cases; pain associated with ocular movement suggests myositis. Symptoms of vision impairment may occur with involvement of the optic nerve or posterior sclera. Signs include extraocular muscle restriction, proptosis, conjunctival inflammation, chemosis, and erythema and edema of the eyelid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-17</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Imaging studies such as CT, MRI, and ultrasonography reveal enlargement of affected tissues and may show other characteristic findings. Up to 50% of cases show thickening of the extraocular muscle tendon insertions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-18</span>), in contrast with TED, which typically spares the muscle insertions. Involvement of the retrobulbar fat pad may produce fat stranding, and tendonitis may produce contrast enhancement of the sclera. B-&#173;scan ultrasonography often shows an acoustically hollow area that corresponds to an edematous Tenon capsule (T-&#173;sign).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A prompt initial response to high-&#173;dose (1&#160;mg/kg oral prednisone or equivalent) systemic corticosteroids supports the diagnosis; this response is observed in most myositic cases and in about 80% of nonmyositic cases. However, inflammation associated with other orbital pro&#173;cesses (eg, metastases, lymphoma, ruptured dermoid cysts, infections) may also improve with systemic corticosteroid administration. In 1 study, 50% of biopsied inflammatory lacrimal gland lesions &#173;were associated with systemic disease, including GPA, sclerosing inflammation, Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren syndrome, sarcoidal reactions, and autoimmune disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Given the low morbidity associated with biopsy, the possibility of other orbital pro&#173;cesses responding to treatment with corticosteroids, and the high incidence of systemic disease involving the lacrimal gland, many experts recommend diagnostic biopsy of all nonmyositic lesions not attached to the optic nerve. Surgical debulking of idiopathic dacryoadenitis during the biopsy procedure may carry a therapeutic as well as a diagnostic benefit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In cases of myositis, lesions attached to the optic nerve and lesions involving the orbital apex may produce characteristic clinical and radiographic findings to strongly support the presumed diagnosis, and the risk associated with biopsy may outweigh the risk of a missed diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Not all patients with NSOI pre&#173;sent with the classic signs and symptoms; some patients pre&#173;sent with aty&#173;pi&#173;cal pain, &#173;limited inflammatory signs, or a fibrotic variant called <span class="italic">sclerosing NSOI.</span> Simultaneous bilateral orbital inflammation in adults suggests the possibility of systemic vasculitis. Any diagnostic uncertainty mandates a thorough systemic evaluation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In &#173;children with NSOI, approximately one-&#173;third of cases pre&#173;sent bilaterally and approximately one-&#173;half pre&#173;sent with systemic signs, such as headache, fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, and lethargy. Uveitis, elevated ESR levels, and eosinophilia are also more common in &#173;children with NSOI. Pediatric NSOI is not generally associated with systemic disorders.</p>
			<p class="body-text">On histologic examination, NSOI is characterized by a pleomorphic cellular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils with variable degrees of reactive fibrosis. The sclerosing subtype of NSOI demonstrates a predominance of fibrosis with sparse cellular inflammation. Hypercellular lymphoid proliferations represent clinical and histologic entities that are dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from NSOI.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-7">Mombaerts I, Bilyk JR, Rose GE, et&#160;al; Expert Panel of the Orbital Society. Consensus on diagnostic criteria of idiopathic orbital inflammation using a modified Delphi approach. <span class="reference--journal-_italic">JAMA Ophthalmol.</span> 2017;135(7):769–776.</p>
			<p class="h3">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As previously mentioned, initial therapy for NSOI consists of systemic corticosteroids, with a typical initial daily adult dosage of 1&#160;mg/kg prednisone. Acute cases generally respond rapidly, with abrupt resolution of pain. Ste&#173;roid taper begins &#173;after maximal clinical response; it should proceed more slowly below about 40&#160;mg/day and even slower below 20&#160;mg/day, based on the clinical response. Rapid reduction of systemic ste&#173;roids may allow for recurrence. Some investigators believe that pulse-&#173;dosed IV dexamethasone followed by oral prednisone may produce clinical improvement when oral prednisone alone fails to control the inflammation. Sclerosing NSOI responds poorly to ste&#173;roids and to low-&#173;dose fractionated radiotherapy; it typically requires more aggressive immunosuppression with agents such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, or cyclophosphamide.</p>

			<p class="sidebar-h2 ParaOverride-17"><span class="sidebar-h2 CharOverride-1">Thyroid eye disease (TED)</span> The following list highlights the essential points for the ophthalmologist to remember about  TED.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-first">Eyelid retraction is the most common clinical feature of  TED (and TED is the most common cause of eyelid retraction).</li>
				<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">TED is the most common cause of unilateral or bilateral proptosis.</li>
				<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">TED may be markedly asymmetric.</li>
				<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">TED is associated with hyperthyroidism in 90% of patients, but 6% of patients may be euthyroid.</li>
				<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">Severity of  TED usually does not parallel serum levels of triiodothyronine (T<span class="sidebar-bullet-list_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>) or &#173;free thyroxine (T<span class="sidebar-bullet-list_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span>).</li>
				<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">TED is up to 6 times as common in &#173;women as in men.</li>
				<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">Smoking is associated with increased risk and severity of  TED.</li>
				<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">Urgent care may be required for optic neuropathy or severe prop&#173;tosis with corneal decompensation.</li>
				<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">If surgery is needed, the usual order is orbital decompression, followed by strabismus surgery, followed by eyelid retraction repair (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7&#160;in this volume</span>).</li>
				<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">Radiotherapy may prevent optic neuropathy and may improve some aspects of  TED, but its role remains controversial.</li>
