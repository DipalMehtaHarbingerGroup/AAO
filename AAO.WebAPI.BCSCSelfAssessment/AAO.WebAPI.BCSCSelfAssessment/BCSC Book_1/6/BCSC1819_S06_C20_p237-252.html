			<p class="chapter-title">External Diseases of the Eye</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This chapter focuses on external diseases of the eye that are seen in the pediatric population. Many of the topics covered in this chapter are also discussed in BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">Ex</span><span class="italic">ternal Disease and Cornea.</span></p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Infectious Conjunctivitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt20_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Bacterial and viral infections are the most common &#173;causes of infectious conjunctivitis in &#173;children in developed countries. Presenting symptoms of infectious conjunctivitis commonly include burning, stinging, and foreign-&#173;body sensation; signs include conjunctival hyperemia, ocular discharge, and matting of the eyelids. Symptoms and signs may be pres&#173;ent unilaterally or bilaterally. The character of the discharge is diagnostically helpful and may be serous, mucopurulent, or purulent. Purulent discharge suggests a polymorphonuclear response to a bacterial infection, mucopurulent discharge suggests a viral or chlamydial infection, and a serous or watery discharge suggests a viral or allergic reaction. Membrane or pseudomembrane formation may occur in severe viral or bacterial conjunctivitis, Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome, ligneous conjunctivitis, and chemical burns. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;20-1</span> lists common &#173;causes of conjunctival hyperemia, or <span class="italic">red eye,</span> in infants and &#173;children.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Ophthalmia Neonatorum</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Ophthalmia neonatorum</span> refers to conjunctivitis occurring in the first month of life. This condition can be caused by bacterial, viral, or chemical agents. Widespread effective prophylaxis has diminished its occurrence to very low levels in industrialized countries, but ophthalmia neonatorum remains a significant cause of ocular infection, blindness, and even death in medically underserved areas around the world.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Epidemiology and etiology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Worldwide, the incidence of ophthalmia neonatorum is greater in areas with high rates of sexually transmitted disease and poor health care. The prevalence ranges from 0.1% in highly developed countries with effective prenatal and perinatal care to 10% in areas such as East Africa. &#173;Because a &#173;mother may have multiple sexually transmitted diseases, infants with one type of ophthalmia neonatorum should be screened for other such diseases. Public health authorities should be contacted to initiate evaluation and treatment of other maternal contacts in cases of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The causative organism usually infects the infant through direct contact during passage through the birth canal. Infection can ascend to the uterus, especially if &#173;there is prolonged rupture of membranes, so even with cesarean delivery, infants can be infected.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head CharOverride-1">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> Ophthalmia neonatorum caused by <span class="italic">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> typically pres&#173;ents in the first 3–4 days of life. Patients may pres&#173;ent with mild conjunctival hyperemia and ocular discharge. In severe cases, &#173;there is marked chemosis, copious discharge, and potentially rapid corneal ulceration and perforation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-1</span>). Systemic infection can cause sepsis, meningitis, and arthritis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Gram stain of the conjunctival exudate showing gram-&#173;negative intracellular diplococci allows a presumptive diagnosis of <span class="italic">N gonorrhoeae</span> infection; treatment should be started immediately. Ophthalmia neonatorum from <span class="italic">Neisseria meningitidis</span> has also been reported. Definitive diagnosis is based on culture of the conjunctival discharge. Treatment of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum includes systemic ceftriaxone and topical irrigation with saline. Topical antibiotics may also be indicated if &#173;there is corneal involvement.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head CharOverride-1">Chlamydia trachomatis</span> <span class="italic">Chlamydia trachomatis</span> is an obligate intracellular bacterium that can cause neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis. Onset of conjunctivitis usually occurs around 1 week of age, although it may be earlier, especially in cases with premature rupture of membranes. Eye infection is characterized by minimal to moderate filmy discharge, mild swelling of the eyelids, and hyperemia with a papillary reaction of the conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-</span><span class="xref-figure">2</span>). Severe cases may be accompanied by more copious discharge and pseudomembrane formation. Chlamydial infection in infants differs from that in adults in several ways: in infants, membrane formation may occur, the amount of mucopurulent discharge is greater, and &#173;there is no follicular response.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chlamydial infections can be diagnosed by culture of conjunctival scrapings, polymerase chain reaction, direct fluo&#173;rescent antibody tests, and enzyme immunoassays. Systemic treatment of neonatal chlamydial disease is indicated &#173;because of the risk of pneumonitis and otitis media. The treatment of choice is oral erythromycin, 50&#160;mg/kg per day in 4 divided doses for 14 days. Topical erythromycin ointment may be used in addition to but not as a replacement for oral therapy.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Herpes simplex virus</span> Infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) is usually secondary to HSV type 2 and typically pres&#173;ents &#173;later than infection with <span class="italic">N gonorrhoeae</span> or <span class="italic">C trachomatis,</span> frequently in the second week of life. See the discussion of congenital HSV infection in Chapter&#160;28.</p>
			<p class="h3">Chemical conjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chemical conjunctivitis refers to a mild, self-&#173;limited irritation and redness of the conjunctiva occurring in the first 24 hours &#173;after instillation of silver nitrate, a preparation used for ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis. This condition improves spontaneously by the second day of life.</p>
			<p class="h3">Ophthalmia neonatorum prophylaxis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Originally, 2% silver nitrate was used as prophylactic treatment of gonorrheal ophthalmia neonatorum. However, it is not effective against <span class="italic">C trachomatis</span> and has largely been supplanted by agents that are effective against both <span class="italic">N gonorrhoeae</span> and <span class="italic">C trachomatis,</span> such as erythromycin and tetracycline ointments and 2.5% povidone-&#173;iodine solution. Silver nitrate is still used in some parts of the world.</p>
			<p class="h2">Bacterial Conjunctivitis in &#173;Children and Adolescents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common &#173;causes of bacterial conjunctivitis in school-&#173;aged &#173;children are <span class="italic">Strepto</span><span class="italic">coc</span><span class="italic">cus pneumoniae, Haemophilus</span> species, <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus,</span> and <span class="italic">Moraxella.</span> The incidence of infection from <span class="italic">Haemophilus</span> has decreased &#173;because of widespread immunization, whereas the incidence of methicillin-&#173;resistant <span class="italic">S aureus</span> (MRSA) conjunctivitis has increased. More severe forms of bacterial conjunctivitis accompanied by copious discharge suggest infection with more virulent organisms, including <span class="italic">N gonorrhoeae</span> and <span class="italic">N </span><span class="italic">meningitidis.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnosis is by clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion. Culture to identify the offending agent is usually not necessary in mild cases but should be performed in severe cases. If the infection is untreated, symptoms are self-&#173;limited but may last up to 2 weeks. A broad-&#173;spectrum topical ophthalmic drop or ointment should shorten the course to a few days. Topical medi&#173;cations that are usually effective include polymyxin combinations, aminoglycosides, erythromycin, bacitracin, fluoroquinolones, and azithromycin. Fluoroquinolones may be considerably more expensive than other medi&#173;cations and may increase the risk of promoting drug-&#173;resistant organisms. Patients with <span class="italic">N meningitidis</span> conjunctivitis, and &#173;others exposed to &#173;these patients, require systemic treatment &#173;because of the high risk of meningitis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome (POS) manifests as unilateral granulomatous conjunctivitis associated with preauricular and submandibular lymphadenopathy that can be very marked (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-3</span>). MRSA conjunctivitis can have a similar pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion. <span class="italic">Bartonella hense</span><span class="italic">lae,</span> a pleomorphic gram-&#173;negative bacillus that is endemic in cats and &#173;causes cat-&#173;scratch disease, is the most common cause of POS. Other causative organisms include <span class="italic">Mycobac</span><span class="italic">terium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pseudotuberculo</span><span class="italic">sis, Treponema pallidum,</span> and <span class="italic">C trachomatis.</span> Cat-&#173;scratch disease is usually associated with a scratch from a kitten, but a cat bite or even touching the eye with a hand that has been licked by an infected kitten can cause the disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Serologic testing is an effective means of diagnosing POS. Presence of antibodies to <span class="italic">B </span><span class="italic">henselae,</span> detected by indirect fluo&#173;rescent antibody testing or enzyme immunoassay, can confirm a diagnosis of cat-&#173;scratch disease. Treatment can be supportive in mild cases of cat-&#173;scratch disease &#173;because the disease is self-&#173;limited. In more severe cases systemic treatment, usually with azithromycin, may be indicated. Appropriate systemic antibiotics are used to treat the other organisms that cause POS.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Chlamydial infections</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Two dif&#173;fer&#173;ent diseases can be caused by <span class="italic">C trachomatis</span> in &#173;children and adolescents: trachoma (serotypes A–&#173;C) and adult inclusion conjunctivitis (serotypes D–&#173;K).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Trachoma</span> Trachoma is the most common cause of preventable blindness in the world. This disease is uncommon in Eu&#173;rope and the United States, except in areas of the southern United States and on Native American reservations. It is caused by poor hygiene and inadequate sanitation and is spread from eye to eye or by flies or fomites. Clinical manifestations include acute purulent conjunctivitis, a follicular reaction, papillary hypertrophy, vascularization of the cornea, and progressive cicatricial changes of the cornea and conjunctiva. Diagnosis is made by Giemsa stain, cell culture, or polymerase chain reaction. Treatment includes both topical and systemic erythromycin. Tetracycline can be used in &#173;children 8&#160;years of age and older.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Adult inclusion conjunctivitis</span> Adult inclusion conjunctivitis is a sexually transmitted disease that can be found in sexually active adolescents in association with chlamydial urethritis or cervicitis. However, &#173;there are nonsexual modes of transmission, including shared eye cosmetics and contaminated swimming pools. Patients pres&#173;ent with follicular conjunctivitis, scant mucopurulent discharge, and preauricular lymphadenopathy. &#173;There is no membrane formation. This condition can be diagnosed by culture of conjunctival scrapings, polymerase chain reaction, direct fluo&#173;rescent antibody tests, and enzyme immunoassays. If untreated, inclusion conjunctivitis resolves spontaneously in 6–18 months. The recommended treatment is oral tetracycline, doxycycline, azithromycin, or erythromycin. The clinician should consider &#173;whether the patient has been sexually abused, especially if adult inclusion conjunctivitis is found in a young child.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Viral Conjunctivitis in Infants and &#173;Children</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Adenovirus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Viral conjunctivitis is most often caused by an adenovirus, a DNA virus that can cause a range of &#173;human diseases, including upper respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis. The following adenoviral diseases are listed with their associated serotypes: epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (serotypes 8, 19, and 37, subgroup D), pharyngoconjunctival fever (serotypes 3 and 7), acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (serotypes 11 and 21), and acute follicular conjunctivitis (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 10). Contact precautions are especially impor&#173;tant during the examination of infants. Outbreaks of adenoviral conjunctivitis have been associated with retinopathy of prematurity examinations in neonatal intensive care units. In neonates, adenoviral pneumonia can be fatal or lead to serious morbidity.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single">Haas J, Larson E, Ross B, See B, Saiman&#160;L. Epidemiology and diagnosis of hospital-&#173;acquired&#160;conjunctivitis among neonatal intensive care unit patients. <span class="italic">Pediatr Infect Dis&#160;J.</span>&#160;2005;24(7):586–589.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis</span> Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a highly contagious conjunctivitis that tends to occur in epidemic outbreaks. This infection is an acute bilateral follicular conjunctivitis that is usually unilateral at onset and associated with preauricular lymphadenopathy. Initial symptoms are foreign-&#173;body sensation and periorbital pain. A diffuse superficial keratitis is followed by focal epithelial lesions that stain. &#173;After 11–15 days, subepithelial opacities begin to form beneath the focal epithelial infiltrates. The epithelial component fades by day 30, but the subepithelial opacities may remain for up to 2&#160;years. In severe infections, particularly in infants, a conjunctival membrane forms and marked swelling of the eyelids occurs; &#173;these signs must be differentiated from &#173;those of orbital or preseptal cellulitis. In severe cases, complications include per&#173;sis&#173;tent subepithelial opacities and conjunctival scar formation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because EKC is easily transmitted, contact precautions must be maintained for up to 2 weeks. Isolation areas should be designated for examination of patients known or suspected to have adenoviral infections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnosis is usually based on clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion but can be confirmed in the office by a rapid immunodetection assay. The organism can be recovered from the eyes and throat for 2 weeks &#173;after onset, demonstrating that patients are infectious during this period. Treatment is supportive in most cases. Artificial tears and cold compresses can provide symptomatic relief. Topical corticosteroids may be used judiciously to decrease symptoms in severe cases and in cases of decreased vision secondary to subepithelial opacities; such agents may prolong the time to full recovery. Corticosteroid use in adenoviral infection is seldom indicated in &#173;children.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Pharyngoconjunctival fever</span> Pharyngoconjunctival fever pres&#173;ents with conjunctival hyperemia, subconjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctival edema, epiphora, and eyelid swelling, accompanied by sore throat and fever. Within a few days, a follicular conjunctival reaction and preauricular lymphadenopathy develop. Symptoms may last for 2 weeks or more. Treatment is supportive &#173;because no topical or systemic treatment alters the course of the disease.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Herpes simplex virus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conjunctivitis caused by HSV type 1 is covered in BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Varicella-&#173;zoster virus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Varicella-&#173;zoster virus (VZV) is a herpesvirus that can cause varicella and herpes zoster.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Varicella</span> Varicella (chickenpox) is a contagious viral exanthem of childhood caused by primary infection with VZV. Varicella vaccine is very effective in preventing severe disease, but immunized &#173;children exposed to VZV may have mild symptoms. Clinical manifestations of primary VZV infection include fever and characteristic vesicular lesions of the skin and mucous membranes. Except for eyelid vesicles and follicular conjunctivitis, ocular involvement is uncommon. Treatment of conjunctival disease is usually not necessary. Intravenous or oral acyclovir is recommended by the American Acad&#173;emy of Pediatrics in the treatment of immunocompromised &#173;children with varicella.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Herpes zoster</span> Reactivation of latent VZV in dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia results in herpes zoster. Vesicular lesions may erupt on the periorbital skin and are localized to a single dermatome, with subsequent ocular involvement (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-4</span>). Keratitis and anterior uveitis are most likely to occur if the nasociliary branch of cranial nerve V is affected.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Oral acyclovir is indicated in healthy &#173;children to shorten the course of the illness and decrease the risk of bacterial superinfection. Intravenous antiviral agents (famciclovir, valacyclovir, acyclovir) are indicated in immunocompromised patients or individuals with severe disseminated disease. Antiviral medi&#173;cations should be started within 72 hours of onset of symptoms.</p>
			<p class="h3">Epstein-&#173;Barr virus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epstein-&#173;Barr virus is a herpesvirus that can cause infectious mononucleosis, a benign and self-&#173;limited disease that occurs most commonly between ages 15 and 30&#160;years. Findings include fever, widespread lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, hepatic involvement, and the presence of aty&#173;pi&#173;cal lymphocytes in the circulating blood. Conjunctivitis is the most common ocular finding. Nummular keratitis may also occur. The diagnosis is confirmed with detection of immunoglobulin M antibodies to viral capsid antigens or with a positive result on the heterophile antibody test. Ocular treatment is cool compresses to the eyes.</p>
			<p class="h3">Molluscum contagiosum</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a DNA poxvirus and usually pres&#173;ents as numerous umbilicated skin lesions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-5A</span>). Lesions on or near the eyelid margin can release viral particles onto the conjunctival surface, resulting in a follicular conjunctivitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-5B</span>). Most lesions do not require treatment &#173;because they tend to resolve spontaneously; however, resolution can take months or years. Lesions causing conjunctivitis can be treated by incising each lesion and debriding the central core; in young &#173;children, such treatment usually requires general anesthesia.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Inflammatory Disease</p>
			<div id="Chapt20_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Blepharitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blepharitis is a common cause of chronic conjunctivitis in &#173;children. The signs and symptoms of blepharitis in &#173;children are similar to &#173;those in adults and include ocular irritation, conjunctival hyperemia, morning eyelid crusting, eyelid margin erythema, and meibomian gland obstruction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-6</span>). Intermittent blurred vision may occur &#173;because of tear film instability. Inferior keratitis may develop in more severe cases, leading to epithelial disruption and fluorescein staining, corneal scarring, and permanent vision loss (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 20-7</span>, <span class="xref-figure">20-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Recurrent chalazia in &#173;children may indicate under&#173;lying blepharitis. Acne rosacea in &#173;children may be manifested by chronic blepharitis and facial telangiectasias, papules, and pustules. <span class="italic">Demodex</span> (&#173;human mites that inhabit the hair follicles) may play a role in the pathogenesis of blepharitis and should be considered when blepharitis does not respond to treatment. Patients with demodicosis typically pres&#173;ent with a waxy, sleevelike buildup at the base of eyelashes. Demodicosis may respond to dilute tea tree oil applied to lash bases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Initial treatment of blepharitis includes warm compresses, eyelid scrubs with baby shampoo, and erythromycin or bacitracin ophthalmic ointment or azithromycin ophthalmic solution, 1%. Severe cases may benefit from oral antibiotic use. Tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline) and macrolides (erythromycin, azithromycin) may be helpful. Macrolides are most commonly used in &#173;children younger than 8 years to avoid the potential dental staining associated with use of tetracyclines. Judicious use of topical corticosteroids may be indicated in patients with corneal disease. Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids may benefit some patients.</p>

			<p class="h2">Ocular Allergy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Allergies are thought to affect approximately 20% of the US and Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean populations; more than 50% of patients who seek treatment for allergies pres&#173;ent with ocular symptoms. Allergic ocular disease is a common prob&#173;lem in &#173;children and is often associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Marked itching and bilateral conjunctival inflammation of a chronic, recurrent, and possibly seasonal nature are hallmarks of external ocular disease of allergic origin. Other signs and symptoms may be nonspecific and include tearing, stinging, burning, and photophobia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Four specific types of ocular allergy are discussed in this section: seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC). All have some ele&#173;ment of a type I hypersensitivity reaction caused by the interaction between an allergen and specific immunoglobulin E antibodies on the surface of mast cells in the conjunctiva. This interaction initiates a cascade of biochemical events involved in mediation of the allergic response. Among the mediators released is histamine, which &#173;causes much of the itching, vasodilation, and edema that are characteristic of the ocular allergic response.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is a common clinical entity that affects approximately 40 million &#173;people in the United States, including many &#173;children. It occurs in the spring and fall and is triggered by environmental contact with specific airborne allergens such as pollens from grasses, flowers, weeds, and trees. Patients typically pres&#173;ent with red and watery eyes, boggy-&#173;appearing conjunctiva, and ocular itching (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-9</span>). Blue-&#173;gray to purple discoloration of the lower eyelids, termed <span class="italic">allergic shiners,</span> can occur secondary to venous stasis from nasal congestion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The signs, symptoms, and pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of perennial allergic conjunctivitis are similar to &#173;those of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Perennial allergic conjunctivitis is a type I hypersensitivity reaction that occurs &#173;after contact with ubiquitous &#173;house&#173;hold allergens, such as dust mites and dander from domestic pets. This condition is diagnosed based on the history and clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of all ocular allergy disorders is fundamentally similar to that of other allergy-&#173;related disorders. The most effective treatment is to avoid offending allergens or remove them from the patient’s environment. Unfortunately, avoidance may not be pos&#173;si&#173;ble and complete removal may not be adequate to alleviate the patient’s symptoms. Medical treatment can be systemic or topical. Although oral antihistamines may be less effective at relieving specific ocular symptoms, they are often better tolerated in &#173;children, who may not accept eyedrops.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Topical medi&#173;cations include mast-&#173;cell stabilizers, H<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">1</span>-&#173;receptor antagonists, antihistamines, vasoconstrictors, corticosteroids, or combinations of &#173;these drugs (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;20-2</span>). H<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">1</span>-&#173;receptor antagonists can be used on an as-&#173;needed basis, but mast-&#173;cell stabilizers must be used for a few days before an effect is seen. In addition, mast-&#173;cell stabilizers should be used continuously through the allergy season to maximize their effectiveness. Nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drops should be used with caution; cases of corneal perforation, though rare, have been reported. Topical corticosteroid drops used in pulsed doses can effectively reduce severe allergic ocular symptoms, but patients must be closely monitored for adverse effects, including glaucoma and cataracts.</p>
			<p class="h3">Vernal keratoconjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is caused by type I and type IV hypersensitivity reactions. This condition most commonly affects males in the first 2 de&#173;cades of life and, like seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, usually occurs in the spring and fall. &#173;There are 2 forms of VKC: palpebral and limbal (or bulbar). Both types manifest with severe itching. The limbal form is more common in patients of African or Asian descent and is more prevalent in warm, subtropical climates.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinically, the palpebral form of VKC preferentially affects the tarsal conjunctiva of the upper eyelid. In the early stages, the eye may be diffusely injected, with &#173;little discharge. &#173;There may be no progression beyond this stage. However, papillae may multiply, covering the tarsal area with a mosaic of flat papules (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-10</span>). A thick, ropy, whitish discharge may be pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The limbal form of VKC manifests early with thickening and opacification of the conjunctiva at the limbus, usually most marked at the upper margin of the cornea. The discrete limbal nodules that appear are gray, jelly-&#173;like, elevated lumps with vascular cores. A whitish center filled with eosinophils and epithelioid cells may appear in the raised lesion. This complex is called a <span class="italic">Horner-&#173;Trantas dot.</span> Limbal nodules may increase in number and become confluent (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-11</span>). They persist as long as the seasonal exacerbation of the disease lasts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cornea may become involved, with punctate epithelial erosions, especially superiorly. Corneal involvement may pro&#173;gress to a large, confluent epithelial defect, typically in the upper half of the cornea, called a <span class="italic">shield ulcer.</span> The ulcer is sterile and clinically resembles an ovoid corneal abrasion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-12</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of VKC is usually less effective than that of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Eyedrops combining a mast-&#173;cell stabilizer and an H<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">1</span>-&#173;receptor antagonist may be used initially. In addition, treatment of VKC often requires topical ste&#173;roids or topical cyclospor&#173;ine. Supratarsal injection of corticosteroids may be used in patients with refractory palpebral VKC.</p>
			<p class="h3">Atopic keratoconjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a nonseasonal disorder that occurs in patients with atopic disease. It is relatively rare in &#173;children. See BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ligneous Conjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ligneous conjunctivitis is a rare bilateral chronic disorder characterized by firm (“woody”), yellowish, fibrinous pseudomembranes on the palpebral conjunctiva. It is thought to be secondary to severe deficiency in type I plasminogen and can affect persons of all ages. No single treatment is consistently effective. Surgical removal, amniotic membrane transplantation, fresh frozen plasma, and heparin have been used.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Papillomas are benign epithelial proliferations that usually appear as sessile masses at the limbus or as pedunculated lesions of the caruncle, fornix, or palpebral conjunctiva. They may be transparent, pale yellow, or salmon colored and are sometimes speckled with red dots. Papillomas in &#173;children usually result from viral infection. They often resolve spontaneously. Oral cimetidine can induce papilloma regression. Carbon dioxide &#173;laser or surgical incision is indicated when symptoms are severe or if new lesions continue to appear. Seeding may follow excision, leading to recurrence.</p>
			<p class="h2">Conjunctival Epithelial Inclusion Cysts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conjunctival inclusion cysts are clear, fluid-&#173;filled cysts on the conjunctiva. &#173;These cysts are often noted in patients who had ocular surgery or trauma. Excision is indicated if the cyst &#173;causes irritation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Conjunctival Nevi</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conjunctival nevi are relatively common in childhood. Nevocellular nevi of the conjunctiva consist of nests or more diffuse infiltrations of benign melanocytes. Histologically, most of &#173;these nevi are compound (nevus cells found in both epithelium and substantia propria); &#173;others are junctional (nevus cells confined to the interface between epithelium and substantia propria). The lesions are occasionally noted at birth. More commonly, they develop during &#173;later childhood or adolescence. The lesions may be flat or elevated. Nevi are typically brown, but approximately one-&#173;third are nonpigmented and have a pinkish appearance (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-13</span>). Removal may be indicated if significant growth occurs, although transformation to malignant melanoma is extremely rare in childhood.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ocular Melanocytosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular melanocytosis <span class="italic">(melanosis oculi)</span> is a congenital focal proliferation of subepithelial melanocytes characterized by unilateral patchy but extensive slate-&#173;gray or bluish discoloration of the episclera (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-14</span>). Intraocular pigmentation is also increased, which is associated with a higher incidence of glaucoma and risk of malignant melanoma. Some patients, particularly persons of Asian ancestry, may have associated involvement of eyelid and adjacent skin with dermal hyperpigmentation that produces brown, bluish, or black discoloration without thickening <span class="italic">(oculodermal melanocytosis, nevus of Ota).</span> Small patches of slate-&#173;gray scleral pigmentation, typically bilateral and without clinical significance, are common in black and Asian &#173;children. Melanosis of skin and sclera is occasionally associated with Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome and Klippel-&#173;Tr<span class="accent">é</span>naunay-&#173;Weber syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h2">Stevens-&#173;Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare hypersensitivity reactions that affect skin and mucous membranes. The most common etiologies of SJS and TEN in &#173;children are medi&#173;cations (usually anticonvulsants and sulfonamides) and infections (usually <span class="italic">Mycoplasma</span> species or herpes simplex virus). The pathogenesis of SJS and TEN is discussed in BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic manifestations range from mild to severe. A prodrome of fever, malaise, and upper respiratory tract infection is followed by bullous mucosal and skin lesions. &#173;These lesions rupture, ulcerate, and become covered by gray-&#173;white membranes and a hemorrhagic crust.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular involvement, which occurs in as many as 50% of patients, varies from mild mucopurulent conjunctivitis to severe perforating corneal ulcers. Ocular involvement in SJS and TEN begins with edema, erythema, and crusting of the eyelids. The palpebral conjunctiva becomes hyperemic, and distinct vesicles or bullae may occur. In many instances, epithelial defects or ulcers involving the tarsus and fornices develop. In severe cases, membranous or pseudomembranous conjunctivitis may occur (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 20-15</span>) and lead to symblepharon formation. Superinfection, most commonly with <span class="italic">Staphylococcus</span> species, may develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Late ocular complications, possibly accompanied by a decrease in vision, occur in approximately 27% of pediatric patients. &#173;These complications include anomalies of eyelid position (ectropion and entropion), dry eye disease, trichiasis, chronic conjunctivitis, corneal defects, corneal vascularization, and symblepharon formation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">SJS and TEN are considered a disease continuum, distinguished by severity. The current nomenclature is based on the amount of skin involvement, with SJS being of lesser severity; TEN, greater severity; and SJS-&#173;TEN in between &#173;these. They are diagnosed based on clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion and skin biopsy results. Initial management includes treatment of any under&#173;lying infection and discontinuation of any inciting drug. Systemic therapy with corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin is controversial. The mortality rate for &#173;these conditions is much lower in &#173;children than in adults: 0% in SJS, 4% in SJS-&#173;TEN, and 16% in TEN. A full discussion of systemic treatment is beyond the scope of this book. A dermatologist and a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases should be consulted.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Early intervention is impor&#173;tant for preventing the late ocular complications of SJS, SJS-&#173;TEN, and TEN. Ocular lubrication with artificial tears and ointments (preferably preservative-&#173;free) should be applied frequently. Associated microbial infections should be treated. The fornices may be swept to lyse adhesions, although some ophthalmologists believe that &#173;doing so may stimulate inflammation and cause further scarring. In severe cases, a symblepharon ring may be useful in cooperative patients. In patients with significant ocular disease, a corneal ban&#173;dage device using amniotic membrane or amniotic membrane grafting should be considered early to decrease the risk of late ocular complications.</p>
