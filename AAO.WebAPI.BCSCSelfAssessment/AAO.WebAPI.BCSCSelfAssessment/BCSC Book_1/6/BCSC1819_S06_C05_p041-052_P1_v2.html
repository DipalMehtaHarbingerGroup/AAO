			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">The Physiology of Normal Binocular Vision</p>
					<div id="Chapt5_Top1"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If an area of the ret&#173;ina is stimulated by any means—&#173;externally by light or internally by mechanical pressure or electrical processes—&#173;the resulting sensation is always one of light, and the light is subjectively localized as coming from a specific visual direction in space. The imaginary line connecting the fixation point and the fovea is termed the <span class="italic">visual axis,</span> and normally, with central fixation, it is subjectively localized straight ahead.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Correspondence</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If the stimulated areas of the ret&#173;i&#173;nas in the 2 eyes, or ret&#173;i&#173;nal locations, share a common subjective visual direction—&#173;that is, if stimulation of &#173;these 2 points results in the subjective sensation that the stimulating target or targets lie in the same direction—&#173;these ret&#173;i&#173;nal locations are said to be <span class="italic">corresponding.</span> When the image of an object in space falls on corresponding points, it is perceived as a single object. On the other hand, stimulation of <span class="italic">noncorresponding</span> or <span class="italic">disparate</span> ret&#173;i&#173;nal points results in the sensation of 2 visual directions for the same target, or diplopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With <span class="italic">normal ret&#173;i&#173;nal correspondence,</span> the foveae of the 2 eyes are corresponding points. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal areas in each eye that are essentially equidistant to the right or left and above or below the fovea are also corresponding points. The locus of points in space that stimulate corresponding points in each ret&#173;ina is known as the <span class="italic">horopter.</span> With symmetric convergence, the geometric relationship between corresponding points—&#173;for example, a point 1° nasal to the fovea in 1 eye would correspond to a point 1° temporal to the fovea in the other eye—&#173;gives a circle that passes through the nodal point of each eye and the point of fixation. This theoretical horopter is known as the <span class="italic">Vieth-&#173;M</span><span class="accent_I">ü</span><span class="italic">ller circle.</span> When the horopter is determined experimentally, the locus of points that are seen singly falls not on a circle but on a curve called the <span class="italic">empirical horopter</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 5-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The horopter exists in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Although it might seem that the horopter would be a surface in space, the horizontal separation of the eyes &#173;causes points in the oblique quadrants to be vertically disparate. For symmetric convergence, the 3-&#173;dimensional horopter of points having both horizontal and vertical correspondence consists of a curved horizontal line and a sloped vertical line that intersect at the fixation point. Each fixation point has a unique horopter centered on that point.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the horopter includes all points in space that stimulate corresponding ret&#173;i&#173;nal points, double vision would be expected when the target does not lie on the horopter. However, the visual system can combine slightly disparate points within a limited area surrounding the horopter, called <span class="italic">Panum’s area of single binocular vision</span> (see Fig 5-1). Objects within Panum’s area do not result in diplopia. Objects outside Panum’s area stimulate widely disparate ret&#173;i&#173;nal points, resulting in physiologic diplopia. If an object is distal to Panum’s area, uncrossed physiologic diplopia &#173;will result; if an object is proximal to Panum’s area, crossed physiologic diplopia &#173;will result.</p>
			<p class="h2">Fusion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Fusion</span> is the cortical unification of 2 images of an object, 1 from each eye, into a single percept. For ret&#173;i&#173;nal images to be fused, they must be similar in size and shape. For fusion of macular images <span class="italic">(central fusion)</span> to occur, &#173;there can be very &#173;little dissimilarity between the images in each eye, &#173;because of the small receptive fields in the area near the fovea; other&#173;wise, diplopia results. More image dissimilarity is tolerated in the periphery (peripheral fusion), where the receptive fields are larger. Fusion has been artificially subdivided into sensory fusion, motor fusion, and stereopsis.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Sensory fusion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sensory fusion is based on the innate, orderly topographic relationship between the ret&#173;i&#173;nas and the visual cortex, whereby images falling on corresponding (or nearly corresponding) ret&#173;i&#173;nal points in the 2 eyes are combined to form a single visual percept.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Motor fusion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Motor fusion is a vergence movement that allows similar ret&#173;i&#173;nal images to be maintained on corresponding ret&#173;i&#173;nal areas despite natu&#173;ral conditions (eg, heterophorias) or artificial &#173;causes that induce disparities. For example, when a progressive base-&#173;out prism is introduced before both eyes while a target is viewed, the ret&#173;i&#173;nal images move temporally over both ret&#173;i&#173;nas if the eyes remain in fixed position. However, &#173;because of a response called <span class="italic">fusional convergence</span> (see Chapter&#160;4), the eyes instead converge, repositioning so that similar ret&#173;i&#173;nal images are projected on corresponding ret&#173;i&#173;nal areas. Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of fusional vergence amplitudes is discussed in Chapter&#160;7.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Stereopsis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Stereopsis occurs when horizontal ret&#173;i&#173;nal disparity between the 2 eyes produces a subjective ordering of images of objects in depth, or 3 dimensions. It is the highest form of binocular cooperation and adds a unique quality to vision. The region of points with binocular disparities that result in stereopsis is slightly wider than Panum’s area, so stereopsis is not simply a by-&#173;product of combining the disparate images from a point into a single visual percept. The brain interprets nasal disparity between 2 similar ret&#173;i&#173;nal images of an object in the midline as indicating that the object is farther away from the fixation point, and temporal disparity as indicating that the object is nearer. Binasal or bitemporal images are not a requirement for stereopsis; objects not in the midline in front of or &#173;behind the horopter also elicit stereopsis, even though their images fall on the nasal ret&#173;ina in 1 eye and the temporal ret&#173;ina in the other.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Stereopsis and depth perception <span class="italic">(bathopsis)</span> are not synonymous. Monocular cues—&#173;which include object overlap, relative object size, highlights and shadows, motion parallax, and perspective—&#173;also contribute to depth perception. Monocular patients can have excellent depth perception using &#173;these cues. Stereopsis is a <span class="italic">binocular</span> sensation of relative depth caused by horizontal disparity of ret&#173;i&#173;nal images.</p>

			<p class="h1">Selected Aspects of the Neurophysiology of Vision</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top2"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The decussation of the optic nerves at the chiasm is essential for the development of binocular vision and stereopsis. With decussation, visual information from corresponding ret&#173;i&#173;nal areas in each eye runs through the lateral geniculate body (lateral geniculate nucleus) and optic tracts to the visual cortex, where the information from both eyes is commingled and modified by the integration of vari&#173;ous inputs. See BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> Chapter&#160;1, for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Visual Development</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the &#173;human ret&#173;ina, most of the ganglion cells are generated between 8 and 15 weeks’ gestation, reaching a plateau of 2.2–2.5 million by week 18. &#173;After week 30, the ret&#173;i&#173;nal ganglion cell (RGC) population decreases dramatically during a period of rapid cell death (a pro&#173;cess termed <span class="italic">apoptosis</span>) that lasts 6–8 weeks. Thereafter, RGC death continues at a low rate into the first few postnatal months. The RGC population is reduced to a final count of approximately 1.0–1.5 million. The loss of about 1 million RGC axons may serve to refine the topography and specificity of the retinogeniculate projection by eliminating inappropriate connections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The continued development of visual function &#173;after birth is accompanied by major anatomical changes, which occur at all levels of the central visual pathways. The fovea is still covered by multiple cell layers and is sparsely packed with cones, which, in addition to neural immaturity, contributes to the estimated visual acuity of 20/400&#160;in the newborn. During the first years of life, the photoreceptors redistribute within the ret&#173;ina, and foveal cone density increases fivefold to achieve the configuration found in the mature ret&#173;ina. In newborns, the white &#173;matter of the visual pathways is not fully myelinated. Myelin sheaths enlarge rapidly in the first 2&#160;years &#173;after birth and then more slowly through the first de&#173;cade of life. At birth, the neurons of the lateral geniculate body are only 60% of their average adult size. Their volume gradually increases &#173;until age 2&#160;years. Refinement of synaptic connections in the striate cortex continues for many years &#173;after birth. The density of synapses declines by 40% over several years, attaining final adult levels at approximately age 10&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology,</span> for further discussion of ocular development.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Effects of Abnormal Visual Experience on the Retinogeniculocortical Pathway</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Abnormal visual experience resulting from visual deprivation, anisometropia, or strabismus can powerfully affect retinogeniculocortical development. In studies of baby macaque monkeys, single-&#173;eyelid suturing usually produces axial myopia but no other significant anatomical changes in the eye. The lateral geniculate laminae that receive input from the deprived eye experience minor shrinkage, but &#173;these cells respond rapidly to visual stimulation, suggesting that a defect in the lateral geniculate body is not likely to account for amblyopia. In the striate cortex, monocular visual deprivation &#173;causes the regions of the visual cortex driven predominantly by the closed eye (ocular dominance columns) to radically narrow (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 5-2</span>). This occurs &#173;because the 2 eyes compete for synaptic contacts in the cortex. As a result, the deprived eye loses many of the connections already formed at birth with postsynaptic cortical targets. The open eye profits by the sprouting of terminal arbors beyond their usual bound&#173;aries to occupy territory relinquished by the deprived eye &#173;(<span class="xref-figure">Fig </span><span class="xref-figure">5-3</span>). However, the benefit derived from invading the cortical territory of the deprived eye is unclear &#173;because visual acuity does not improve beyond normal. Positron emission tomography has shown that cortical blood flow and glucose metabolism are lower during stimulation of the amblyopic eye compared with the normal eye, suggesting the visual cortex as the primary site of amblyopia. Monocular deprivation also devastates binocularity &#173;because few cells can be driven by both eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There is a critical period in which visual development in the macaque is vulnerable to the effects of eyelid suturing. This period corresponds to the stage in which wiring of the striate cortex is still vulnerable to the effects of visual deprivation. During the critical period, the deleterious effects of suturing the right eyelid, for example, are correctable by reversal—&#173;that is, opening the sutured right eye and closing the left eye. &#173;After this reversal, the ocular dominance columns of the initially closed right eye appear practically normal, indicating that anatomical recovery of the initially shrunken columns was induced by opening the right eye and closing the left eye. However, when the right eye is sewn closed beyond the critical period, the columns of the right eye do not re-&#173;expand if the right eye is opened and the left eye closed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Eyelid suturing in the baby macaque is a good model for visual deprivation ambly&#173;opia. In &#173;children, this condition can be caused by any dense opacity of the ocular media or occlusion by the eyelid. Visual deprivation can rapidly cause profound amblyopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There are other &#173;causes of amblyopia in &#173;children. Optical defocus resulting from anisometropia &#173;causes the cortical neurons driven by the defocused eye to be less sensitive (particularly to higher spatial frequencies, &#173;because they are most affected by blur) and to send out a weaker signal. This results in reduced binocular activity. The critical period for anisometropic amblyopia occurs &#173;later than that for strabismic amblyopia, and a prolonged period of unilateral blur is necessary before anisometropic amblyopia develops. Meridional (astigmatic) amblyopia does not develop during the first year of life and may not develop &#173;until age 3&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Strabismus can be artificially created in monkeys by the sectioning of an extraocular muscle. Alternating fixation develops in some monkeys &#173;after this procedure; they maintain normal acuity in each eye. Examination of the striate cortex reveals cells with normal receptive fields and an equal number of cells responsive to stimulation of &#173;either eye. However, the cortex is bereft of binocular cells (see Fig 5-3). &#173;After 1 extraocular muscle is cut, some monkeys do not alternately fixate; instead, they constantly fixate with the same eye, and amblyopia develops in the deviating eye. An impor&#173;tant &#173;factor in the development of strabismic amblyopia is interocular suppression due to uncorrelated images in the 2&#160;eyes. Strabismus prevents synchronous attainment of correlated images from the 2 foveae, resulting in abnormal input to the striate cortex. Another &#173;factor is the optical defocus of the deviated eye. The dominant eye is focused on the object of regard, while the deviated eye is oriented in a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent direction; for the deviated eye, the object may be too near or too far to be in focus. &#173;Either mechanism can cause asynchrony or inhibition of 1 set of signals in the striate cortex. The critical period for development of strabismic amblyopia begins at approximately 4 months of age, during the time of ocular dominance segregation and sensitivity to binocular correlation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Abnormal sensory input alone is sufficient to alter the normal anatomy of the visual cortex. Other areas of the ce&#173;re&#173;bral cortex may also depend on sensory stimulation to form the proper anatomical cir&#173;cuits necessary for normal adult visual function, underscoring the importance of providing &#173;children with a stimulating sensory environment.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Abnormalities of Binocular Vision</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top3"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When a manifest deviation of the eyes occurs, the corresponding ret&#173;i&#173;nal ele&#173;ments of the eyes are no longer directed at the same object. This places the patient at risk for 2 distinct visual phenomena: visual confusion and diplopia.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Visual Confusion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Visual confusion is the perception of a common visual direction for 2 separate objects. The 2 foveal areas are physiologically incapable of simultaneous perception of dissimilar objects. The closest foveal equivalent is <span class="italic">ret&#173;i&#173;nal rivalry,</span> wherein &#173;there is rapid alternation of the 2 perceived images (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 5-4</span>). Confusion may be a phenomenon of extrafoveal ret&#173;i&#173;nal areas only. Clinically significant visual confusion is rare.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Diplopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Double vision, or <span class="italic">diplopia,</span> usually results from an acquired misalignment of the visual axes that &#173;causes an image to fall si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously on the fovea of one eye and on a nonfoveal point in the other eye. As stated earlier, the object that falls on &#173;these disparate ret&#173;i&#173;nal points must be outside Panum’s area to appear double. The same object is perceived as having 2 locations in subjective space, and the foveal image is always clearer than the nonfoveal image of the nonfixating eye. The perception of diplopia depends on the age at onset, its duration, and the patient’s subjective awareness of it. The younger the child, the greater the ability to suppress, or inhibit, the nonfoveal image. Adults with acquired strabismus commonly pres&#173;ent to the ophthalmologist &#173;because of diplopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The loss of normal binocular fusion in an individual unable to suppress disparate ret&#173;i&#173;nal images results in intractable diplopia, referred to as <span class="italic">central fusion disruption (horror fusionis).</span> This condition is typically seen in adults or visually mature &#173;children and can occur in a number of clinical settings, including prolonged visual deprivation due to monocular occlusion or a mature cataract, traumatic brain injury, or long-&#173;standing strabismus. Management is challenging.</p>

			<p class="h1">Sensory Adaptations in Strabismus</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top4"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">To avoid visual confusion and diplopia, the visual system uses the mechanisms of suppression and anomalous ret&#173;i&#173;nal correspondence (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 5-5</span>). Pathologic suppression and anomalous ret&#173;i&#173;nal correspondence develop only in the immature visual system.</p>
			<p class="h2">Suppression</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Suppression is the alteration of visual sensation that occurs when an eye’s ret&#173;i&#173;nal image is inhibited or prevented from reaching consciousness during binocular visual activity. Physiologic suppression is the mechanism that prevents physiologic diplopia (diplopia elicited by objects outside Panum’s area) from reaching consciousness. Pathologic suppression may develop &#173;because of strabismic misalignment of the visual axes or other conditions resulting in discordant images in each eye, such as cataract or anisometropia. Such suppression can be regarded as an adaptation within the immature visual system to avoid diplopia. If a patient with strabismus and normal ret&#173;i&#173;nal correspondence (NRC) does not have diplopia, suppression is pres&#173;ent, provided the sensory pathways are intact. In less obvious situations, several &#173;simple tests are available for clinical diagnosis of suppression (see Chapter&#160;7).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following classification of suppression may be useful for the clinician:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Central versus peripheral. Central suppression</span> is the mechanism that keeps the foveal image of the deviating eye from reaching consciousness, thereby preventing visual confusion. <span class="italic">Peripheral suppression,</span> another mechanism, eliminates diplopia by preventing awareness of the image that falls on the peripheral ret&#173;ina in the deviating eye, which corresponds to the image falling on the fovea of the fixating eye. This form of suppression is clearly pathologic, developing as a cortical adaptation only within an immature visual system. When strabismus develops &#173;after visual maturation/in adults, peripheral suppression does not develop and the patient is thus unable to eliminate the peripheral second image without closing or occluding the deviating eye.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Nonalternating versus alternating.</span> If suppression always &#173;causes the image from the dominant eye to be predominant over the image from the deviating eye, the suppression is <span class="italic">nonalternating.</span> This may lead to amblyopia. If the pro&#173;cess switches between the 2 eyes, the suppression is described as <span class="italic">alternating.</span></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">Facultative versus constant.</span> Suppression may be considered <span class="italic">facultative</span> if it is pres&#173;ent only when the eyes are deviated and is absent in all other states. Patients with intermittent exotropia, for instance, often experience suppression when the eyes are divergent but may experience high-&#173;grade stereopsis when the eyes are straight. In contrast, <span class="italic">constant suppression</span> denotes suppression that is always pres&#173;ent, &#173;whether the eyes are deviated or aligned. The suppression scotoma in the deviating eye may be &#173;either <span class="italic">relative</span> (permitting some visual sensation) or <span class="italic">absolute</span> (permitting no perception of light).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3">Management of suppression</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Therapy for suppression often includes the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-6">proper refractive correction</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">amblyopia therapy using occlusion or pharmacologic treatment</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-7">alignment of the visual axes, to permit simultaneous stimulation of corresponding ret&#173;i&#173;nal ele&#173;ments by the same object</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Antisuppression orthoptic exercises may result in intractable diplopia and are not typically recommended.</p>
			<p class="h2">Anomalous Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Correspondence</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Anomalous ret&#173;i&#173;nal correspondence (ARC)</span> is a condition wherein the fovea of the fixating eye has acquired an anomalous common visual direction with a peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal ele&#173;ment in the deviating eye. ARC is an adaptation that restores some degree of binocular cooperation despite manifest strabismus. Anomalous binocular vision is a functional state that is superior to total suppression. In the development of ARC, normal sensory development is replaced only gradually and not completely. The more long-&#173;standing the deviation, the more deeply rooted the ARC may become. The period during which ARC may develop prob&#173;ably extends through the first de&#173;cade of life.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Paradoxical diplopia</span> can occur when ARC persists &#173;after strabismus surgery. For example, when esotropic patients with proper or nearly proper ocular alignment &#173;after surgery report symptoms of a crossed diplopic localization of foveal or parafoveal stimuli, they are experiencing paradoxical diplopia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 5-6</span>). Paradoxical diplopia is typically a fleeting postoperative phenomenon, seldom lasting longer than a few days or weeks, but in rare cases it can persist much longer.</p>
			<p class="h3">Testing for anomalous ret&#173;i&#173;nal correspondence</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Testing for ARC is performed to determine how affected patients use their eyes in everyday life and to seek any vestiges of normal correspondence. As discussed earlier, ARC is a sensory adaptation to abnormal ocular alignment. &#173;Because the depth of the sensory rearrangement can vary widely, an individual can test positive for both NRC and ARC. Tests that closely simulate everyday use of the eyes are more likely to give evidence of ARC. The more dissociative the test, the more likely it is to produce an NRC response, &#173;unless the ARC is deeply rooted. Some of the more common tests (discussed at length in Chapter&#160;7), in order of most to least dissociative, are the afterimage test, the Worth 4-&#173;dot test, the red-&#173;glass test (dissociation increases with the density of the red filter), amblyoscope testing, and testing with Bagolini striated lenses. If an anomalous localization response occurs in the more dissociative tests, the depth of ARC is greater.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Note that ARC is a binocular phenomenon, tested for and documented in both eyes si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously. It is not necessarily related to eccentric fixation (see Chapter&#160;6), which is a monocular phenomenon found in testing 1 eye alone. &#173;Because some tests for ARC depend on separate stimulation of each fovea, the presence of eccentric fixation can significantly affect the test results (see also Chapter&#160;7).</p>
			<p class="h2">Monofixation Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">monofixation syndrome</span> is used to describe a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of a sensory state in strabismus. The essential feature of this syndrome is the presence of peripheral fusion with the absence of bifoveal fusion due to a central scotoma. The term <span class="italic">microtropia</span> was introduced separately to describe small-&#173;angle strabismus with a constellation of findings that largely overlap &#173;those of monofixation syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A patient with monofixation syndrome may have no manifest deviation but usually has a small (<span class="symbol">≤</span>8 prism diopters [<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>]) heterotropia; the heterotropia is most commonly an esotropia but is sometimes an exotropia or hypertropia. Stereoacuity is pres&#173;ent but reduced. Amblyopia is a common finding.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Monofixation syndrome is a favorable outcome of infantile strabismus surgery and is pres&#173;ent in a substantial minority of patients with intermittent exotropia. It can also be a primary condition that &#173;causes unilaterally decreased vision when no obvious strabismus is pres&#173;ent. Monofixation syndrome can result from anisometropia or macular lesions as well.</p>
			<p class="h3">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">To diagnose monofixation syndrome, the clinician must demonstrate the absence of bimacular fusion by documenting a macular scotoma in the nonfixating eye &#173;under binocular conditions and the presence of peripheral binocular vision (peripheral fusion).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vectographic projections of Snellen letters can be used to document the facultative scotoma of monofixation syndrome. Snellen letters are viewed through polarized analyzers or goggles equipped with liquid-&#173;crystal shutters so that some letters are seen with only the right eye, some with only the left eye, and some with both eyes. Patients with monofixation syndrome omit letters that are imaged only in the nonfixating eye. Various other tests for central suppression are more commonly used (see Chapter&#160;7).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Testing stereoacuity is an impor&#173;tant part of the monofixation syndrome evaluation. Any amount of gross stereopsis confirms the presence of peripheral fusion. Most patients with monofixation syndrome demonstrate stereopsis of 200–3000 seconds of arc. However, &#173;because some patients with this syndrome have no demonstrable stereopsis, other tests for peripheral fusion, such as the Worth 4-&#173;dot test and testing with Bagolini lenses, must be used in conjunction with stereoacuity mea&#173;sure&#173;ment. Fine stereopsis (better than 67 seconds of arc) is pres&#173;ent only in patients with bifoveal fixation.</p>
