			<p class="chapter-title">Pattern Strabismus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Pattern strabismus</span> is a horizontal deviation in which &#173;there is a difference in the magnitude of deviation between upgaze and downgaze. The term <span class="italic">V pattern</span> describes a horizontal deviation that is more divergent (less convergent) in upgaze than in downgaze, while the term <span class="italic">A</span> <span class="italic">pattern</span> describes a horizontal deviation that is more divergent (less convergent) in downgaze than in upgaze. An A or V pattern is found in 15%–25% of horizontal strabismus cases. Less common variations of pattern strabismus include Y, X, and <span class="greek--tx-"></span> (lambda) patterns.</p>
			<p class="h1">Etiology</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following conditions are associated with vari&#173;ous types of pattern strabismus or considered &#173;causes of &#173;these patterns.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Oblique muscle dysfunction.</span> Apparent inferior oblique muscle overaction (<span class="italic">overel</span><span class="italic">eva</span><span class="italic">tion in adduction [OEAd];</span> see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span>) is associated with V patterns (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-</span><span class="xref-figure">1</span>), and apparent superior oblique muscle overaction <span class="italic">(overdepression in adduction [ODAd])</span> with A patterns (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-2</span>). &#173;These associations may be due to the tertiary abducting action of &#173;these muscles in upgaze and downgaze, respectively; however, oblique dysfunction is frequently associated with ocular torsion that can also contribute to A or V patterns (see below).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Orbital pulley system abnormalities.</span> Abnormalities (heterotopia) of the orbital pulley system (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;3</span>) have been described as a cause of simulated oblique muscle overactions and of altered rectus muscle pathways and functions that can result in A or V patterns. &#173;These pulley effects may help explain the observation that patients with upward-&#173; or downward-&#173;slanting palpebral fissures (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-3</span>) may show A or V patterns &#173;because of an under&#173;lying variation in orbital configuration, which is reflected in the orientation of the fissures. Similarly, patients with craniofacial anomalies (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;18</span>) may have a V-&#173;pattern strabismus with marked elevation of the adducting eye as a manifestation of rotation of the orbits, pulley system, and muscle pathways.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Ocular torsion.</span> While not as consequential as pulley dystopia, ocular torsion displaces the anterior path of the vertical rectus muscles. Extorsion displaces the superior rectus muscle temporally and the inferior rectus muscle nasally, which tends to produce a V pattern. Intorsion displaces the superior rectus nasally and the inferior rectus temporally, which tends to produce an A pattern.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Restricted horizontal rectus muscles.</span> Contracture of the lateral rectus muscles in large-&#173;angle exotropia may result in an X pattern, with globe slippage in adduction.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Anomalous innervation.</span> Sometimes seen in isolation and sometimes associated with other congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (see Chapter&#160;12), this most commonly produces a Y pattern.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-1"><span class="italic">Selective innervation of superior or inferior compartments of the horizontal rectus muscles.</span> This is a pos&#173;si&#173;ble contributing &#173;factor to A and V patterns and is &#173;under investigation (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;3</span>).</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Clinical Features and Identification of Pattern Strabismus</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The presence of A and V patterns is determined by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing alignment while the patient fixates on an accommodative target at distance, with fusion prevented with the prism alternate cover test, in primary position and in straight upgaze and downgaze, approximately 25° from the primary position. Proper refractive correction is necessary during mea&#173;sure&#173;ment &#173;because an uncompensated accommodative component can induce exaggerated convergence in downgaze. The examiner should look specifically for apparent oblique muscle overaction (OEAd or ODAd) &#173;because of its frequent association with pattern strabismus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An A pattern is considered clinically significant when the difference in mea&#173;sure&#173;ment between upgaze and downgaze is at least 10 prism diopters (<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>). For a V pattern, this difference must be at least 15<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span> &#173;because &#173;there is normally some physiologic convergence in downgaze.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">V Pattern</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common type of pattern strabismus, V pattern occurs most frequently in patients with infantile esotropia. The pattern is usually not pres&#173;ent when the esotropia first develops but becomes apparent during the first year of life or &#173;later. V patterns may also occur in patients with superior oblique palsies, particularly if they are bilateral, and in patients with craniofacial malformations.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">A Pattern</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A pattern is the second most common type of pattern strabismus and occurs most frequently in patients with exotropia and in persons with spina bifida.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Y Pattern</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with Y patterns (pseudo-&#173;overaction of the inferior oblique muscle) have normal ocular alignment in primary position and downgaze, but the eyes diverge in upgaze. &#173;These patients appear to have overacting inferior oblique muscles, but the deviation is thought to be due to anomalous innervation of the lateral rectus muscles in upgaze. Clinical characteristics that help identify this form of strabismus include the following: the overelevation is not seen when the eyes are moved directly horizontally, but it becomes manifest when the eyes are directed horizontally and slightly into upgaze; &#173;there is no fundus torsion; &#173;there is no difference in vertical deviation with head tilts; and &#173;there is no superior oblique muscle underaction.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single">Kushner BJ. Pseudo inferior oblique overaction associated with Y and V patterns. <span class="italic">Ophthal&#173;mology.</span> 1991;98(10):1500–1505.</p>
			<p class="h2">X Pattern</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In X-&#173;pattern strabismus, an exodeviation is pres&#173;ent in primary position and increases in both upgaze and downgaze. This pattern is usually associated with overelevation and overdepression in adduction when the eye moves slightly above or below direct side gaze. X patterns are most commonly seen in patients with large-&#173;angle exotropia.</p>
			<p class="h2"><span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-2"></span> Pattern</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This rare pattern is a variant of A-&#173;pattern exotropia. In <span class="greek--tx-"></span>-&#173;pattern strabismus, the horizontal deviation is the same in primary position and upgaze but increases in downgaze. The <span class="greek--tx-"></span> pattern is usually associated with ODAd.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Management</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinically significant patterns (see the section Clinical Features and Identification of Pattern Strabismus) are typically treated surgically, in combination with correction of the under&#173;lying horizontal deviation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Surgical Correction of Pattern Deviations: General Princi&#173;ples</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following are strategies for surgical correction of pattern deviations. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span> for further discussion of some of the procedures and concepts mentioned &#173;here.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">For pattern strabismus associated with apparent overaction of the oblique muscles (OEAd, ODAd), weakening of the oblique muscles is performed.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">For patients with no apparent overaction of the oblique muscles or a pattern inconsistent with oblique dysfunction, vertical transposition of the horizontal muscles is performed. The muscles are transposed from one-&#173;half to a full tendon width. The medial rectus muscles are always moved &#173;toward the “apex” of the pattern (ie, upward in A patterns and downward in V patterns). The lateral rectus muscles are moved &#173;toward the open end (ie, upward in V patterns and downward in A patterns). A useful mnemonic is MALE: <span class="italic">m</span>edial rectus muscle to the <span class="italic">a</span>pex, <span class="italic">l</span>ateral rectus muscle to the <span class="italic">e</span>mpty space. &#173;These rules apply &#173;whether the horizontal rectus muscles are weakened or tightened (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-4</span>).<p class="bullet-list-cont _idGenParaOverride-1">If transposition of horizontal rectus muscles is used to treat pattern strabismus when &#173;there is associated ocular torsion, it &#173;will exacerbate the torsion (extorsion with V pattern and intorsion with A pattern), which itself can contribute to the pattern. Conversely, when rectus muscle transposition is used to treat torsion, it &#173;will make any associated pattern strabismus worse.</p></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">When horizontal rectus muscle recession-&#173;resection surgery is the preferred choice &#173;because of other pertinent &#173;factors (eg, prior surgery, unimprovable vision in 1 eye), displacement of the rectus muscle insertions should be in mutually opposite directions, according to the rules stated previously. Unlike what occurs when both horizontal rectus muscles of an eye are moved in the same direction, this displacement has &#173;little, if any, vertical effect in the primary position. This procedure should be used with caution in patients with binocular fusion as it can produce symptomatic torsion.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Some surgeons adjust the amount of horizontal surgery &#173;because of the potential effect of oblique muscle weakening on the horizontal deviation, particularly for superior oblique muscle surgery, but this is controversial. Some believe that bilateral superior oblique weakening &#173;causes a change of 10<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>–15<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span> &#173;toward convergence in primary position and suggest modifying the amount of horizontal surgery to compensate for this expected change. For inferior oblique muscle weakening procedures, the amount of horizontal rectus muscle surgery does not need to be altered, &#173;because the inferior oblique muscle weakening does not substantially change primary position alignment.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">Surgery on the vertical rectus muscles (eg, temporal displacement of the superior rectus muscles for A-&#173;pattern esotropia or temporal displacement of the inferior rectus muscles for V-&#173;pattern esotropia) is rarely used &#173;because transposition of the horizontal rectus muscles that are being operated on for the under&#173;lying esotropia or exotropia is usually sufficient.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Surgical Treatment of Specific Patterns</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;10-1</span> summarizes the surgical treatment of pattern strabismus (see also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">V pattern</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For V-&#173;pattern esotropia or exotropia associated with OEAd, weakening of the inferior oblique muscles is performed. For patients who also have dissociated vertical deviation (DVD; see Chapter&#160;11), anterior transposition of the inferior oblique muscle may improve both the V pattern and the DVD. &#173;Because patients with V-&#173;pattern infantile esotropia who are younger than 2&#160;years are at risk of developing DVD, anterior transposition of the inferior oblique may be considered preemptively for this group.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For patients with V-&#173;pattern esotropia or exotropia not associated with OEAd, appropriate vertical transposition of the horizontal rectus muscles is performed (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">A pattern</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For A-&#173;pattern exotropia or esotropia associated with ODAd, weakening of the superior oblique muscles is performed. Tenotomy of the posterior 7/8 of the insertions is an effective method for treating up to 20<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span> of A pattern, without a significant effect on torsion. Lengthening of the oblique tendon by recession, insertion of a spacer, or a split-&#173;tendon lengthening procedure may also be used to weaken the superior oblique muscles. Bilateral superior oblique tenotomy is a very power&#173;ful procedure that may correct up to 40<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>–50<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span> of A pattern. &#173;There is a risk of induced torsion with this procedure, which may be symptomatic for patients with binocular fusion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For patients with A-&#173;pattern exotropia or esotropia not associated with ODAd, appropriate vertical transposition of the horizontal rectus muscles is performed (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Y pattern</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because Y patterns are not due to overaction of the inferior oblique muscles, weakening &#173;these muscles is not an effective treatment. Superior transposition of the lateral rectus muscles can improve this pattern but does not eliminate it.</p>
			<p class="h3">X pattern</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">X patterns are usually due to pseudo-&#173;overaction of the oblique muscles, which is caused by contracture of the lateral rectus muscles in large-&#173;angle exotropia. Recession of the lateral rectus muscles alone usually improves the pattern.</p>
			<p class="h3"><span class="CharOverride-3">λ</span> pattern</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As stated earlier, &#173;these patterns are typically associated with ODAd. Appropriate superior oblique weakening procedures may be used in patients with this pattern.</p>
