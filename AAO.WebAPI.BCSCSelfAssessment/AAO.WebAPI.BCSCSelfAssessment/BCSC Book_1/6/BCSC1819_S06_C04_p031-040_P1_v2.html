			<p class="h2-h1">Ocular Rotations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">While &#173;there are several coordinate systems that are useful for mathematical modeling of rotations of the eye, ocular rotations are clinically considered as <span class="italic">horizontal rotations</span> about a vertical axis, corresponding to medial and lateral gaze; <span class="italic">vertical rotations</span> about a horizontal axis, corresponding to upward and downward gaze; and <span class="italic">torsional rotations</span> about the line of sight. If a change in gaze position is broken down into a series of separate rotations about the horizontal and vertical axes, the final torsion of the eye for a given gaze direction could theoretically vary, depending on the sequence in which the rotations are applied. In practice, the final torsion of the eye is always the same for a given gaze direction, regardless of the sequence by which it arrives &#173;there <span class="italic">(Donder’s law). Listing’s law</span> specifies this relationship by stipulating that the orientation in a given gaze position is equivalent to that which would result from a single rotation around an axis lying in <span class="italic">Listing’s plane</span>.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Positions of Gaze</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Primary position</span> is the position of the eyes when they are fixating straight ahead.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Secondary diagnostic positions</span> are straight up, straight down, right gaze, and left gaze.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Tertiary diagnostic positions</span> are the 4 oblique positions of gaze: up and right, up and left, down and right, down and left, as well as the right and left head-&#173;tilt positions.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">Cardinal positions,</span> which correspond to the primary fields of action of the extraocular muscles (EOMs) (see the section “Field of action”), are up and right, up and left, right, left, down and right, down and left (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-1</span>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See Chapter&#160;7 for additional discussion of the positions of gaze.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Extraocular Muscle Action</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The width of the insertion of each EOM serves to stabilize the eye and mitigate changes in action that would other&#173;wise occur in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent eye positions. For example, when the eye looks upward, the insertion of the medial rectus muscle also shifts upward. But this also tightens the inferior fibers and slackens the superior fibers, in effect shifting the net vector from the muscle downward &#173;toward its original position. See also Activity 3-1&#160;in Chapter&#160;3.</p>
			<p class="h3">Muscle pulleys</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Regardless of eye position or &#173;whether the insertion points have been moved surgically, the rectus muscles are still constrained to pass through the same openings in the Tenon capsule as they course from the orbital apex to the eye. The orbital connective tissue sheaths surrounding &#173;these openings have been described as muscle pulleys and have a specialized structure, including smooth muscle, that may provide active modulation of muscle action. See Chapter&#160;3 for further discussion of muscle pulleys.</p>
			<p class="h3">Arc of contact</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In primary position, each muscle wraps around the globe for several millimeters before reaching its insertion on the sclera. The length of muscle in contact with the globe is called the <span class="italic">arc of contact</span> (see Chapter&#160;3, &#173;Table&#160;3-1, which gives the arc of contact for the EOMs). The point where the muscle first contacts the globe is the effective insertion of the muscle. As the muscle contracts and the eye rotates &#173;toward the muscle, the effective insertion moves forward &#173;on the globe, toward the scleral insertion point, as the arc of contact decreases. The muscle remains tangential to the globe at its effective insertion, maintaining the same torque through much of the eye movement.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Eye Movements</p>
					<div id="Chapt4_Top2"> 
			<p class="h2-h1">Motor Units</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An individual motor nerve fiber and its several muscle fibers constitute a motor unit. The electrical activity of motor units can be recorded by <span class="italic">electromyography (EMG).</span> An electromyogram is a useful research tool in the investigation of normal and abnormal innervation of eye muscles. A portable EMG device connected to an insulated needle is often used during injection of botulinum toxin into eye muscles to help the surgeon localize the appropriate muscle within the orbit, especially when the muscle has been operated on previously.</p>
			<p class="h3">Recruitment during fixation or following movement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Recruitment</span> is the orderly increase in the number of activated motor units, thus increasing the strength of muscle contraction. For example, as the eye moves farther into abduction, more and more lateral rectus motor units are activated and brought into play by the brain to help pull the eye temporally. In addition, as the eye fixates farther into abduction, the firing frequency of each motor unit increases &#173;until it reaches a peak (several hundred per second, for some motor units).</p>
			<p class="h2">Monocular Eye Movements</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Ductions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ductions are monocular rotations of the eye. <span class="italic">Adduction</span> is movement of the eye nasally; <span class="italic">abduction</span> is movement of the eye temporally. <span class="italic">Elevation</span> (<span class="italic">supraduction</span> or <span class="italic">sursumduction</span>) is an upward rotation of the eye; <span class="italic">depression</span> (<span class="italic">infraduction</span> or <span class="italic">deorsumduction</span>) is a downward rotation of the eye. <span class="italic">Intorsion (incycloduction)</span> is defined as a nasal rotation of the superior pole of the vertical meridian. <span class="italic">Extorsion (excycloduction)</span> is a temporal rotation of the superior pole of the vertical meridian.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following are impor&#173;tant terms relating to the muscles used in monocular eye movements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">agonist:</span> the primary muscle moving the eye in a given direction</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">synergist:</span> the muscle in the same eye as the agonist that acts with the agonist to produce a given movement (eg, the inferior oblique muscle is a synergist with the agonist superior rectus muscle for elevation of the eye)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">antagonist:</span> the muscle in the same eye as the agonist that acts in the direction opposite to that of the agonist (eg, the medial rectus and lateral rectus muscles are antagonists)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Sherrington’s law of reciprocal innervation</span> states that increased innervation of a given EOM is accompanied by a reciprocal decrease in innervation of its antagonist. For example, as the right eye abducts, innervation of the right lateral rectus muscle increases and innervation of the right medial rectus muscle decreases.</p>
			<p class="h3">Field of action</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Field of action</span> refers to the gaze position (one of the cardinal positions) in which the effect of the EOM is most readily observed. For the lateral rectus muscle, the direction of rotation and the position of gaze are both abduction; for the medial rectus muscle, they are both adduction. However, the direction of rotation and the gaze position are not the same for the vertical muscles. For example, the inferior oblique muscle, acting alone, is an abductor and elevator, pulling the eye up and out—&#173;but its elevating action is best observed in adduction. Similarly, the superior oblique muscle, acting alone, is an abductor and depressor, pulling the eye down and out—&#173;but its depressing action is best observed in adduction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical significance of fields of action is that a deviation (strabismus) that increases with gaze in some directions may result from weakness of the muscle normally pulling the eye in that direction, from restriction of its action by its antagonist muscle, or from a combination of &#173;these 2 &#173;factors.</p>
			<p class="h3">Primary, secondary, and tertiary actions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With the eye in primary position, the medial and lateral rectus muscles move the eye only horizontally and therefore have a primary horizontal action. Anatomical studies have shown compartmentalization of the innervation to the horizontal rectus muscles in some patients; this may explain the finding of small vertical actions of &#173;these muscles in &#173;these cases (see Chapter&#160;3). The vertical rectus muscles have a direction of pull that is mostly vertical as their primary action, but in primary position, the &#173;angle of pull from origin to insertion is inclined 23° to the visual axis (or midplane of the eye), giving rise to a <span class="italic">torsional</span> effect as well. Intorsion is the secondary action of the superior rectus, and extorsion is the secondary action of the inferior rectus; &#173;because the net positions of the insertions are medial to the center of rotation of the eye, adduction is the tertiary action of both muscles. &#173;Because the oblique muscles are inclined 51° to the visual axis, torsion is their primary action, vertical rotation (depression/elevation) is their secondary action, and abduction is their tertiary action. The levator palpebrae superioris is also an EOM, and its sole action is elevation of the upper eyelid. See <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;4-1</span> for a summary of the EOM actions.</p>
			<p class="h3">Changing muscle action with dif&#173;fer&#173;ent gaze positions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The gaze position can alter the effect of EOM contractions on the rotation of the eye. In each of the cardinal positions, each of the 6 oculorotatory EOMs has dif&#173;fer&#173;ent effects on the eye’s rotation, based on the relationship between the visual axis of the eye and the orientation of the muscle plane to the visual axis. In each cardinal position, the &#173;angle between the visual axis and the direction of pull of the muscle being tested is minimized, thus maximizing the horizontal effect of the medial or lateral rectus or the vertical effect of the superior rectus, inferior rectus, superior oblique, or inferior oblique. By having the patient move the eyes to the 6 cardinal positions, the clinician can isolate and evaluate the ability of each of the 6 oculorotatory EOMs to move the eye. See also the section Binocular Eye Movements.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With the eye in primary position, the horizontal rectus muscles share a common horizontal plane that contains the visual axis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-2</span>). The clinician can assess the relative strength of the horizontal rectus muscles by observing the horizontal excursion of the eye as it moves medially from primary position to test the medial rectus and laterally to test the lateral rectus. The actions of the vertical rectus and oblique muscles are more complex.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With insertions anterior to the center of rotation of the globe and, in primary position, the 23° &#173;angle between the muscle planes and the visual axis (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 4-3, 4-4</span>), the superior and inferior rectus muscles have 3 actions: primary vertical, secondary torsion, and tertiary adduction. The relative vertical strength of the vertical rectus muscles can be most readily observed by aligning the visual axis parallel to the muscle plane axis—&#173;that is, when the eye is rotated 23° into abduction. In this position, the superior rectus becomes a pure elevator and the inferior rectus a pure depressor. To minimize the vertical action of &#173;these muscles, the visual axis should be perpendicular to the muscle axis at a position of 67° of adduction. In this position, the superior rectus action would be pure intorsion, and the inferior rectus action would be pure extorsion. &#173;Because the globe cannot adduct this far, the vertical rectus muscles maintain significant elevating and depressing action even in maximal voluntary adduction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With insertions posterior to the center of rotation of the globe and, in primary position, the 51° &#173;angle between the muscle planes and the visual axis (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 4-5, 4-6</span>), the superior and inferior oblique muscles have 3 actions: primary torsion, secondary vertical, and tertiary abduction. In 51° adduction, the muscle plane is aligned with the visual axis, and the vertical action of the oblique muscle can be most readily observed. When the eye abducts 39°, the visual axis becomes perpendicular to the muscle plane, and the muscle action is mainly torsion.</p>
			<p class="h2">Binocular Eye Movements</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When binocular eye movements are conjugate and the eyes move in the same direction, such movements are called <span class="italic">versions.</span> When the eye movements are dysconjugate and the eyes move in opposite directions, such movements are known as <span class="italic">vergences</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3">Versions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Right gaze <span class="italic">(dextroversion)</span> is movement of both eyes to the patient’s right. Left gaze <span class="italic">(levo&#173;version)</span> is movement of both eyes to the patient’s left. <span class="italic">Elevation,</span> or <span class="italic">upgaze (sursumversion),</span> is an upward rotation of both eyes. <span class="italic">Depression,</span> or <span class="italic">downgaze (deorsumversion),</span> is a downward rotation of both eyes. <span class="italic">Dextrocycloversion</span> is rotation of the superior pole of the vertical meridian of both eyes to the patient’s right. Similarly, <span class="italic">levocycloversion</span> is movement of both eyes so that the superior pole of the vertical meridian rotates to the patient’s left.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The term <span class="italic">yoke muscles</span> is used to describe 2 muscles (1&#160;in each eye) that are the prime movers of their respective eyes into a given position of gaze. For example, when the eyes move into right gaze, the right lateral rectus muscle and the left medial rectus muscle are si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously innervated and contracted. &#173;These muscles are said to be “yoked” together. Each EOM in one eye has a yoke muscle in the other eye. See Figure&#160;4-1, which shows the 6 cardinal positions of gaze and the yoke muscles whose primary actions are in &#173;those fields of gaze.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Hering’s law of motor correspondence</span> states that when the eyes move into a gaze direction, &#173;there is a simultaneous and equal increase in innervation to the yoke muscles for that direction. Hering’s law has impor&#173;tant clinical implications when the practitioner is evaluating a paralytic or restrictive strabismus. &#173;Because the amount of innervation supplied to both eyes is always determined by the fixating eye, the &#173;angle of deviation varies according to which eye is fixating. When the sound eye is fixating (prism over the affected eye when the prism alternate cover test is performed), the amount of misalignment is called the <span class="italic">primary deviation.</span> When the affected eye is fixating (prism over the sound eye when the prism alternate cover test is performed), the amount of misalignment is called the <span class="italic">secondary deviation.</span> The secondary deviation is larger than the primary deviation &#173;because of the increased innervation necessary to move the affected eye to the position of fixation. This extra innervation is shared by the yoke muscle in the sound eye, which &#173;causes excessive action of that muscle and a larger &#173;angle of deviation.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Vergences</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Convergence</span> is movement of both eyes nasally relative to a given starting position; <span class="italic">divergence</span> is movement of both eyes temporally relative to a given starting position. The medial rectus muscles are yoke muscles for convergence, and the lateral rectus muscles are yoked for divergence. With <span class="italic">vertical vergence</span> movements, one eye moves upward, and the other moves downward. <span class="italic">Incyclovergence</span> is a rotation of both eyes such that the superior pole of the vertical meridian is rotated nasally; <span class="italic">excyclovergence</span> is a rotation of both eyes such that the superior pole of the vertical meridian rotates temporally. Vergence movements are described in the following sections; see <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;4-2</span> for a classification of &#173;these movements.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-4"><span class="h4-head">Accommodative convergence of the visual axes</span> Part of the near reflex (also called <span class="italic">near synkinesis, near triad</span>), which consists of accommodation, convergence, and miosis. A certain amount of accommodative convergence (AC) occurs with each diopter of accommodation (A), giving the <span class="italic">accommodative convergence/accommodation (AC/A) ratio.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Abnormalities of this ratio are common and are impor&#173;tant &#173;causes of strabismus (see Chapter&#160;8). With an abnormally high AC/A ratio, the excess convergence tends to produce esotropia during near fixation that is greater than esotropia at distance. An abnormally low AC/A ratio tends to make the eyes less esotropic, or even exotropic, when the patient looks at near targets. Techniques for mea&#173;sur&#173;ing this ratio are discussed in Chapter&#160;7 &#173;under Convergence.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-4"><span class="h4-head">Fusional convergence</span> A movement to converge and position the eyes so that similar ret&#173;i&#173;nal images proj&#173;ect on corresponding ret&#173;i&#173;nal areas. Fusional convergence is activated when a target in the midline is seen with bitemporal ret&#173;i&#173;nal image disparity. See also Chapter&#160;5.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-4"><span class="h4-head">Proximal (instrument) convergence</span> An induced convergence movement caused by a psychological awareness that the object of fixation is near. This movement is particularly apparent when a person looks through an instrument such as a binocular microscope.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Tonic convergence</span> The constant innervational tone to the EOMs when a person is awake and alert. &#173;Because of the anatomical shape of the bony orbits and the position of the rectus muscle origins, the position of the eyes during complete muscle paralysis is divergent. Therefore, convergence tone is normally necessary in the awake state for the eyes to be aligned. For example, an esotropic patient &#173;under general anesthesia may become less esotropic or even exotropic with suspension of tonic convergence.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Voluntary convergence</span> A conscious application of the near reflex.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Fusional divergence</span> A movement to diverge and position the eyes so that similar ret&#173;i&#173;nal images proj&#173;ect on corresponding ret&#173;i&#173;nal areas. Fusional divergence is activated when a target in the midline is seen with binasal ret&#173;i&#173;nal image disparity. See also Chapter&#160;5.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Fusional vertical vergence</span> A superior movement of one eye and inferior movement of the other to reduce vertical disparity so that similar ret&#173;i&#173;nal images proj&#173;ect on corresponding ret&#173;i&#173;nal areas.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Fusional cyclovergence</span> Intorsion of both eyes (incyclovergence) or extorsion of both eyes (excyclovergence) to reduce torsional disparity so that similar ret&#173;i&#173;nal images proj&#173;ect on corresponding ret&#173;i&#173;nal areas. While it can be enhanced by special training, cyclovergence is normally very limited, and fusion of torsional disparity is mostly accomplished by sensory adaptation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Supranuclear Control Systems for Eye Movement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eye movements are directed and coordinated by several supranuclear systems. The <span class="italic">saccadic system</span> generates fast (up to 400°–500° per second) eye movements, such as eye movements of refixation. This system functions to place the image of an object of interest on the fovea or to shift gaze from one object to another. Saccadic movements require a sudden strong pulse of force from the EOMs to move the eye rapidly against the viscosity produced by the fatty tissue and the fascia in which the globe lies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">smooth-&#173;pursuit system</span> generates following, or pursuit, eye movements that maintain the image of a moving object on the fovea. Pursuit latency is shorter than saccade latency, but the maximum peak velocity of &#173;these slow pursuit movements is limited to 30°–60° per second. The involuntary <span class="italic">optokinetic system</span> utilizes smooth pursuit to track a moving object and then introduces a compensatory saccade to refixate. Tests of this system, performed with an optokinetic stimulus, are often used to detect visual responses in an infant or child with apparent vision loss, such as with ocular motor apraxia (see Chapter&#160;12). The <span class="italic">vergence system</span> controls dysconjugate eye movement, as in convergence or divergence. Supranuclear control of vergence eye movements is not yet fully understood. &#173;There are also systems that integrate eye movements with body movements in order to stabilize the image on the ret&#173;i&#173;nas. The most clinically impor&#173;tant of &#173;these systems is the <span class="italic">vestibular-&#173;ocular system.</span> Vestibular-&#173;ocular reflex responses are driven by the labyrinth, which involves the semicircular canals and otoliths (utricle and saccule) of the inner ears. The cervical, or neck, receptors also provide input for this reflex control. See BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for in-&#173;depth discussion of &#173;these systems.</p>
