			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Normal Growth and Development</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The &#173;human eye undergoes dramatic anatomical and physiologic development throughout infancy and early childhood (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;15-1</span>). Ophthalmologists caring for pediatric patients should be familiar with the normal growth and development of the child’s eye &#173;because departures from the norm may indicate pathology. See also BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Dimensions of the Eye</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most of the growth of the eye takes place in the first year of life. Change in the eye’s axial length occurs in 3 phases. The first phase (birth to age 2&#160;years) is a period of rapid growth: the axial length increases by approximately 4&#160;mm in the first 6 months of life and by an additional 2&#160;mm during the next 6 months. During the second (age 2 to 5&#160;years) and third (age 5 to 13&#160;years) phases, growth slows, with axial length increasing by about 1&#160;mm per phase.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Similarly, with growth of the globe, the corneal dia&#173;meter increases rapidly during the first year of life. The average horizontal dia&#173;meter of the cornea is 9.5–10.5&#160;mm in newborns and increases to 12.0&#160;mm in adults. The cornea also flattens in the first year such that keratometry values change markedly, from approximately 52.00 diopters (D) at birth, to 46.00 D by age 6 months, to adult mea&#173;sure&#173;ments of 42.00–44.00 D by age 12 months. Mild corneal clouding may be seen in healthy newborns and is common in premature infants. It resolves as the cornea gradually becomes thinner, decreasing from an average central thickness of 691 <span class="symbol CharOverride-1">μ</span>m at 30–32 weeks’ gestation to 564 <span class="symbol CharOverride-1">μ</span>m at birth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The power of the pediatric lens decreases dramatically over the first several years of life—an impor&#173;tant consideration when intraocular lens implantation is planned for infants and young &#173;children &#173;after cataract extraction. Lens power decreases from approximately 35.00 D at birth to about 23.00 D at age 2&#160;years. Subsequently, the change is more gradual: lens power decreases to approximately 19.00 D by age 11&#160;years, with &#173;little or no change thereafter.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Refractive State</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The refractive state of the eye changes as the eye’s axial length increases and the cornea and lens flatten. In general, eyes are hyperopic at birth, become slightly more hyperopic &#173;until approximately age 7&#160;years, and then experience a myopic shift &#173;until reaching adult dimensions, usually by about age 16&#160;years (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-1</span>). <span class="italic">Emmetropization</span> in the developing eye refers to the combination of changes in the refractive power of the anterior segment and in axial length that drive the eye toward emmetropia. The reduction in astigmatism that occurs in many infant eyes and the decreasing hyperopia that occurs &#173;after age 6–8&#160;years are examples of emmetropization.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Race, ethnicity, and heredity play a role in the risk of par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar types of refractive error. For example, myopia is more common among African American &#173;children compared with Hispanic &#173;children and non-&#173;Hispanic white &#173;children. Hyperopia is more common among non-&#173;Hispanic white &#173;children compared with African American and Hispanic &#173;children. Astigmatism is more common among Hispanic &#173;children and African American &#173;children than non-&#173;Hispanic white &#173;children.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Myopia is increasingly prevalent worldwide, and it is estimated that by 2050, 50% of the world population &#173;will be myopic. If myopia develops before age 10&#160;years, &#173;there is a higher risk of eventual progression to myopia of 6.00 D or more. The etiology of increased myopia prevalence is unclear, but urbanization, increased near work, and decreased exposure to ultraviolet light are suggested influences. Low-&#173;dose (0.01%) atropine has been shown to significantly decrease myopic progression in Asian &#173;children.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Orbit and Ocular Adnexa</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">During infancy and childhood, orbital volume increases, and the orbital opening becomes less circular, resembling a horizontal oval. The lacrimal fossa becomes more superficial and the &#173;angle formed by the axes of the 2 orbits less divergent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The palpebral fissure mea&#173;sures approximately 18&#160;mm horizontally and 8&#160;mm vertically at birth. Growth of the palpebral fissure is greater horizontally than vertically, resulting in the eyelid opening becoming less round and acquiring its elliptical adult shape. Most of the horizontal growth occurs in the first 2&#160;years of life (see Chapter&#160;17, Fig 17-1).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Cornea, Iris, Pupil, and Anterior Chamber</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Central corneal thickness (CCT) decreases during the first 6–12 months of life (see the section Dimensions of the Eye). It then increases from approximately 553 <span class="symbol CharOverride-1">μ</span>m at age 1 year to about 573 <span class="symbol CharOverride-1">μ</span>m by age 12&#160;years and stabilizes thereafter. CCT is similar in white and Hispanic &#173;children, whereas African American &#173;children tend to have thinner corneas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most changes in iris color occur over the first 6–12 months of life, as pigment accumulates in the iris stroma and melanocytes. Compared with the adult pupil, the infant pupil is relatively small. A pupil dia&#173;meter less than 1.8&#160;mm or greater than 5.4&#160;mm is suggestive of an abnormality. The pupillary light reflex is normally pres&#173;ent &#173;after 31 weeks’ gestational age. At birth, the iris insertion is near the level of the scleral spur, but during the first year of life, the lens and ciliary body migrate posteriorly, resulting in formation of the &#173;angle recess.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Intraocular Pressure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of intraocular pressure (IOP) in infants can be difficult; results may vary depending on the method used and may not accurately represent the &#173;actual IOP. Nevertheless, normal IOP is lower in infants than in adults, and a pressure higher than 21&#160;mm Hg should be considered abnormal. CCT influences the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of IOP, but this effect is not well understood in &#173;children. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;22</span> in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Extraocular Muscles</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The rectus muscles of infants are smaller than &#173;those of adults; muscle insertions, on average, are 2.3–3.0&#160;mm narrower, and the tendons are thinner in infants than in adults. In newborns, the distance from the rectus muscle insertion to the limbus is roughly 2&#160;mm less than that in adults; by age 6 months, this distance is 1&#160;mm less; and at 20 months, it is similar to that in adults.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Extraocular muscle function continues to develop &#173;after birth. Eye movements driven by the vestibular-&#173;ocular system are pres&#173;ent as early as 34 weeks’ gestational age. Conjugate horizontal gaze is pres&#173;ent at birth, but vertical gaze may not be fully functional &#173;until 6 months of age. Intermittent strabismus occurs in approximately two-&#173;thirds of young infants but resolves in most by 2–3 months of age. Accommodation and fusional convergence are usually pres&#173;ent by age 3 months.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ret&#173;i&#173;na</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The macula is poorly developed at birth but changes rapidly during the first 4&#160;years of life. Most significant are changes in macular pigmentation, development of the annular ring and foveal light reflex, and differentiation of cone photoreceptors. Improvement in visual acuity with age is due in part to development of the macula, specifically, differentiation of cone photoreceptors, narrowing of the rod-&#173;free zone, and an increase in foveal cone density (see Chapter&#160;5). Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascularization begins at the optic disc at 16 weeks’ gestational age and proceeds to the peripheral ret&#173;ina, reaching the temporal ora serrata by 40&#160;weeks’ gestational age.</p>

			<p class="h2">Visual Acuity and Stereoacuity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Visual acuity improvement in infancy and early childhood is attributable to neural development as well as ocular structural changes (see Chapter&#160;16).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Two major methods are used to quantitate visual acuity in preverbal infants and toddlers: <span class="italic">preferential looking (PL)</span> and <span class="italic">visual evoked potential (VEP).</span> See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span> for a description of &#173;these methods. VEP studies show that visual acuity improves from approximately 20/400&#160;in newborns to 20/20 by age 6–7 months. However, PL studies estimate the visual acuity of a newborn to be 20/600, improving to 20/120 by age 3 months and to 20/60 by 6 months. Further, PL testing shows that visual acuity of 20/20 is not reached &#173;until age 3–5&#160;years. The discrepancy between mea&#173;sure&#173;ments obtained by &#173;these 2 methods may be related to the higher cortical pro&#173;cessing required for PL compared with VEP. Stereo&#173;acuity reaches 60 seconds of arc by about age 5–6 months (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7</span>).</p>

			<p class="h1">Abnormal Growth and Development</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Major congenital anomalies occur in 2%–3% of live births. &#173;Causes include chromosomal abnormalities, multifactorial disorders, and environmental agents, but many cases are idiopathic. Regardless of etiology, congenital anomalies may be categorized as shown in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;15-2</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">malformation</span> implies a morphologic defect pres&#173;ent from the onset of development or from a very early stage. A disturbance to a group of cells in a single developmental field may cause multiple malformations. Multiple etiologies may result in similar field defects and patterns of malformation. A single structural defect or &#173;factor can lead to a cascade, or domino effect, of secondary anomalies called a <span class="italic">sequence.</span> The Pierre Robin group of anomalies (cleft palate, glossoptosis, micrognathia, respiratory prob&#173;lems) may represent a sequence caused by underdevelopment of the mandible and is seen in disorders such as Stickler and fetal alcohol syndromes. A <span class="italic">syndrome</span> is a recognizable and consistent pattern of multiple malformations known to have a specific cause, which is usually a mutation of a single gene, a chromosome alteration, or an environmental agent. An <span class="italic">association</span> represents defects known to occur together in a statistically significant number of patients. An association may represent a variety of yet-&#173;unidentified &#173;causes. Two or more minor anomalies in combination significantly increase the likelihood of an associated major malformation.</p>
