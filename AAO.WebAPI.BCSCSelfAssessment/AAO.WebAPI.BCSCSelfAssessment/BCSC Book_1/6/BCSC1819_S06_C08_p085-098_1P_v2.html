			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An <span class="italic">esodeviation</span> is a latent or manifest convergent misalignment of the visual axes. Esodeviations are the most common type of childhood strabismus, accounting for more than 50% of ocular deviations in the pediatric population. In adults, esodeviations and exodeviations are equally prevalent.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Esodeviations occur with equal frequency in males and females and are more common in African Americans and white ethnic groups than in Asian ethnic groups in the United States. Risk &#173;factors for the development of esotropia include anisometropia, hyperopia, neurodevelopmental impairment, prematurity, low birth weight, craniofacial or chromosomal abnormalities, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and &#173;family history of strabismus. The prevalence of esotropia increases with age (higher prevalence at 48–72&#160;months compared with 6–11&#160;months), moderate anisometropia, and moderate hyperopia. In some families, a mendelian inheritance pattern has been observed. Amblyopia develops in approximately 50% of &#173;children who have esotropia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Esodeviations can result from innervational, anatomical, mechanical, refractive, or accommodative &#173;factors. &#173;There are several major types of esodeviations, and they can be classified as comitant or incomitant (<span class="xref-table">&#173;</span><span class="xref-table">Table&#160;8-1</span>).</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Pseudoesotropia</p>
					<div id="Chapt8_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Pseudoesotropia</span> refers to the appearance of esotropia when the visual axes are in fact aligned. The appearance may be caused by a flat and broad nasal bridge, prominent epicanthal folds, a narrow interpupillary distance, or a negative &#173;angle kappa (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7</span>). Less than the expected amount of sclera is seen nasally, creating the impression that the eye is deviated inward (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-1</span>). This is especially noticeable when the child gazes to &#173;either side. &#173;Because no real deviation exists, results of both corneal light reflex testing and cover testing are normal.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Infantile (Congenital) Esotropia</p>
					<div id="Chapt8_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Infantile esotropia</span> is defined as an esotropia that is pres&#173;ent by 6 months of age. Some ophthalmologists refer to this disorder as <span class="italic">congenital esotropia,</span> although the deviation is usually not manifest at birth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Variable, transient, intermittent strabismus is commonly noted in the first 2–3&#160;months of life. Also, it is common to see both intermittent esotropia and exotropia in the same infant (termed <span class="italic">ocular instability of infancy</span>). This condition should resolve by 3&#160;months of age but sometimes persists, especially in premature infants. If an esotropia is pres&#173;ent &#173;after age 2 months, is constant, and mea&#173;sures 30 prism diopters (<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>) or more, it is unlikely to resolve and &#173;will prob&#173;ably require surgical intervention.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with infantile esotropia often have a &#173;family history of esotropia or other strabismus, but well-&#173;defined ge&#173;ne&#173;tic patterns are unusual. Infantile esotropia occurs more frequently in &#173;children born prematurely and in up to 30% of &#173;children with neurologic and developmental prob&#173;lems, including ce&#173;re&#173;bral palsy and hydrocephalus. Infantile esotropia has been associated with an increased risk of development of &#173;mental illness by early adulthood (2.6&#160;times higher in patients with infantile esotropia than in controls).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Pathogenesis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cause of infantile esotropia remains unknown. The debate regarding its etiology has focused on the implications of 2 conflicting theories. The Worth “sensory” concept proposes that infantile esotropia results from a congenital deficit in a “fusion center” in the brain. According to this theory, the goal of restoring binocularity is futile. In contrast, the Chavasse theory proposes that the primary prob&#173;lem in infantile esotropia is one of motor development, which is potentially curable if ocular alignment is achieved in infancy. Several authors have reported favorable sensory results in infants operated on between 6&#160;months and 2&#160;years of age, and &#173;these encouraging results have become the basis for the practice of early surgery for infantile esotropia.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Clinical Features and Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The eyes may have equal vision, in which case alternate fixation or cross-&#173;fixation &#173;will be&#160;pres&#173;ent. Cross-&#173;fixation, the use of the adducted eye for fixation of objects in the contralateral visual field, is associated with large-&#173;angle esotropias (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-2</span>). Amblyopia is, however, commonly associated with infantile esotropia, and when it is pres&#173;ent, a fixation preference can be observed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Versions and ductions are often normal initially. The deviation is comitant and characteristically larger than 30<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>. Overelevation in adduction and dissociated strabismus complex develop in more than 50% of patients, usually &#173;after 1–2&#160;years of age. &#173;There may be an apparent abduction deficit &#173;because of cross-&#173;fixation; &#173;children with equal vision in both eyes have no need to abduct &#173;either eye on side gaze. If amblyopia is pres&#173;ent, the better-&#173;seeing eye &#173;will fixate in all fields of gaze, making the amblyopic eye appear to have an abduction deficit. The infant’s ability to abduct each eye can be demonstrated with the doll’s head maneuver or by observation &#173;after patching &#173;either of the patient’s eyes. The clinician can also hold the infant and spin in a circle, which stimulates the vestibular-&#173;ocular reflex and helps demonstrate full abduction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Asymmetry of monocular horizontal smooth pursuit is normal in infants up to age 6 months, with the nasal-&#173;to-&#173;temporal direction less well developed than the temporal-&#173;to-&#173;nasal. Patients with infantile esotropia, however, have per&#173;sis&#173;tent smooth-&#173;pursuit asymmetry throughout their lives. Fusion maldevelopment nystagmus syndrome (also known as <span class="italic">latent</span> and <span class="italic">manifest latent nystagmus</span>) is also a commonly associated motility anomaly. Cycloplegic refraction characteristically reveals low hyperopia (<span class="symbol">+</span>1.00 to <span class="symbol">+</span>2.00&#160;diopters [D]). Hyperopia greater than 2.00 D should prompt consideration of spectacle correction; reduction of the strabismic &#173;angle with glasses indicates the presence of an accommodative component.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A severe form of infantile esotropia, referred to as <span class="italic">Ciancia syndrome,</span> consists of large-&#173;angle esotropia (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>50<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>), abducting nystagmus, and mild abduction deficits. &#173;Children with this syndrome uniformly use cross-&#173;fixation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Significant hyperopic refractive error should be corrected by prescribing the full cycloplegic refraction. A small-&#173;angle esotropia that is variable in degree or intermittent may be more likely to respond to hyperopic correction than would a large-&#173;angle or constant esotropia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular alignment is rarely achieved without surgery in early-&#173;onset esotropia. Previously, it was thought that concurrent amblyopia should be fully treated before surgery. However, it has recently been shown that successful postoperative alignment is as likely to occur in patients with mild to moderate amblyopia at the time of surgery as it is in &#173;those whose amblyopia has been fully treated preoperatively. When ocular alignment is achieved earlier, &#173;there may be the added benefits of better fusion, stereopsis, and long-&#173;term stability.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The goal of surgical treatment of infantile esotropia is to reduce the deviation to orthotropia or as close to it as pos&#173;si&#173;ble. In the presence of normal vision, this ideally results in the development of some degree of sensory fusion. Alignment within 8<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>–10<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span> of orthotropia frequently results in the development of the monofixation syndrome, characterized by peripheral fusion, central suppression, and favorable appearance (see Chapter&#160;5). This small-&#173;angle strabismus generally represents a stable, functional surgical outcome even though bifoveal fusion is not achieved; it is therefore considered a successful surgical result. In addition, the child’s psychological and motor development may improve and accelerate &#173;after the eyes are straightened.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most ophthalmologists in North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca agree that surgery should be undertaken early. The belief is that the eyes should be aligned by 2&#160;years of age, preferably earlier, to optimize binocular cooperation. Surgery can be performed in healthy &#173;children as early as age 4 months. The Congenital Esotropia Observational Study showed that when patients pres&#173;ent with constant esotropia of at least 40<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span> &#173;after 10 weeks of age, the deviations are unlikely to resolve spontaneously. Smaller &#173;angles can be monitored, as they may improve spontaneously. A prospective, multicenter Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean study (ELISSS) comparing early (age 6–24 months) versus delayed (age 32–60 months) strabismus surgery showed a small improvement in gross binocularity in the early-&#173;surgery group; however, a higher number of procedures &#173;were performed in the early-&#173;surgery group.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vari&#173;ous surgical approaches have been suggested for infantile esotropia. The most commonly performed initial procedure is recession of both medial rectus muscles. Recession of a medial rectus muscle combined with resection of the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle is also effective. Two-&#173;muscle surgery spares the other horizontal rectus muscles for subsequent surgery should it be necessary, which is not uncommon. For infants with large deviations (typically <span class="symbol">&gt;</span>60<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>), some surgeons operate on 3 or even 4 horizontal rectus muscles at the time of the initial surgery, or they add botulinum toxin injection to the medial rectus muscle recession. Significant inferior oblique muscle overaction can be treated at the time of the initial surgery. <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span> discusses surgical procedures in detail.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Injection of botulinum toxin to the medial rectus muscles has also been used as primary treatment of infantile esotropia. In a recent study, botulinum toxin injection was associated with a substantially higher reoperation rate than was strabismus surgery, and &#173;children treated with botulinum toxin &#173;were found to have a higher rate of postoperative abnormal binocularity. Botulinum toxin may be most useful for smaller deviations.</p>

					<div id="Chapt8_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Accommodative esotropia</span> is defined as a convergent deviation of the eyes associated with activation of the accommodative reflex. All accommodative esodeviations are acquired and can be characterized as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-6">onset typically between 6 months and 7&#160;years of age, averaging 2½ years of age (can be as early as age 4 months)</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Types of accommodative esotropia are listed in &#173;<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;8-1</span> and discussed in the following sections.</p>
			<p class="h2">Pathogenesis and Types of Accommodative Esotropia</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Refractive accommodative esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The mechanism of refractive accommodative esotropia involves 3 &#173;factors: uncorrected hyperopia, accommodative convergence, and insufficient fusional divergence. &#173;Because of uncorrected hyperopia, the patient must accommodate to focus the ret&#173;i&#173;nal image. Accommodation is accompanied by the other components of the near reflex, namely convergence and miosis. If the patient’s fusional divergence mechanism is insufficient to compensate for the increased convergence tonus, esotropia results. The &#173;angle of esotropia is approximately the same at distance and near fixation and is generally between 20<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span> and 30<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>. Patients with refractive accommodative esotropia have an average of <span class="symbol">+</span>4.00 D of hyperopia.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">High AC/A ratio accommodative esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with a <span class="italic">high accommodative convergence/accommodation (AC/A) ratio</span> (see Chapter&#160;7) have an excessive convergence response for the amount of accommodation required to focus while wearing their full cycloplegic correction. In this form of esotropia, the deviation is pres&#173;ent only at near or is much larger at near.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The refractive error in high AC/A ratio accommodative esotropia (also called <span class="italic">nonrefractive accommodative esotropia</span>) averages <span class="symbol">+</span>2.25 D. However, this esotropia can occur in patients with a normal level of hyperopia or high hyperopia, with emmetropia, or even with myopia.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Partially accommodative esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with partially accommodative esotropia show reduction in the &#173;angle of esotropia when wearing glasses but have a residual esotropia despite provision of the full hyperopic correction. This is more likely to occur if &#173;there is a long delay in refractive correction. In some cases, partially accommodative esotropia results from decompensation of a pure refractive accommodative esotropia; in other instances, an initial nonaccommodative esotropia subsequently develops an accommodative component.</p>
			<p class="h2">Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The 2 eyes can have equal vision, or amblyopia can be pres&#173;ent. Versions and ductions may be normal, or overelevation in adduction or dissociated strabismus complex (discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span>) may be pres&#173;ent. The examiner should mea&#173;sure the deviation using an accommodative target at distance and at near. Alternate cover testing at the initial examination typically reveals an intermittent comitant esotropia that is larger at near than at distance.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Management</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Refractive accommodative esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of refractive accommodative esotropia consists of correction of the full amount of hyperopia, as determined &#173;under cycloplegia. If binocular fusion is maintained, the refractive correction can &#173;later be decreased to 1.00–2.00 D less than the full cycloplegic refraction. Amblyopia, if pres&#173;ent, may respond to spectacle correction alone, but treatment with occlusion or atropine may be necessary if the amblyopia persists &#173;after a period of spectacle wear (see Chapter&#160;6).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Parents must understand not only that full-&#173;time wear of the glasses is impor&#173;tant but also that the refractive correction can only help control the strabismus, not “cure” it. Once full-&#173;time wear has begun, the esotropia may increase when the child is not wearing glasses, &#173;because the child makes a strong accommodative effort to produce an image that is as clear as the one experienced with refractive correction. Discussing &#173;these issues with the parents at the time the prescription is given is helpful.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Strabismus surgery may be required when a patient with presumed refractive accommodative esotropia does not achieve an ocular alignment within the fusion range (up to 8<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>–10<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>) with correction (partially accommodative esotropia). Before proceeding with surgery, the ophthalmologist should recheck the cycloplegic refraction to rule out latent uncorrected hyperopia.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">High AC/A ratio accommodative esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A high AC/A ratio can be managed optically or surgically; it can also be observed.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Bifocals.</span> Plus lenses for hyperopia reduce accommodation and therefore accommodative convergence. Bifocal glasses further reduce or eliminate the need to accommodate for near fixation. If bifocals are used, the initial prescription should be for flat-&#173;top style bifocals (see the chapter on refraction in BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clini</span><span class="italic">cal Optics</span>) with the lowest plus power needed (up to <span class="symbol">+</span>3.00 D) to achieve ocular alignment at near fixation. To increase the likelihood that the child will use the bifocal segment, it should be set high enough that the top of the bifocal segment bisects the pupil. Progressive bifocal lenses have been used successfully in older &#173;children who know how to use bifocal glasses. An ideal response to bifocal glasses is restoration of normal binocular function (fusion and stereopsis) at both distance and near fixation. An acceptable response is fusion at distance and less than 10<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span> of residual esotropia at near with bifocals (signifying the potential for fusion). While some &#173;children improve spontaneously with time, &#173;others need to be slowly weaned from bifocal glasses. The pro&#173;cess of reducing the bifocal power in 0.50–1.00 D steps can be started at about age 7 or 8&#160;years and should be completed by age 10–12&#160;years. If a child cannot be weaned from bifocals, surgery may be considered.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Surgery.</span> Surgical management of high AC/A ratio accommodative esotropia is controversial. Some ophthalmologists advocate surgery (medial rectus muscle recessions with or without posterior or pulley fixation) to normalize the AC/A ratio, which may allow discontinuation of bifocals. The risk of overcorrection at distance is low (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>10%). Some ophthalmologists use prism adaptation, which entails using prisms preoperatively to neutralize a deviation for a certain length of time. The prism neutralization can then be used to predict the outcome of surgery and determine the maximum deviation.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">Observation.</span> Many patients show a decrease in the near deviation with time, and binocular vision at both distance and near fixation ultimately develops. Some ophthalmologists observe the near deviation as long as the distance alignment allows for the development of peripheral fusion.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">For the long-&#173;term management of both refractive and high AC/A ratio accommodative esotropia, it is impor&#173;tant to remember that hyperopia usually increases &#173;until age 5–7&#160;years before it starts to decrease. Therefore, if the esotropia with correction increases, the cycloplegic refraction should be repeated and the full correction prescribed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If glasses correct all or nearly all the esotropia and if some degree of sensory binocular cooperation or fusion is pres&#173;ent, the clinician may begin to reduce the hyperopic correction to create a small esophoria, which is thought to stimulate fusional divergence. An increase in the fusional divergence, combined with the natu&#173;ral decrease of both the hyperopia and the high AC/A ratio, may enable the patient to eventually maintain straight eyes without bifocals or glasses altogether.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Partially accommodative esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of partially accommodative esotropia consists of strabismus surgery for the deviation that persists while the patient wears the full hyperopic correction. It is impor&#173;tant that the patient and parents understand <span class="italic">before</span> surgery that its purpose is to produce straight eyes with spectacle wear—&#173;not to enable the child to discontinue wearing glasses altogether. In older patients, refractive surgery may be considered to both reduce the hyperopic refractive error and improve the ocular alignment.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Acquired Nonaccommodative Esotropia</p>
					<div id="Chapt8_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several types of comitant esotropia not associated with activation of the accommodative reflex may develop in &#173;later infancy (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>6 months), childhood, or even adulthood. The &#173;causes of &#173;these acquired nonaccommodative esotropias are varied.</p>
			<p class="h2">Basic Acquired Nonaccommodative Esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Basic acquired nonaccommodative esotropia is a comitant esotropia that develops &#173;after age 6 months and is not associated with an accommodative component. As in infantile esotropia, the amount of hyperopia is not significant, and the &#173;angle of deviation is similar when mea&#173;sured at distance and near. Acquired esotropia may be acute in onset. In such cases, the patient immediately becomes aware of the deviation and may have diplopia. A careful evaluation is impor&#173;tant to rule out an accommodative or paretic component. Temporary but prolonged disruption of binocular vision—&#173;such as may result from a hyphema, preseptal cellulitis, mechanical ptosis, or prolonged patching for amblyopia—is a known precipitating cause of acquired nonaccommodative esotropia. In patients with acquired nonaccommodative esotropia, fusion is thought to be tenuous, so this temporary disruption of binocular vision upsets the balance, resulting in esotropia. &#173;Because the onset of nonaccommodative esotropia in an older child may be a sign of an under&#173;lying neurologic disorder, neuroimaging and neurologic evaluation may be indicated, especially when other symptoms or signs of neurologic abnormality are pres&#173;ent, such as lateral incomitance, deviation greater at distance than near, abnormal head position, or concomitant headache.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many patients with acquired nonaccommodative esotropia have a history of normal binocular vision; thus, the prognosis for restoration of single binocular vision with prisms and/or surgery is good. Therapy consists of amblyopia treatment, if necessary, and surgical correction or botulinum toxin injection as soon as pos&#173;si&#173;ble &#173;after the onset of the deviation. The Prism Adaptation Study showed a smaller undercorrection rate (approximately 10% less) when the amount of surgery was based on the prism-&#173;adapted &#173;angle.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Cyclic Esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cyclic esotropia is a rare form of strabismus; other forms of cyclic strabismus occur but are even rarer. Onset of cyclic esotropia is typically during the preschool years. The esotropia is comitant and intermittent, usually occurring &#173;every other day (48-&#173;hour cycle). Variable intervals and 24-&#173;hour cycles have also been documented.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fusion and binocular vision are usually absent or defective on the strabismic day, with marked improvement or normalization on the orthotropic day. Occlusion therapy may convert the cyclic deviation into a constant one.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgical treatment of cyclic esotropia is usually effective. The amount of surgery is based on the maximum &#173;angle of deviation pres&#173;ent when the eyes are esotropic.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Sensory Esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Monocular vision loss (due to cataract, corneal clouding, optic nerve or ret&#173;i&#173;nal disorders, or vari&#173;ous other entities) may cause sensory (deprivation) esotropia. Conditions preventing clear and focused ret&#173;i&#173;nal images and symmetric visual stimulation must be identified and remedied promptly, if pos&#173;si&#173;ble, to prevent irreversible amblyopia. If surgery or botulinum toxin injection is indicated for strabismus, it is generally performed only on the eye with a significant vision deficit.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Divergence Insufficiency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In divergence insufficiency, the characteristic finding is an esodeviation that is greater at distance than at near. The deviation is horizontally comitant, and fusional divergence is reduced. &#173;There are 2 forms of divergence insufficiency: a primary, isolated form; and a secondary form that is rare and associated with neurologic abnormalities, including pontine tumors, increased intracranial pressure, or severe head trauma. In &#173;these secondary cases, the divergence insufficiency is prob&#173;ably due to a mild sixth nerve paresis. Patients with secondary divergence insufficiency require neuroimaging to rule out treatable intracranial lesions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Primary divergence insufficiency is an increasingly diagnosed type of adult strabismus. More recently termed <span class="italic">age-&#173;related distance esotropia,</span> the entity is a slowly progressing, benign condition that occurs predominantly in patients older than 50&#160;years. Affected individuals report a gradual onset of horizontal diplopia that is pres&#173;ent at distance but not at near. Imaging may demonstrate thinning, elongation, and rupture of the connective tissue between the lateral and superior rectus muscles and sagging and elongation of the lateral rectus muscles. Management consists of base-&#173;out prisms, botulinum toxin injection of the medial rectus muscles, and strabismus surgery. In patients with age-&#173;related distance esotropia, reestablishment of binocular fusion generally occurs following treatment.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Spasm of the Near Reflex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Spasm of the near reflex (also known as <span class="italic">ciliary spasm</span> or <span class="italic">convergence spasm</span>) is a spectrum of abnormalities of the near response. The etiology is generally thought to be functional, related to psychological &#173;factors such as stress and anxiety. In rare cases, it can be associated with organic disease. Patients pres&#173;ent with varying combinations of excessive convergence, increased accommodation, and miosis. Patients may pres&#173;ent with acute esotropia alternating with orthotropia. Substitution of a convergence movement for a gaze movement with horizontal versions is characteristic. Monocular abduction is normal despite marked limitation of abduction on version testing. Pseudomyopia may occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment consists of cycloplegic agents such as atropine or homatropine, hyperopic correction, and bifocal glasses. Counseling to address under&#173;lying psychological issues may be helpful. If the spasm cannot be broken, botulinum toxin injection of the medial rectus muscles and strabismus surgery may be considered with caution.</p>

			<p class="h2">Consecutive Esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Consecutive esotropia</span> refers to an esotropia that follows a history of exotropia<span class="italic">.</span> It can arise spontaneously, or it can develop &#173;after surgery for exotropia. Spontaneous consecutive esotropia is rare and almost always occurs in the setting of neurologic disorders or with very poor vision in 1 eye. Postsurgical consecutive esotropia, on the other hand, is not uncommon. Fortunately, it often resolves over time without treatment. In fact, an initial small overcorrection is desirable &#173;after surgery for exotropia, as it is associated with an improved long-&#173;term success rate. Treatment options for consecutive esotropia include base-&#173;out prisms, hyperopic correction, alternating occlusion, botulinum toxin injection, and strabismus surgery. In postsurgical consecutive esotropia, &#173;unless the deviation is very large or a slipped or “lost” muscle is suspected, surgery or botulinum toxin injection may be postponed for several months &#173;after onset &#173;because of the possibility of spontaneous improvement.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A slipped or lost lateral rectus muscle (discussed in Chapter&#160;14) produces vari&#173;ous amounts of esotropia and incomitance, depending on the amount of slippage, and should be suspected in consecutive esotropia following lateral rectus recession surgery if a significant abduction deficit is pres&#173;ent. However, if the ipsilateral medial rectus muscle was resected at the time of the lateral rectus recession, the consecutive esotropia could be due to a tight medial rectus muscle. Forced duction testing helps differentiate between &#173;these 2&#160;&#173;causes. In cases of a slipped or lost lateral rectus muscle, surgical exploration is required. (See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span>, <span class="xref-figure">Fig 14-1</span>, and the accompanying discussion.)</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-13">Nystagmus and Esotropia</p>
					<div id="Chapt8_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several types of nystagmus are associated with esotropia. <span class="italic">Fusion maldevelopment nystag</span><span class="italic">mus syndrome</span> (also known as <span class="italic">latent</span> and <span class="italic">manifest latent nystagmus</span>) is a common feature of&#160;infantile esotropia. Ciancia syndrome (discussed earlier in this chapter) is a severe form of infantile esotropia associated with an abducting nystagmus. <span class="italic">Nystagmus blockage syndrome</span> occurs in &#173;children with congenital motor nystagmus, who use convergence to “damp,” or decrease the amplitude or frequency of, their nystagmus, resulting in esotropia. See also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span>.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-13">Incomitant Esotropia</p>
					<div id="Chapt8_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are several positional, restrictive, and innervational abnormalities of the extraocular muscles that may result in incomitant esotropia (see &#173;<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;8-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Sixth Nerve Palsy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Weakness of the lateral rectus muscle due to palsy of the abducens nerve results in incomitant esotropia. Sixth cranial nerve palsy occurring in the neonatal period is rare and usually transient. Most cases of suspected congenital sixth nerve palsy are actually infantile esotropia with cross-&#173;fixation. Congenital sixth nerve palsy may be difficult to differentiate from esotropic Duane retraction syndrome, which is more common in young infants (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span>), as the unique retraction feature of this syndrome may not yet be evident. A distinguishing characteristic is that for an equal amount of abduction deficit, the deviation in primary position is usually much larger in sixth nerve palsy than it is in esotropic Duane retraction syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h3">Pathogenesis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital sixth nerve palsy is usually benign and transient and may be caused by the increased intracranial pressure associated with the birth pro&#173;cess. Sixth nerve palsy in older &#173;children is associated with intracranial lesions in approximately one-&#173;third of cases, which may have additional neurologic findings. Other cases may be related to infectious or immunologic pro&#173;cesses involving cranial nerve VI. The most common cause of isolated, transient sixth nerve palsy in a child is thought to be a virus; in an adult, a microvascular occlusive event.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical features and evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Older &#173;children and adults may report diplopia. Often &#173;there is a compensatory head turn &#173;toward the side of the para&#173;lyzed lateral rectus muscle, &#173;adopted to place the eyes in a position where they are best aligned. If a child pres&#173;ents soon &#173;after onset of the deviation, vision in the eyes is usually equal. The esotropia increases in gaze &#173;toward the side of the para&#173;lyzed lateral rectus muscle, and versions show limited or no abduction of the affected eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-3</span>). Results of the saccadic velocity test show slowing of the affected lateral rectus muscle, and active force generation tests document weakness of that muscle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A careful history should be taken, including antecedent infections, head trauma, and hydrocephalus, as well as hypertension and diabetes mellitus in adults. In light of the high prevalence of associated intracranial lesions in &#173;children with sixth nerve palsy, neurologic evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging of the head and orbit are usually indicated, even in the absence of other focal neurologic findings.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patching may be necessary to prevent or treat amblyopia if the child is not using a compensatory head posture or if the child is very young. Press-on prisms are sometimes used to correct diplopia in primary position. Correction of a significant hyperopic refractive error may help prevent the development of an associated accommodative esotropia. Botulinum toxin injection of the ipsilateral medial rectus muscle is sometimes employed to temporarily decrease the esotropia. If the deviation does not resolve &#173;after 6 months of treatment, surgery may be indicated. Options include horizontal rectus muscle surgery if abduction is at least partially preserved or vertical rectus muscle transposition surgery if abduction is absent (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">See BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for further discussion of sixth nerve palsy.</p>
			<p class="h2">Other Forms of Incomitant Esotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Medial rectus muscle restriction</span> may result from thyroid eye disease, orbital myositis, medial orbital wall fracture with medial rectus entrapment, excessive medial rectus muscle resection, or congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles. Duane retraction syndrome and M<span class="accent">ö</span>bius syndrome begin as paralytic disorders, and secondary restriction of the medial rectus may develop &#173;later. In patients with high myopia, esotropia may develop &#173;because of prolapse of the posterior globe between displaced lateral and superior rectus muscles.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For further discussion of &#173;these special forms of strabismus, see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span> in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span></p>
