			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Telecanthus</span> is characterized by a greater-&#173;than-&#173;normal distance between the inner canthi; it is distinct from, but may accompany, orbital hypertelorism (excessive distance between the medial orbital walls). In primary telecanthus, the abnormality is confined to the soft tissue, occurring without hypertelorism: the interpupillary distance is normal (see also Chapter&#160;17 and Fig 17-1). When telecanthus is secondary to hypertelorism, the interpupillary distance is greater than normal. Telecanthus is common in many syndromes.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Orbital hypotelorism</span> is smaller-&#173;than-&#173;normal distance between the medial orbital walls, with reduced inner and outer canthal distances. The finding is associated with more than 60 syndromes. Hypotelorism can be the result of skull malformation or a failure in brain development.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Exorbitism</span> is variously defined as prominent eyes due to shallow orbits or as an increased &#173;angle of divergence of the orbital walls.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Craniosynostosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cranial sutures are pres&#173;ent throughout the skull, which is divided into 2 parts, the <span class="italic">calvarium</span> and the <span class="italic">skull base,</span> via an imaginary line drawn from the supraorbital rims to the base of the occiput (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-1</span>). Cranial sutures normally fuse during the first 2&#160;years of life. <span class="italic">Craniosynostosis</span> is the premature closure of one or more cranial sutures during the embryonic period or early childhood.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Bony growth of the skull occurs in osteoblastic centers located at the suture sites. Bone is laid down parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the suture (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-2</span>). Premature suture closure prevents perpendicular growth but allows parallel growth. This growth pattern, called <span class="italic">Virchow’s law,</span> results in clinically recognizable cranial bone deformations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following are types of abnormal head shapes in infants, listed in order of decreasing frequency:</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Plagiocephaly</span> Most often plagiocephaly (Greek, <span class="italic">plagio,</span> “oblique”; <span class="italic">kephale,</span> “head”) is deformational, the consequence of external compressive forces, occurring prenatally or during infancy. Deformational plagiocephaly due to intrauterine constraint (eg, oligohydramnios) is characterized by ipsilateral occipital flattening with contralateral forehead flattening. This condition may also be caused by unilateral coronal suture synostosis. On the synostotic side, the forehead and supraorbital rim are retruded (depressed), the interpalpebral fissure is wider, and the orbit is often higher than on the nonsynostotic side. The nonsynostotic side displays a protruding or bulging forehead, a lower supraorbital rim, a narrower interpalpebral fissure, and frequently a lower orbital position.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Brachycephaly</span> Brachycephaly (literally, “short head”) is frequently the result of bilateral closure of the coronal sutures. Limited growth along the anterior-&#173;posterior axis results in a comparatively short head. Most often, the forehead is wide and flat.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Scaphocephaly</span> Scaphocephaly (literally, “boat head”) is usually a result of premature closure of the sagittal suture. &#173;There is anteroposterior elongation of the skull, along with bitemporal narrowing.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Dolichocephaly</span> In patients with dolichocephaly (literally, “long head”), the skull shape is similar to that in scaphocephaly.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Kleeblattsch</span><span class="h4-head-accent">ä</span><span class="h4-head">del</span> The skull shape is trilobar. Kleeblattsch<span class="accent">ä</span>del (“cloverleaf skull”) is typically the result of synostosis of the coronal, lambdoidal, and sagittal sutures.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Etiology of craniosynostosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Early suture fusion can be sporadic and occur as an isolated abnormality (eg, sagittal suture synostosis and most cases of unilateral coronal suture synostosis), or it can be part of a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic syndrome, associated with other abnormalities. Craniosynostosis syndromes are usually autosomal dominant conditions, often with associated limb abnormalities. Many of &#173;these syndromes have overlapping features, making accurate diagnosis based on clinical findings difficult. Identification of specific mutations may be diagnostic. Mutations in the fibroblast growth &#173;factor receptor genes <span class="italic">(FGFRs)</span> or in the <span class="italic">TWIST</span> gene are found in most patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Craniosynostosis syndromes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Common systemic features of the craniosynostosis syndromes include fusion of multiple calvarial sutures and skull base sutures. Syndactyly (partial fusion of the digits) and brachydactyly (short digits), ranging in severity, are hallmarks of &#173;these syndromes, the exception being Crouzon syndrome. The following sections discuss the most common types of craniosynostosis syndromes. All are autosomal dominant.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Crouzon syndrome</span> Crouzon syndrome is the most common craniosynostosis syndrome. Calvarial bone synostosis often includes both coronal sutures, resulting in a broad, retruded forehead; brachycephaly; and a tower-&#173;shaped skull. The skull base sutures are also involved, leading to varying degrees of midfacial retrusion. &#173;There is marked variability of the skull and facial features, with milder cases escaping diagnosis through multiple generations. Hypertelorism and proptosis, with inferior scleral show, are the most frequent features of Crouzon syndrome (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-3</span>). Hydrocephalus is common, but intelligence is usually normal. Typically, findings are limited to the head. Unlike in the other syndromes, patients with Crouzon syndrome do not have anomalies of the hands and feet; thus, the presence or absence of &#173;these anomalies in a patient can aid diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Apert syndrome</span> Fusion of multiple calvarial sutures, most often both coronal sutures, and skull base suture fusion are usually found in patients with Apert syndrome. The skull shape and facial features of &#173;these patients resemble &#173;those of Crouzon patients. Apert syndrome, however, is associated with an often extreme amount of syndactyly (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-4</span>), in which most or all digits of the hands and feet are completely fused <span class="italic">(mitten deformity).</span> Apert syndrome is likely to be associated with internal organ (cardiovascular and genitourinary) malformations and &#173;mental deficiency. Hydrocephalus is less common in this syndrome than in Crouzon syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Pfeiffer syndrome</span> Patients with Pfeiffer syndrome have craniofacial abnormalities resembling &#173;those of Apert patients but often have more severe craniosynostosis, resulting in a cloverleaf skull. &#173;There is a high risk of hydrocephalus. The syndactyly is much less severe, and patients have characteristic short, broad thumbs and toes.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Saethre-&#173;Chotzen syndrome</span> The features of Saethre-&#173;Chotzen syndrome are much milder than &#173;those of other craniosynostosis syndromes; this syndrome is therefore underdiagnosed. Early suture fusion is not a constant feature but, when pres&#173;ent, typically involves 1&#160;coronal suture (plagiocephaly), resulting in facial asymmetry. Other common features are ptosis, low hairline, and ear abnormalities. Abnormalities of the hands and feet include brachydactyly and mild syndactyly (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-5</span>). Intelligence is usually normal.</p>
			<p class="h3">Ocular complications of craniosynostosis</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-3"><span class="h4-head">Proptosis</span> Proptosis (or exorbitism) results from the reduced volume of the bony orbit. The severity of the proptosis in patients with craniosynostosis is not uniform and frequently increases with age &#173;because of the impaired growth of the bony orbit.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Corneal exposure</span> &#173;Because the eyelids may not close completely over the proptotic globes, corneal exposure may occur, with pos&#173;si&#173;ble development of exposure keratitis. Aggressive lubrication may be necessary to prevent corneal drying. Tarsorrhaphy can reduce the exposure. Surgically expanding the orbital volume, thereby eliminating the proptosis, may be indicated in extreme cases.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Globe luxation</span> In patients with extremely shallow orbits, globe luxation may occur when the eyelids are manipulated or when &#173;there is increased pressure in the orbits, such as occurs with a Valsalva maneuver. The globe is luxated forward, the eyelids closing &#173;behind the equator of the globe. The condition is very painful and can cause corneal exposure. It may also compromise the blood supply to the globe, which is a medical emergency. Physicians and patients (or their caregivers) should quickly reposition the globe &#173;behind the eyelids. The best technique for &#173;doing this is to place a fin&#173;ger and thumb over the conjunctiva within the interpalpebral fissure and exert gentle but firm pressure; this technique does not damage the cornea. For recurrent luxation, the short-&#173;term solution is tarsorrhaphy; the long-&#173;term solution is orbital volume expansion.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Strabismus</span> Patients with craniosynostosis show a variety of horizontal deviations in primary position; exotropia is the most frequent. The most consistent finding, however, is a marked V pattern (see Chapter&#160;10). This V pattern is often accompanied by a marked overelevation in adduction, especially when 1 or both coronal sutures are fused, as occurs in unilateral coronal suture synostosis and Apert (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-6</span>) and Crouzon syndromes. The apparent overaction (often pseudo-&#173;overaction) of the inferior oblique muscle on the side of the coronal suture fusion may be due to one of the following: orbital and globe extorsion, which converts the medial rectus muscle into an elevator when the eye is in adduction; superior oblique trochlear retrusion (&#173;because of superior orbital rim retrusion), which induces superior oblique underaction and secondary true inferior oblique overaction; anomalous extraocular muscle insertions or agenesis; or orbital pulley abnormalities (see Chapter&#160;3).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Optic nerve abnormalities</span> Optic nerve damage may occur for several reasons in patients with craniosynostosis. Optic nerve function may deteriorate in patients with chronically elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), which may result from hydrocephalus or be caused by crowding of the intracranial contents due to synostosis. In patients with midfacial retrusion, sleep apnea may develop and can cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension. In rare cases, optic nerve damage can occur secondary to compression stemming from synostosis of <br />the optic foramina. Optic atrophy may occur with or without antecedent papilledema. &#173;Because &#173;children with elevated ICP may not report headache, a common symptom of this condition, young patients with multiple fused sutures should be monitored for this complication.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Ocular adnexal abnormalities</span> Common ocular adnexal abnormalities include orbital hypertelorism, telecanthus, abnormal slant of the palpebral fissures secondary to superior displacement of the medial canthi, ptosis, and nasolacrimal abnormalities. Epiphora is common and may be secondary to nasolacrimal duct obstruction, poor blink secondary to proptosis, obliquity of the palpebral fissures, or ocular irritation from corneal exposure.</p>
			<p class="h3">Surgical management of craniosynostosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Reconstructive surgery for severe craniofacial malformation is frequently extensive and involves en bloc movement of the facial structures. The status of the visual system should be documented preoperatively and monitored postoperatively, with appropriate treatment as indicated. Procedures that involve moving the orbits may significantly change the degree or type of strabismus. &#173;Because of this, deferring treatment of strabismus &#173;until craniofacial surgery is completed may be appropriate.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Nonsynostotic Craniofacial Conditions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many craniofacial syndromes do not involve synostosis. Nonsynostotic syndromes and conditions of par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar importance to the ophthalmologist are discussed in the following sections.</p>
			<p class="h3">Anophthalmia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Anophthalmia (anophthalmos),</span> the absence of tissues of the eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-7</span>), is the most severe and rare phenotypic expression of a spectrum of abnormalities that includes typical coloboma and microphthalmia (see also Chapter&#160;21). &#173;These conditions may be isolated, but they are frequently associated with other congenital anomalies. Anophthalmia and severe microphthalmia are associated with hypoplastic orbits and eyelids. Vari&#173;ous techniques have been utilized for orbital expansion. The best results are achieved with early treatment.</p>
			<p class="h3">Branchial arch syndromes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Branchial arch syndromes are caused by disruptions in the embryonic development of the first 2 branchial arches, which are responsible for formation of the maxillary and mandibular bones, the ear, and facial musculature. The <span class="italic">oculoauriculovertebral spectrum (OAVS),</span> which includes hemifacial microsomia and Goldenhar syndrome, and Treacher Collins syndrome are the best-&#173;known branchial arch syndromes. Hemifacial microsomia is a milder form of OAVS. Patients with OAVS may have vertebral abnormalities such as hemivertebrae and vertebral hypoplasia. They may also have neurologic, cardiovascular, and genitourinary abnormalities. Most cases are sporadic.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Goldenhar syndrome</span> Patients with Goldenhar syndrome have hemifacial microsomia (unilateral or bilateral) and characteristic ophthalmic abnormalities (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-8</span>). Most cases are sporadic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Epibulbar (limbal) dermoids and dermolipomas are characteristic ocular signs. Dermolipomas (also termed <span class="italic">lipodermoids</span>) usually occur in the temporal quadrant, covered by conjunctiva and often hidden by the lateral upper and lower eyelids. Epi&#173;bulbar limbal dermoids occur more frequently than dermolipomas and can be bilateral (approximately 25% of cases). They occasionally impinge on the visual axis but more commonly interfere with vision by causing astigmatism and anisometropic amblyopia. Eyelid colobomas may occur. Other ocular conditions include microphthalmia, cataract, and iris abnormalities. Duane retraction syndrome is more common in patients with Goldenhar syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treacher Collins syndrome</span> Treacher Collins syndrome (mandibulofacial dysostosis) is caused by abnormal growth of the first and second branchial arches, with underdevelopment and even agenesis of the zygoma and malar eminences. The lateral orbital rims are depressed and the palpebral fissures slant downward &#173;because of lateral canthal dystopia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-9</span>). Pseudocolobomas (uncommonly, true colobomas) occur in the outer third of the lower eyelids. Meibomian glands may be absent. The cilia of the lower eyelid medial to the pseudocoloboma may also be absent. The ears are malformed and hearing loss is common. The mandible is typically hypoplastic, leading to micrognathia. Intelligence is normal. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Most affected patients have a mutation in the <span class="italic">TCOF1</span> gene.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Pierre Robin sequence</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Pierre Robin sequence (also <span class="italic">anomaly, deformity</span>) is characterized by micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate. The sequence is a frequent finding in Stickler syndrome. Associated ocular anomalies include ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, microphthalmia, congenital glaucoma, cataracts, and high myopia.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Fetal alcohol syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fetal alcohol syndrome is caused by in utero exposure to ethanol. It is characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, central ner&#173;vous system and craniofacial abnormalities, and intellectual disability.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The classic ocular features of fetal alcohol syndrome are short palpebral fissures, telecanthus, epicanthus, ptosis, microphthalmia, and esotropia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-10</span>). Anterior segment dysgenesis, optic nerve hypoplasia, and high refractive errors have been reported. Fifty&#160;&#173;percent of &#173;children with this underdiagnosed syndrome have some form of visual impairment.</p>
			<p class="h3">Nonsynostotic disorders of bone growth</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-3"><span class="h4-head">Infantile malignant osteopetrosis</span> In this rare and severe autosomal recessive form of &#173;osteopetrosis, proliferation of bone results in narrowing of the foramina of the skull. Stenosis of the optic canal increases the risk of compressive optic neuropathy. Bone marrow transplant has been reported to reverse the stenosis.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Craniometaphyseal dysplasia</span> Craniometaphyseal dysplasia is a rare disorder of osteoclast resorption that &#173;causes hyperostosis of the cranial bones. The typical facial appearance includes frontal and paranasal bossing. Progressive stenosis of cranial nerve foramina can result in compressive optic neuropathy.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Infectious and Inflammatory Conditions</p>
			<div id="Chapt18_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Preseptal and orbital cellulitis usually pro&#173;gress more rapidly and are more severe in &#173;children than in adults. See also BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Preseptal Cellulitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Preseptal cellulitis, a common infection in &#173;children, is an inflammatory pro&#173;cess involving the tissues anterior to the orbital septum. Eyelid edema may extend into the forehead. The periorbital skin becomes taut and inflamed, and edema of the contralateral eyelids may appear. Proptosis is not a feature of preseptal cellulitis, and the globe remains uninvolved. Full ocular motility and absence of pain on eye movement help distinguish preseptal from orbital cellulitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Preseptal cellulitis typically develops in 1 of 3 ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">following puncture, insect bite, or laceration of the eyelid skin (posttraumatic cellulitis): In &#173;these cases, organisms found on the skin, such as <span class="italic">Staphylococcus</span> or <span class="italic">Streptococcus</span> species, are most commonly responsible for the infection.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">in conjunction with severe conjunctivitis such as epidemic keratoconjunctivitis or methicillin-&#173;resistant <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus </span>(MRSA) conjunctivitis, or with skin infection such as impetigo or herpes zoster.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">secondary to upper respiratory tract or sinus infection: <span class="italic">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> and other streptococcal species, and <span class="italic">S aureus</span> are the most common causative organisms.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Children with nonsevere preseptal infections can be treated with oral antibiotics as outpatients. Broad-&#173;spectrum drugs effective against the most common pathogens, such as cephalosporins or ampicillin–&#173;clavulanic acid combination, are usually effective. Particularly with eyelid abscesses, clindamycin may be an appropriate choice &#173;because of the increasing prevalence of MRSA, which should also be considered in patients who do not improve with treatment. Eyelid abscesses may require urgent incision and drainage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For young infants or patients with signs of systemic illness such as sepsis or meningeal involvement, hospital admission may be indicated for appropriate cultures, imaging of the sinuses and orbits, and intravenous (IV) antibiotics. In newborns, dacryocystocele should be considered in the differential diagnosis (see Chapter&#160;19).</p>
			<p class="h2">Orbital Cellulitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital cellulitis involves the tissues posterior to the orbital septum. It is most commonly associated with ethmoid or frontal sinusitis but can also occur following penetrating injuries of the orbit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most young &#173;children with orbital cellulitis have infections caused by a single aerobic pathogen. In the neonate, <span class="italic">S aureus</span> and gram-&#173;negative bacilli are most common. In older &#173;children and adults, <span class="italic">S aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes,</span> and <span class="italic">S pneumoniae</span> are common etiologic agents. Concurrent infections with multiple pathogens, including gram-&#173;negative and anaerobic organisms, can occur in older or immunosuppressed patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Early signs and symptoms of orbital cellulitis include lethargy, fever, eyelid edema, rhinorrhea, headache, orbital pain, and tenderness on palpation. The nasal mucosa becomes hyperemic, with a purulent nasal discharge. Increased venous congestion may cause elevated intraocular pressure. Proptosis, chemosis, and limited ocular movement suggest orbital involvement.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of orbital cellulitis includes nonspecific orbital inflammation, benign orbital tumors such as lymphatic malformation and hemangioma, and malignant tumors such as rhabdomyosarcoma, leukemia, and metastases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Paranasal sinusitis is the most common cause of bacterial orbital cellulitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-11</span>). In &#173;children younger than 10&#160;years, the ethmoid sinuses are most frequently involved. If orbital cellulitis is suspected, orbital imaging is indicated to confirm orbital involvement, to document the presence and extent of sinusitis and a subperiosteal abscess (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-12</span>), and to rule out a foreign body in a patient with a history of trauma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is crucial to distinguish orbital cellulitis from preseptal cellulitis &#173;because the former requires hospital admission and treatment with IV broad-&#173;spectrum antibiotics. Choice of IV antibiotic is based on the most likely pathogens &#173;until results from cultures are known. If associated sinusitis or subperiosteal abscess is pres&#173;ent, pediatric otolaryngologists should be consulted. The patient should be observed closely for signs of visual compromise. Many subperiosteal abscesses in &#173;children younger than 9&#160;years resolve with medical management. Emergency drainage of a subperiosteal abscess is indicated for a patient of any age with <span class="italic">&#173;either</span> of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-7">evidence of optic nerve compromise (decreasing vision, relative afferent pupillary defect) and an enlarging subperiosteal abscess</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-8">an abscess that does not resolve within 48–72 hours of administration of antibiotics</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intraconal orbital abscesses are much less common than subperiosteal abscesses in &#173;children and require urgent surgical drainage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Complications of orbital cellulitis include cavernous sinus thrombosis and intracranial extension (subdural or brain abscesses, meningitis, periosteal abscess), which may result in death. Cavernous sinus thrombosis can be difficult to distinguish from &#173;simple orbital cellulitis. Paralysis of eye movement in cavernous sinus thrombosis is often out of proportion to the degree of proptosis. Pain on motion and tenderness on palpation are absent. Decreased sensation along the maxillary division of cranial nerve V (trigeminal) supports the diagnosis. Bilateral involvement is virtually diagnostic of cavernous sinus thrombosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other complications of orbital cellulitis include corneal exposure with secondary ulcerative keratitis, neurotrophic keratitis, secondary glaucoma, septic uveitis or retinitis, exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, optic nerve edema, inflammatory neuritis, infectious neuritis, central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion, and panophthalmitis.</p>

			<p class="h3">Related conditions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Fungal orbital cellulitis (mucormycosis)</span> occurs most frequently in patients with ketoacidosis or severe immunosuppression. The infection &#173;causes thrombosing vasculitis with ischemic necrosis of involved tissue (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-13</span>). Cranial nerves often are involved, and extension into the central ner&#173;vous system is common. Smears and biopsy of the involved tissues reveal the fungal organisms. Treatment includes debridement and systemic administration of antifungal medi&#173;cation. <span class="italic">Allergic fungal sinusitis</span> is a less fulminant condition that frequently pres&#173;ents with orbital signs, including proptosis from remodeling of the bony orbit. See BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2">Childhood Orbital Inflammation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several noninfectious, nontraumatic disorders cause orbital inflammation in &#173;children that may simulate infection or an orbital mass lesion. Thyroid eye disease, the most common cause of proptosis in adults, rarely occurs in prepubescent &#173;children but occasionally affects adolescents. Bilateral orbital inflammation may occur with sarcoidosis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Nonspecific orbital inflammation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI) (also known as <span class="italic">orbital pseudotumor, idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome</span>) is an inflammatory cause of proptosis in childhood that differs significantly from the adult form. The typical pediatric pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion is acute and painful, more closely resembling orbital cellulitis than tumor or thyroid eye disease (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-14</span>). NSOI is often bilateral and may be associated with systemic manifestations such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. Uveitis is frequently pres&#173;ent and occasionally constitutes the dominant manifestation. Imaging studies may show increased density of orbital fat, thickening of posterior sclera and the Tenon layer, or enlargement of extraocular muscles. The lacrimal gland is often involved. Sinusitis is typically not pres&#173;ent. Systemic treatment with a corticosteroid usually provides prompt and dramatic relief. Recurrent disease is common. A slow tapering of corticosteroid dosage is usually required to prevent recurrence.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Orbital myositis</span> Orbital myositis describes NSOI that is confined to one or more extraocular muscles. The clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion depends on the amount of inflammation. Diplopia, conjunctival chemosis, and orbital pain are common. Symptoms can be subacute or pro&#173;gress rapidly. Vision is rarely impaired &#173;unless massive muscle enlargement is pres&#173;ent. Imaging studies show diffusely enlarged muscles with the enlargement extending all the way to the insertion (unlike in thyroid myopathy, which mainly involves the muscle belly). Corticosteroid treatment usually produces rapid relief of symptoms. Prolonged treatment is often necessary, and recurrence is common.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diagnosis of space-&#173;occupying lesions in the orbit is particularly challenging &#173;because the clinical manifestations are both nonspecific and relatively limited:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">proptosis or other displacement of the globe</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">swelling or discoloration of the eyelids</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">palpable subcutaneous mass</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ptosis</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">strabismus</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many orbital pro&#173;cesses may cause rapid onset of symptoms. &#173;These include trauma, which may occur without a reliable history. Mild or moderate proptosis can be difficult to detect in an uncooperative child with associated eyelid swelling. Nevertheless, typical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions of the more common benign orbital and periorbital masses in infants and &#173;children (eg, hemangioma and dermoid cyst, discussed &#173;later) are sufficiently distinctive to permit confident clinical diagnosis in most cases. A malignant pro&#173;cess should be suspected when proptosis and eyelid swelling suggestive of cellulitis are not accompanied by signs of inflammation or when periorbital ecchymosis or hematoma develops in the absence of a history of trauma. Pseudoproptosis can result when the volume of the globe exceeds the capacity of the orbit (eg, patients with primary congenital glaucoma or high myopia).</p>
			<p class="body-text">High-&#173;quality imaging allows orbital masses to be differentiated noninvasively in many cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred modality for most patients. Computed tomography (CT) is superior at detecting bone abnormalities but exposes the child to radiation and thus should be avoided &#173;unless necessary. Ultrasonography may be&#160;useful.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Definitive diagnosis often requires biopsy. A pediatric oncologist should be consulted when appropriate. A metastatic workup should be considered prior to orbital surgery, &#173;because other, more easily accessible sites can sometimes be biopsied.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Primary Malignant Neoplasms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Malignant diseases of the orbit include primary and metastatic tumors. Most primary malignant tumors of the orbit in childhood are sarcomas. Tumors of epithelial origin are extremely rare.</p>
			<p class="h3">Rhabdomyosarcoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common primary orbital malignant tumor in &#173;children is rhabdomyosarcoma, which is thought to originate from undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. The incidence of this disease (which is found in approximately 5% of pediatric orbital biopsies) exceeds that of all other sarcomas combined. The orbit is the origin of 10% of rhabdomyosarcomas; 25% of &#173;these tumors arise elsewhere in the head and neck, occasionally involving the orbit secondarily. The average age at onset is 5–7&#160;years, but rhabdomyosarcoma can occur at any age. Rhabdomyosarcoma in infancy is more aggressive and carries a poorer prognosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although ocular rhabdomyosarcoma usually originates in the orbit, it occasionally arises in the conjunctiva, eyelid, or anterior uveal tract. Presenting signs and symptoms include proptosis (80%–100% of cases), globe displacement (80%), blepharoptosis (30%–50%) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-15</span>), conjunctival and eyelid swelling (60%), palpable mass (25%), and pain (10%). Onset of symptoms and signs is usually rapid. Acute, rapidly progressive proptosis with an absence of pain are suggestive of orbital rhabdomyosarcoma. Imaging shows an irregular but well-&#173;circumscribed mass of uniform density.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A biopsy is required for confirmation of the diagnosis whenever rhabdomyosarcoma is suspected. The most common histologic type is embryonal, which shows few cells containing characteristic cross-&#173;striations. Second in frequency is the prognostically unfavorable alveolar pattern, showing poorly differentiated tumor cells compartmentalized by orderly connective tissue septa. Botryoid (grapelike) or well-&#173;differentiated pleomorphic tumors are rarely found in the orbit but may originate in the conjunctiva.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Small encapsulated or other&#173;wise well-&#173;localized rhabdomyosarcomas should be totally excised when pos&#173;si&#173;ble. Usually, chemotherapy and radiation are used in conjunction with surgery. Exenteration of the orbit is seldom indicated. Primary orbital rhabdomyosarcoma has a relatively good prognosis. The 5-&#173;year survival rates are 74% and 94% for patients with alveolar cell type and &#173;those with embryonal cell type, respectively.</p>
			<p class="h3">Other sarcomas</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma can develop in the orbit during childhood. The risk of sarcoma is increased in &#173;children with a history of heritable retinoblastoma, particularly when external-&#173;beam radiation treatment has been given.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Metastatic Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The orbit is the most common site of ocular metastasis in &#173;children, in contrast to adults, in whom the uvea is the most frequent site.</p>
			<p class="h3">Neuroblastoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neuroblastoma is the most frequent source of orbital metastasis in childhood. This disorder is discussed in Chapter&#160;28.</p>
			<p class="h3">Ewing sarcoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ewing sarcoma is composed of small round cells and usually originates in the long bones of the extremities or in the axial skeleton. Among solid tumors, Ewing sarcoma is the second most frequent source of orbital metastasis. Treatment regimens involving surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy allow long-&#173;term survival in many patients with disseminated disease.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Hematopoietic, Lymphoproliferative, and Histiocytic Neoplasms</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Leukemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Leukemic infiltration of the orbit is relatively uncommon and more characteristic of acute myelogenous leukemia. Orbital involvement may be difficult to distinguish from bacterial or fungal orbital cellulitis. Orbital infiltration can cause proptosis, eyelid swelling, and ecchymosis. It may be best managed by radiation therapy. <span class="italic">Granulocytic sarcoma,</span> or <span class="italic">chloroma</span> (in reference to the greenish color of involved tissue), is a localized accumulation of myeloid leukemic cells; the tumor may occur anywhere in the body, including in the orbit. This lesion may develop several months before leukemia becomes evident hematologically. Leukemia is discussed in Chapter&#160;28.</p>
			<p class="h3">Lymphoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In contrast with lymphoma in adults, lymphoma in &#173;children very rarely involves the orbit. Burkitt lymphoma, endemic to East Africa and uncommon in North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca, is the most likely form to involve the orbit.</p>
			<p class="h3">Langerhans cell histiocytosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Langerhans cell histiocytosis</span> (<span class="italic">LCH;</span> formerly called <span class="italic">histiocytosis X</span>) is the collective term for a group of disorders, usually arising in childhood, that involve abnormal proliferation of histiocytes, often within bone. The disorders are classified as unifocal eosinophilic granuloma of the bone, multifocal eosinophilic granuloma of the bone, and diffuse soft-&#173;tissue histiocytosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Unifocal eosinophilic granuloma,</span> the most localized and benign form of LCH, produces a bone lesion that involves the orbit, skull, ribs, or long bones in childhood or adolescence. Signs and symptoms may include proptosis, ptosis, and periorbital swelling; localized pain and tenderness are relatively common. CT characteristically shows sharply demarcated osteolytic lesions without surrounding sclerosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-16</span>). Treatment consists of observation of isolated asymptomatic lesions, excision or curettage, systemic or intralesional corticosteroid administration, or low-&#173;dose radiation therapy. All modalities have a high rate of success.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Multifocal eosinophilic granuloma of the bone</span> is a disseminated and aggressive form of LCH. It usually pres&#173;ents between 2 and 5&#160;years of age and may produce proptosis from involvement of the bony orbit. Diabetes insipidus is common. Chemotherapy is often required, but the prognosis is generally good.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Diffuse soft-&#173;tissue histiocytosis,</span> the most severe form, usually affects infants younger than 2&#160;years. It is characterized by soft-&#173;tissue lesions of multiple viscera (liver, spleen) but rarely involves the eye.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Benign Tumors</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Vascular lesions: hemangiomas</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The current classification of vascular lesions establishes clinical, histologic, and prognostic differences between hemangiomas and vascular malformations. The older terms <span class="italic">capillary</span> and <span class="italic">strawberry hemangioma</span> have been replaced by the single term <span class="italic">hemangioma.</span> Cavernous hemangiomas, port-&#173;wine stains, and lymphangiomas are classified as “malformations.” This nomenclature has not been used consistently in the ophthalmologic lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hemangiomas are hamartomatous growths composed of proliferating capillary endothelial cells. Periocular hemangiomas can be classified as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-12">preseptal, involving the skin and preseptal orbit</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">intraorbital, involving the postseptal orbit</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-13">compound/mixed, involving the preseptal and postseptal orbit</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Hemangiomas occur in 1%–3% of term newborns and are more common in premature infants, in females, and &#173;after chorionic villus sampling. Most hemangiomas are clinically insignificant at birth. They can be inapparent or can appear as an erythematous macule or a telangiectasia. The natu&#173;ral history is one of rapid proliferation and growth over the first several months of life, rarely lasting beyond 1 year. Periocular lesions may cause amblyopia by inducing astigmatism or obstructing the visual axis. &#173;After the first year of life, the lesions usually begin to regress, although the rate and degree of involution vary.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Systemic disease associated with hemangiomas</span> <span class="italic">PHACE</span> is an acronym for <span class="italic">p</span>osterior fossa malformations, <span class="italic">h</span>emangiomas, <span class="italic">a</span>rterial lesions, and <span class="italic">c</span>ardiac and <span class="italic">e</span>ye anomalies. The eye abnormalities include increased ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascularity, microphthalmia, optic nerve hypoplasia, proptosis, choroidal hemangiomas, strabismus, colobomas, cataracts, and glaucoma. The PHACE syndrome should be considered in any infant presenting with a large, segmental, plaquelike facial hemangioma involving one or more dermatomes (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-17</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Kasabach-&#173;Merritt syndrome</span> is a thrombocytopenic coagulopathy with a high mortality rate. It is caused by sequestration of platelets within a vascular lesion.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis</span> is a potentially lethal condition that occurs in infants, with multiple small cutaneous hemangiomas associated with visceral lesions affecting the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. &#173;These hemangiomas are initially asymptomatic but can lead to cardiac failure and death within weeks. Infants with more than 3 cutaneous lesions should be evaluated for visceral lesions.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treatment of hemangiomas</span> The diagnosis of hemangiomas is usually obvious from the clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion. MRI or ultrasonography is sometimes helpful in establishing the diagnosis and delineating the posterior extent of the lesion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Observation is indicated when hemangiomas are small and &#173;there is no risk of amblyopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Propranolol, a nonselective <a href="https://www.dorlands.com/dorlands/def.jsp?id=100002230"><span class="greek-tx">β</span><span class="Hyperlink">-&#173;adrenergic blocking agent</span></a>, induces involution of most hemangiomas (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-18</span>). The risks of systemic treatment with <span class="greek-tx">β</span>-&#173;blockers in infants include bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and bronchospasm, but the medi&#173;cation is usually well tolerated. Par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar caution should be taken when propranolol is used in &#173;children with PHACE syndrome, &#173;because this drug may increase their risk of stroke. Timolol maleate solution applied topically may be effective in treating superficial hemangiomas. Pulsed dye &#173;laser can treat superficial hemangiomas with few complications, but it has &#173;little effect on deeper components of the tumor.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgical excision of periocular hemangiomas is feasible for some well-&#173;localized lesions or for lesions that do not respond to propranolol.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Vascular lesions: malformations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vascular malformations are developmental anomalies derived from capillary venous, arterial, or lymphatic vessels. In contrast to hemangiomas, vascular malformations remain relatively static. The age at onset and mode of clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion vary. Cutaneous vascular malformations such as port-&#173;wine stains are evident from birth, but many vascular malformations do not manifest &#173;until &#173;later in life.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Orbital lymphatic malformation</span> Orbital lymphatic malformation, previously known as <span class="italic">lymphangioma,</span> may produce proptosis in infancy, but usually does not &#173;until the second de&#173;cade of life or &#173;later. Unilateral smaller cornea, anomalous anterior segment vessels, and abnormal ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessel branching in association with orbital lymphatic malformation represent a unique malformation syndrome. Lymphatic malformation of the orbit is best managed conservatively. Exacerbations tend to occur during upper respiratory tract infections and may be managed with a short &#173;course of systemic corticosteroids. Rapid expansion may be seen in cases of intralesional hemorrhage (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-19</span>). Partial resection and drainage may be required if vision is threatened. &#173;Because of the infiltrative character of this malformation, complete removal is usually impossible. Newer treatments include oral sildenafil and intralesional injection of sclerosing agents.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Orbital venous malformations</span> Orbital venous malformations, or varices, can be divided into 2 types: primary and secondary. The primary type is confined to the orbit and is not associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Secondary orbital varices occur as a result of intracranial AVM shunts that cause dilation of the orbital veins. Orbital venous malformations usually become symptomatic &#173;after years of progressive congestion and rarely manifest before the second de&#173;cade of life. Treatment is reserved for highly symptomatic lesions.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Orbital arteriovenous malformations</span> AVMs isolated within the orbit are extremely rare. Patients with congenital AVMs of the ret&#173;ina and midbrain (<span class="italic">Wyburn-&#173;Mason syndrome;</span> see Chapter&#160;28) may have orbital involvement. AVMs of the bony orbit rarely manifest in childhood but when pres&#173;ent are characterized by pulsatile proptosis, chemosis, congested conjunctival vessels, and elevated intraocular pressure. AVMs may be treated by embolization, surgical resection, or both.</p>
			<p class="h3">Tumors of bony origin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">During the early years of life, a variety of uncommon benign orbital tumors of bony origin can pres&#173;ent with gradually increasing proptosis. <span class="italic">Fibrous dysplasia</span> and <span class="italic">juvenile ossifying fibroma</span> are similar disorders in which normal bone is replaced by fibro-&#173;osseous tissue. In both conditions, orbital CT shows varying degrees of lucency and sclerosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fibrous dysplasia has a slow progression that ceases when skeletal maturation is complete. The most serious complication is vision loss caused by optic nerve compression, which may occur acutely. Periodic assessment of vision, pupil function, and optic disc appearance is indicated. Surgical treatment is indicated for functional deterioration or disfigurement.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Juvenile ossifying fibroma is distinguished histologically by the presence of osteoblasts. It tends to be more locally invasive than fibrous dysplasia; some authorities recommend early excision.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Brown tumor of bone</span> is an osteoclastic &#173;giant cell reaction resulting from hyperparathyroidism. <span class="italic">Aneurysmal bone cyst</span> is a degenerative pro&#173;cess in which normal bone is replaced by cystic cavities containing fibrous tissue, inflammatory cells, and blood, producing a characteristic radiographic appearance.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Tumors of connective tissue origin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Benign orbital tumors originating from connective tissue are rare in childhood. <span class="italic">Juvenile fibromatosis</span> may pres&#173;ent as a mass in the inferoanterior part of the orbit. &#173;These tumors, sometimes called <span class="italic">myofibromas</span> or <span class="italic">desmoid tumors,</span> are composed of relatively mature fibroblasts. They tend to recur locally &#173;after excision and can be difficult to control, but they do not metastasize.</p>
			<p class="h3">Tumors of neural origin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Optic pathway glioma</span> is the most impor&#173;tant orbital tumor of neural origin in childhood. Optic pathway gliomas are usually low-&#173;grade pilocytic astrocytomas, but the rate of growth with or without therapeutic intervention is unpredictable. Management of &#173;these tumors is controversial and depends largely on their location. Approximately 30% of optic pathway gliomas are associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. <span class="italic">Plexiform neurofibroma</span> nearly always occurs in the context of neurofibromatosis and frequently involves the eyelid and orbit. See Chapter&#160;28 for further discussion of plexiform neurofibroma and optic pathway glioma. Orbital <span class="italic">meningioma</span> and <span class="italic">schwannoma</span> (neurilemoma, neurinoma) are rare in childhood.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-15">Ectopic Tissue Masses</p>
			<div id="Chapt18_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">choristoma</span> is applied to growths consisting of tissue that is histologically normal but pres&#173;ent in an abnormal location. The growths may result from abnormal sequestration of germ layer tissue during embryonic development or from faulty differentiation of pluripotential cells. Masses composed of such ec&#173;topic tissue that are growing in the orbit can also be a consequence of herniation of tissue from adjacent structures.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cystic Lesions</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Dermoid and epidermoid cysts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Dermoid cysts</span> are the most common space-&#173;occupying orbital lesions of childhood. They are benign developmental choristomas that arise from primitive dermal and epidermal ele&#173;ments sequestered in fetal skull suture lines. The tissue forms a cyst lined with keratinized epithelium and dermal appendages, including hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. Cysts containing squamous epithelium without dermal appendages are called <span class="italic">epidermoid cysts.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Orbital dermoid cysts in childhood most commonly arise in the superotemporal and superonasal quadrants (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-20</span>) but sometimes extend into the bony suture line. Clinically, they pres&#173;ent as painless, smooth masses that are mobile and unattached to overlying skin. Inflammation may occur with ruptures of the cyst and extrusion of cyst contents. Most patients have no visual symptoms. Clinical examination is often sufficient for diagnosis. In some cases, imaging is indicated to identify and delineate the extent of the cyst. Imaging reveals a well-&#173;circumscribed lesion with a low-&#173;density lumen and often bony remodeling (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-21</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Management of dermoid cysts is surgical. Early excision can reduce the risk of traumatic rupture and subsequent inflammation. An infrabrow or eyelid crease incision is used, and the cyst is carefully dissected. If pos&#173;si&#173;ble, rupture of the cyst at the time of surgery is avoided to limit lipogranulomatous inflammation and scarring. If the cyst is entered, the intraluminal material should be thoroughly removed. Sutural cysts sometimes cannot be removed intact &#173;because of their extension into or through bone. To limit the possibility of recurrence, the surgeon must attempt removal of all remaining cyst lining.</p>
			<p class="h3">Microphthalmia with cyst</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Microphthalmia with cyst (also known as <span class="italic">colobomatous cyst</span>) is characterized by a small, malformed globe with posterior segment coloboma and a cyst composed of tissues originating from the eye wall of the globe. Most fundus colobomas show some degree of scleral ectasia. In extreme cases, a bulging globular appendage grows to become as large as or larger than the globe itself, which is invariably microphthalmic, sometimes to a marked degree.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Microphthalmia with cyst may occur &#173;either as an isolated congenital defect or in association with a variety of intracranial or systemic anomalies. Frequently, the fellow eye shows evidence of coloboma as well. The usual location of the cyst is inferior or posterior to the globe, with which the cyst is always in contact.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Whether posteriorly located cysts cause proptosis depends on the size of the globe and the cyst. Inferiorly located cysts pres&#173;ent as a bulging of the lower eyelid or a bluish subconjunctival mass (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-22</span>). If fundus examination does not make the diagnosis obvious, orbital imaging may reveal a cystic lesion that is attached to the globe and has the uniform internal density of vitreous. The goal of treatment is to promote normal growth of the orbit; methods include aspiration or surgical excision of the cyst, and use of orbital expanders and conformers.</p>
			<p class="h3">Mucocele</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mucoceles are cystic lesions that originate from obstructed paranasal sinus drainage. They may expand over time, potentially causing destruction of bone and eroding into the orbit or intracranial space. &#173;These lesions most commonly arise from the frontal or anterior ethmoid sinuses, resulting in inferior or medial displacement of the globe. The differential diagnosis includes encephalocele with skull base deformity. Treatment involves reestablishing normal sinus drainage and removing the cyst wall.</p>
			<p class="h3">Encephalocele and meningocele</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Encephaloceles and meningoceles in the orbital region may result from a congenital bony defect that allows herniation of intracranial tissue, or they may develop &#173;after trauma that disrupts the bone and dura mater of the anterior cranial fossa. An intraorbital location leads to proptosis or downward displacement of the globe. Anterior pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion takes the form of a subcutaneous mass that can be misdiagnosed as a dacryocystocele. However, encephaloceles and meningoceles are typically located above the medial canthal tendon; dacryocystoceles are typically located below it (see Chapter&#160;19). Pulsation of the globe or the mass from the transmission of intracranial pulse pressure is characteristic. Neuroimaging confirms the diagnosis. Surgical repair is usually performed by neurosurgeons.</p>
			<p class="h2">Teratoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Choristomatous tumors that contain multiple tissues derived from all 3 germinal layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) are referred to as <span class="italic">teratomas.</span> Most teratomas are partially cystic, with varying fluid content. Orbital teratomas account for a very small fraction of both orbital tumors and teratomas in general. The clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of orbital teratomas may be particularly dramatic, with massive proptosis evident at birth (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-23</span>). In contrast with teratomas in other locations, which tend to show malignant growth, most orbital lesions are benign. Surgical excision, facilitated by prior aspiration of fluid, can often be accomplished without sacrificing the globe. Permanent optic nerve damage from stretching and compression may cause poor vision in the involved eye.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ec&#173;topic Lacrimal Gland</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;These are rare choristomatous lesions that may pres&#173;ent with proptosis in childhood. Cystic enlargement and chronic inflammation sometimes aggravate the condition.</p>
