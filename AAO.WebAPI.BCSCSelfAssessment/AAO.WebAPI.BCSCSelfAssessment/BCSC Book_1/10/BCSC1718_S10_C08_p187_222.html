			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Surgical treatment for glaucoma is usually undertaken when medical therapy is not appropriate, not tolerated, not effective, or not properly used by a particular patient, and the glaucoma remains uncontrolled with either documented progressive damage or a high risk of further damage. Surgery encompasses both laser and incisional procedures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Laser surgery is used as primary, adjunctive, or prophylactic treatment in various types of glaucoma. For primary angle closure, the most frequent surgeries are laser iridotomy and laser iridoplasty to widen the angle and, less commonly, laser trabeculoplasty and cyclodestruction to lower intraocular pressure (IOP). In open-&#173;angle glaucoma, laser trabeculoplasty is most frequently used to lower IOP, but cyclodestruction can also be used in select cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Incisional surgery is the first-line treatment for primary congenital glaucoma. For most other types of glaucoma, a trial of medication and/or laser surgery is first attempted to control IOP. The clinician must exercise caution when recommending incisional surgery because potential adverse effects (infections, hypotony, cataracts) can result in vision loss. Early studies of trabeculectomy as initial therapy for glaucoma, which were performed before the introduction of contemporary glaucoma medications, suggested that trabeculectomy might offer some advantages—better control of IOP, reduction in the number of patient visits to the physician, and possibly better preservation of the visual field, for example. The results of the Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS; see Chapter&#160;4) confirmed that initial surgical therapy achieves better IOP control than does initial medical therapy. However, this finding did not translate to better visual field stabilization on average because subjects who received initial surgical treatment had a higher risk of cataract in the long term. In both groups, there was a low incidence of visual field progression. However, the 9-year follow-&#173;up data showed that initial surgery led to less visual field progression than did initial medical therapy in subjects with advanced visual field loss at baseline, whereas subjects with diabetes mellitus had more visual field loss over time if treated initially with surgery. Based on the results of this study and on current practice, most clinicians defer incisional surgery for primary open-&#173;angle glaucoma (POAG) unless initial treatment with medical and/or laser therapy fails. Surgical treatment can be accelerated in patients with advanced visual field loss at presentation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When surgery is indicated, the clinical setting must guide selection of the appropriate procedure. Each of the many possible procedures is appropriate in specific conditions and clinical situations.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Laser Trabeculoplasty</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Laser trabeculoplasty (LTP) involves application of laser energy to the trabecular meshwork in discrete spots, usually covering 180°–360° per treatment. The goal of LTP is to increase outflow facility and thus reduce IOP. Different laser wavelengths and delivery systems can be used, including argon laser, diode laser, and Q-switched Nd:YAG laser.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Glaucoma Laser Trial (GLT) was a multicenter randomized clinical trial that assessed the efficacy and safety of argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) as an alternative to topical medical therapy in patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated POAG. The study was flawed in that one eye was assigned to ALT and the fellow eye was assigned to timolol treatment, which can have an effect on the contralateral ALT eye and confound the study results. Within the first 2&#160;years of follow-&#173;up, ALT as initial therapy appeared to be as effective as medication. However, more than half of the eyes treated initially with laser required the addition of one or more medications to control IOP over the course of the study.</p>
			<p class="h3">Mechanism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several mechanisms of action were initially proposed for the increased outflow facility that occurs following successful LTP. In ALT specifically, thermal damage to the treated trabecular meshwork causes shrinkage of collagen fibers and therefore stretching and widening of adjacent areas to allow for more outflow. In all forms of LTP, most investigators believe that chemical mediators, specifically interleukin-1<span class="greek--tx-">b</span> and tumor necrosis factor-<span class="greek--tx-">a</span>, are released from treated trabecular meshwork cells, increasing outflow facility through induction of specific matrix metalloproteinases. The energy of the frequency-&#173;doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser used in selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) is selectively absorbed by pigmented trabecular cells, sparing adjacent cells and tissue from thermal damage. The number of monocytes and macrophages in the trabecular meshwork increases substantially after SLT, and this increase may play a role in lowering IOP.</p>

			<p class="h3">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many clinicians use medical therapy before advancing to LTP, but LTP is a reasonable initial step in the management of glaucoma and ocular hypertension (discussed in Chapter&#160;4). In addition, patients who cannot tolerate or adhere to initial medical therapy may be candidates for LTP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Multiple prospective studies have demonstrated that ALT and SLT achieve similar pressure lowering. The IOP-&#173;lowering effect of LTP is similar to that of prostaglandin analogues, with LTP expected to lower IOP by 20%–25%. LTP effectively reduces IOP in POAG, pigmentary glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, and corticosteroid-&#173;induced glaucoma. Aphakic and pseudophakic eyes may respond to LTP less favorably than phakic eyes. IOP control is unlikely to be diminished by subsequent cataract extraction. LTP is not effective for treating certain types of secondary glaucoma, such as uveitic glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="h3">Contraindications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">LTP is not advised in patients with inflammatory glaucoma, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome, neovascular glaucoma, synechial angle closure, or developmental glaucoma. LTP can be tried in angle recession, but the underlying tissue alterations may cause the procedure to be ineffective. Another relative contraindication for LTP is the lack of effect in the fellow eye. If an eye has advanced damage and high IOP, LTP is unlikely to achieve the target pressure (see Chapter&#160;7 for discussion of target pressure).</p>
			<p class="h3">Preoperative evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As with all ocular surgery, the preoperative evaluation recommended for LTP includes a detailed medical and ocular history and a comprehensive eye examination. Particular attention must be paid to visual field examination, gonioscopy, and optic nerve evaluation; the trabecular meshwork must be visible on gonioscopy. The degree of pigmentation <br />in the angle determines the power setting: the more pigmented the trabecular meshwork, the less energy required.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In ALT, a 50-µm laser beam of 0.1-second duration is focused through a goniolens at the junction of the anterior nonpigmented and the posterior pigmented edge of the trabecular meshwork (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-1</span>). Application to the posterior trabecular meshwork tends to result in inflammation, pigment dispersion, prolonged IOP elevation, and peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) formation. The power setting (300–1000&#160;mW) should be titrated to achieve the desired endpoint, which is blanching of the trabecular meshwork or production of a tiny bubble. If a large bubble appears, the power is reduced and titrated to achieve the proper effect. As LTP was originally described, laser energy was applied to the entire circumference (360°) of the trabecular meshwork. But evidence suggests that a satisfactory reduction in IOP is achieved in many eyes and there is a lower risk of short-term pressure elevation when only half of the circumference is treated, with approximately 40–50&#160;applications over 180° of the meshwork.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The procedure with the diode laser is similar: a 50–75-µm laser beam is focused through a goniolens with a power setting of 600–1000&#160;mW and duration of 0.1&#160;second.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In SLT, the laser targets intracellular melanin. A frequency-&#173;doubled (532-nm) Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with a fixed 400-µm spot size is used to deliver 0.4–1.5&#160;mJ of energy per spot for 3.0&#160;ns, titrated to the appearance of bubbles. Results of clinical studies suggest that the procedure is safe and effective, with IOP-&#173;lowering effects similar to those achieved with ALT. Histologic studies have shown that treatment with SLT causes less coagulative damage to and fewer structural changes in the trabecular meshwork compared with treatment with ALT.</p>

			<p class="h3">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common complication of LTP is a transient rise in IOP, which occurs in approximately 20% of patients. IOP has been reported to reach 50–60&#160;mm Hg, and this transient rise may cause additional damage to the optic nerve and visual field. This rise is less common when only 180° of the angle is treated per session.</p>
			<p class="body-text">IOP elevations are of particular concern in patients with advanced glaucoma. Rises in IOP are usually evident by the first hour postoperatively. The adjunctive use of topical apraclonidine or brimonidine has been shown to blunt postoperative pressure elevation. Other medications shown to blunt these IOP spikes include <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers, pilocarpine, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs). Hyperosmotic agents and oral CAIs may be helpful in eyes with IOP spikes not responsive to topical medications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Low-grade anterior uveitis may follow LTP. Some surgeons routinely prescribe a course of topical anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs for 4–7&#160;days after LTP; others use them only if inflammation develops. PAS may occur after ALT. Other rare complications of LTP include hyphema, corneal inflammation and edema (similar to the diffuse lamellar keratitis seen after corneal refractive surgery), reactivation of herpes simplex virus, and persistently elevated IOP requiring incisional surgery.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Results and long-term follow-up</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For follow-&#173;up, the surgeon should allow 4–6&#160;weeks before evaluating the full effect of treatment and deciding whether additional treatment is necessary. Approximately 80% of patients with medically uncontrolled open-&#173;angle glaucoma experience a drop in IOP for a minimum of 6–12&#160;months following LTP. Longer-&#173;term data have shown that 50% of patients with an initial response maintain a significantly lower IOP level for 3–5&#160;years after treatment. The success rate at 10&#160;years is approximately 30%. The highest success rates are seen in older patients with POAG and in pseudoexfoliation glaucoma. Eyes with pigmentary glaucoma may show a good initial decrease in IOP, but with continued pigment shedding, this may not be sustained.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Elevation of IOP may recur in some patients after months or even&#160;years of control. Additional laser treatment may be helpful in some patients, especially if the entire angle has not been treated previously. Re-treatment of an angle that has been fully treated (approximately 80–100&#160;applications over 360°) has a lower success rate and a higher complication rate than does primary treatment. Also, the effect after re-&#173;treatment may not be as long lasting as that of the first treatment.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Laser Iridotomy</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Iridotomy is performed for pupillary block resulting in primary angle closure (PAC) or acute PAC (see Chapter&#160;5). For the PAC suspect (PACS), the use of iridotomy varies widely; experts disagree on the threshold indications at which an iridotomy should be performed. Iridotomy provides an alternate route for aqueous trapped in the posterior chamber to enter the anterior chamber, which then allows the iris to recede from its occlusion of the trabecular meshwork (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-2</span>). Sometimes it is necessary to perform iridotomy for diagnostic purposes. For example, the diagnosis of plateau iris syndrome is confirmed only when a patent iridotomy fails to change the peripheral iris configuration and relieve angle closure.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Contraindications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A laser iridotomy is not recommended in the case of a completely flat anterior chamber because of the risk of corneal endothelial damage. An opacified or edematous cornea precludes an adequate view. Once 360° of synechial angle closure has occurred, iridotomy offers no benefit. Angle closure from mechanisms other than pupillary block also does not require iridotomy (ie, neovascular glaucoma and iridocorneal endothelial syndrome). An eye with active rubeosis iridis may bleed and develop a large hyphema following laser iridotomy. The risk of bleeding is also increased in a patient taking systemic anticoagulants, including aspirin. The risk of hyphema can be reduced by pretreating dark irides with an argon or diode laser prior to penetration with Nd:YAG laser and/or by coagulating an actively bleeding blood vessel with argon or diode laser.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Preoperative considerations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In acute angle closure, performing laser iridotomy is often difficult due to the cloudy cornea, shallow chamber, and engorged iris that are present in this condition. Before proceeding to surgery, the clinician should attempt to acutely lower the IOP medically with topical medications, intravenous CAIs, or osmotics, which will help clear the cornea and make the patient more comfortable. In some countries, the IOP is initially lowered with a careful paracentesis in addition to medication. Corneal edema may be improved prior to laser iridotomy by pretreatment with topical glycerin. In prophylactic iridotomies, pretreatment with pilocarpine may be helpful by stretching and thinning the iris. Pretreatment with apraclonidine or brimonidine can help blunt IOP spikes. The patient should be asked about anticoagulants, as their use increases the risk of hyphema.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Laser iridotomies can be performed with the Nd:YAG laser, argon laser, diode laser, or a combination of diode/Nd:YAG or argon/Nd:YAG lasers. For the combined procedure, the argon or diode laser is used first to thin iris tissue and coagulate underlying blood vessels, and then the Nd:YAG laser is used to penetrate the iris. Typical settings for the argon pretreatment are 0.1&#160;seconds, 50-µm spot size, and 900&#160;mW, while the Nd:YAG settings are 2–5&#160;mJ. The surgeon should plan to place the iridotomy in the far periphery of the superior iris, where it will be covered by eyelid, if possible, or at the 3- or 9-o’clock position, to decrease the chances of linear dysphotopsias. It is easiest to penetrate the iris through a crypt.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nd:YAG iridotomy alone is preferred for many eyes. In general, fewer pulses and less energy is needed to create a patent iridotomy with the Nd:YAG laser alone than with an argon-&#173;alone laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI). Also, the effectiveness of the Nd:YAG laser is not affected by iris color, and the iridotomy created by this laser does not close as often over the long term as one created by argon laser. With a condensing contact lens, the typical initial setting for the Nd:YAG laser is 2–8&#160;mJ. Potential complications include disruption of the anterior lens capsule or corneal endothelium, bleeding (usually transient), postoperative spike in IOP, inflammation, and delayed closure of the iridotomy. To prevent damage to the lens, the surgeon must use caution with the Nd:YAG laser when further enlarging the opening once patency has been established.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The argon laser alone can be used for performing iridotomy in most eyes, but very dark and very light irides present technical challenges. With an LPI-&#173;specific condensing contact lens in place, the procedure is done in 2&#160;steps: the first step contracts tissue, and the second penetrates it. The typical initial argon laser settings are 0.2–0.5&#160;seconds of duration, 200–500-µm spot size, and 200–400&#160;mW for up to 5&#160;shots; the subsequent laser settings are 0.1&#160;second of duration, 50-µm spot size, and 800–1000&#160;mW for up to 300&#160;shots. There are variations in technique, and iris color dictates which technique is chosen. Complications include localized lens opacity, acute rise in IOP (which may damage the optic nerve), transient or persistent anterior uveitis, early closure of the iridotomy, posterior synechiae, and corneal and retinal burns.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Postoperative care</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Bleeding may occur from the iridotomy site, particularly with use of the Nd:YAG laser. Often, compression of the eye with the laser lens will provide a tamponade for the vessel, thereby slowing bleeding until coagulation can occur. In rare cases when this does not work, it may be helpful to use an argon laser to coagulate the vessel. If postoperative spikes in IOP occur, as with LTP, they are treated as described in the section Laser Trabeculoplasty. Topical corticosteroids are usually prescribed for 1&#160;week, longer if necessary, as prophylaxis against inflammation.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Laser Gonioplasty, or Peripheral Iridoplasty</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Gonioplasty, or iridoplasty, is a technique to deepen the angle. It is primarily used in persistent appositional angle-&#173;closure glaucoma after successful iridotomy in cases of plateau iris syndrome, nanophthalmos, and lens-&#173;related angle-&#173;closure. It is also used in cases of acute angle closure in which a shallow chamber precludes iridotomy. Stromal burns are made in the peripheral iris with the argon laser to cause contraction and flattening, thereby pulling the iris away from the angle.</p>
			<p class="h3">Contraindications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The contraindications for gonioplasty are similar to those for laser iridotomy but also include tumors of the iris or ciliary body and uveitis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Preoperative considerations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An angle that is appositionally closed from plateau iris syndrome will not open after laser iridotomy because forward displacement of the ciliary processes pushes the peripheral iris into the drainage angle.</p>
			<p class="h3">Technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Long duration and large spot size with relatively low power is necessary to cause a contraction burn that will thin peripheral iris and pull it out of the angle. Pilocarpine is given preoperatively to maximally stretch the iris, and a contact lens with a gonioscopy mirror is placed on the eye. Typical laser settings for the argon green laser are 0.5&#160;second of duration, 200–500-µm spot size, and 200–400&#160;mW of power. The time and energy can be titrated based on immediate response.</p>

			<p class="h3">Postoperative considerations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Elevated IOP may occur in the postoperative period and should be monitored, as is done after other laser procedures. Anisocoria, iris pigment changes, and corneal endothelial damage can occur. Postoperative anterior uveitis is common and should be treated with topical corticosteroids.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Cyclodestruction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several surgical procedures reduce aqueous secretion and thus decrease IOP by destroying a portion of the ciliary body. Cyclocryotherapy, thermal lasers, such as continuous-&#173;wave Nd:YAG, argon, and diode lasers (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-3</span>), have been used to inhibit the secretory activity of the ciliary epithelium. Cyclocryotherapy, in which the ciliary body is frozen, and Nd:YAG cyclodestruction were associated with high rates of hypotony and phthisis bulbi. The most common modalities in current practice are endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation and diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. <span class="italic">Endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation</span> is an intraocular procedure in which a microendoscope applies laser energy to the ciliary processes under direct visualization. In <span class="italic">transscleral cyclophotocoagulation,</span> the laser probe is placed externally, which focuses the beam across the sclera to cause destruction of the underlying ciliary body and ciliary epithelium. The risk of hypotony and phthisis bulbi is much lower with these latter modalities (unless the eyes are ischemic), and these modalities have been safely used in eyes with good vision.</p>
			<p class="h3">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Traditionally, cyclodestruction has been used to lower IOP in eyes that have poor visual potential or that are poor candidates for incisional outflow surgery. The procedure is useful in all types of glaucoma, and it can be considered for elderly patients when other glaucoma surgeries are refused or not possible because of poor systemic health. Diode laser transscleral cyclodestruction is used by some clinicians for lowering the IOP in painful blind eyes (no light perception) or in eyes that have exhausted outflow procedures. Other interventions available for blind eyes are retrobulbar alcohol injection, retrobulbar chlorpromazine injection, or enucleation. Endoscopic cyclodestruction is used in eyes with better visual potential because there is less damage to the ciliary body.</p>
			<p class="h3">Contraindications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">External cyclodestruction is relatively contraindicated in eyes with good vision because of a moderately high rate of phthisis bulbi and hypotony reported in the literature, although these risks are highest in eyes with a history of neovascular glaucoma. There is also the risk of loss of visual acuity from macular edema. Endoscopic cyclodestruction, an incisional surgery, is contraindicated in blind eyes because of the small risk of sympathetic ophthalmia.</p>
			<p class="h3">Preoperative considerations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The preoperative evaluation for cyclodestructive procedures is the same as that for incisional glaucoma surgery. Many surgeons choose to perform transscleral cyclodestruction with sedation to make the patient comfortable during the sub-&#173;Tenon, peribulbar or retrobulbar block, although the block and transscleral cyclodestruction can be performed in a nonsterile setting without sedation. Endoscopic cyclodestruction requires a sterile operating room because it is an intraocular procedure.</p>
			<p class="h3">Techniques</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation are replacing cyclocryotherapy and Nd:YAG cyclodestruction, as they are better tolerated and cause less pain and inflammation. Although there is a degree of unpredictability with diode laser cyclodestruction, this method is considerably more predictable in effect than its predecessors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In transscleral cyclodestruction, the patient is given a local block for anesthesia. The laser energy is delivered via a probe placed on the sclera over the pars plicata. Transillumination should be used if the anatomy is distorted, as in buphthalmic eyes. Each laser application is of long duration (2–4&#160;seconds) and the energy varies (750–2000&#160;mW) depending on the pigmentation of the eye. If tissue disruption is heard via a popping noise, energy should be lowered. The number of applications varies (14–24 on average) and spans 180°–360°. One should avoid the 3- and 9-o’clock positions where the ciliary nerves enter the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In endoscopic cyclodestruction, a sterile surgical field is required, along with a local block for anesthesia. A clear cornea or pars plana incision with vitrectomy is made to accommodate the probe, which is simultaneously used to visualize and treat the ciliary processes until they shrink and turn white. The laser energy is continuous and constant, as long as the probe is held the same distance from the processes. A phakic eye is a relative contraindication to the endoscopic approach.</p>
			<p class="h3">Postoperative management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pain after external cyclodestruction may be substantial. Patients should receive adequate analgesics, including narcotics, during the immediate postoperative period. Cycloplegics, corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory agents are prescribed for discomfort and inflammation and tapered as the clinical picture allows. IOP-&#173;lowering drops are continued until the IOP-&#173;lowering effect of cyclodestruction is observed.</p>
			<p class="h3">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cyclodestructive procedures may result in prolonged hypotony, pain, inflammation, cystoid macular edema, hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and even phthisis bulbi. Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare but serious complication. Endophthalmitis is a risk with the endoscopic approach.</p>

			<div id="Chapt8_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most frequently performed incisional surgeries for glaucoma are trabeculectomy and implantation of tube shunts. These procedures can decrease IOP significantly because they create a pathway that bypasses the eye’s natural outflow pathways, but they also carry significant risk of complications. They are the procedures of choice for moderate to severe cases of open-&#173;angle and angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. There are several procedures that allow for nonpenetrating and/or minimally invasive surgery. These procedures enhance the eye’s natural outflow pathway and have a better safety profile than trabeculectomy and tube shunts. However, they tend to lower IOP less effectively. The nonpenetrating and minimally invasive surgeries are used to treat open-&#173;angle glaucoma at an earlier stage. Cataract surgery alone can decrease IOP in certain eyes, particularly those with high IOP associated with narrow angles from a large lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Trabeculectomy (and its variations) and tube shunt surgery are indicated when other therapies cannot maintain the IOP at a level considered low enough to prevent further disease progression. The glaucoma may be uncontrolled for various reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-11">Maximally tolerated medical therapy and laser surgery (trabeculoplasty, iridotomy, and/or iridoplasty/gonioplasty, when indicated) fail to adequately reduce IOP.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Glaucomatous optic neuropathy or visual field loss is progressing despite apparent “adequate” reduction of IOP with medical therapy (with or without laser surgery).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-12">The patient cannot adhere to the necessary medical regimen.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Trabeculectomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The trabeculectomy is a fistulizing procedure. It creates a new pathway (fistula) that allows aqueous humor to flow out of the anterior chamber through a surgical corneoscleral opening and into the subconjunctival and the sub-&#173;Tenon space. In the contemporary trabeculectomy, the fistula is created under a partial-&#173;thickness flap. The procedure is traditionally referred to as <span class="italic">filtering surgery</span> even though there is no filtering action.</p>
			<p class="h3">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Incisional surgery is indicated when maximally tolerated core medical therapy and laser treatment fail or are insufficient to prevent progressive damage. However, because of the potential complications of incisional glaucoma surgery (discussed later), it is not reasonable to perform trabeculectomy in an eye with ocular hypertension and a low risk of developing functional loss. In less clear-cut situations—for example, when one&#160;eye has sustained significant glaucomatous damage and the IOP is high in the fellow eye despite maximally tolerated medical therapy—some surgeons would recommend surgery prior to unequivocal detection of damage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Failure of medical therapy may be the result of poor patient adherence, in itself a relative indication for surgery. Some patients may use their medications only shortly before an office visit. Thus, there may be progression despite apparently acceptable IOP. It is difficult to elicit an accurate history in this situation. When the ophthalmologist suspects poor patient adherence, it may be appropriate to advance to surgery sooner, because further changes in medical therapy are unlikely to improve IOP control.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The main indications for surgery are progression of visual field damage and uncontrolled IOP. Multiple visual field examinations may be required in order to confirm progression. In many cases, the decision to proceed with surgery is made even in the absence of documented progression and is based on a clinical judgment that the IOP is too high for the stage of the disease. Thus, an IOP of 25&#160;mm Hg is not an indication for surgery in an eye with ocular hypertension, but this IOP level might be an indication for IOP-&#173;lowering surgery in the setting of advanced glaucomatous optic neuropathy. It is not always necessary to perform LTP before proceeding to trabeculectomy.</p>

			<p class="h3">Contraindications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Relative contraindications for trabeculectomy can be ocular or systemic. A blind eye is not considered for incisional surgery. Cyclodestruction is a better alternative for lowering IOP in such eyes. The risk of sympathetic ophthalmia should always be kept in mind when any procedure on a blind eye or an eye with poor visual potential is considered. Conditions that predispose to trabeculectomy failure, such as active anterior segment neovascularization (rubeosis iridis) or active anterior uveitis, are relative contraindications. The underlying problem should be addressed first, if possible, or a surgical alternative such as implantation of a tube shunt should be considered. It may be extremely difficult to perform a successful trabeculectomy in an eye that has sustained extensive conjunctival injury (eg, after retinal detachment surgery or chemical trauma) or that has an extremely thin sclera from prior surgery or necrotizing scleritis. In such cases the likelihood of success is also reduced because of an increased risk of scarring.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The success rate of trabeculectomy is lower in younger patients or in aphakic or pseudophakic patients who have had cataract extraction through a scleral tunnel incision. However, with the advent of clear cornea phacoemulsification for cataract extraction and the use of antifibrotic agents during trabeculectomy, surgery has resulted in significant improvements in IOP in pseudophakic patients. A lower success rate is also found in patients with certain types of secondary glaucoma and in those who previously had unsuccessful filtering procedures. In addition, black patients have a higher failure rate with filtering surgery.</p>

			<p class="h3">Preoperative evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When considering a surgical procedure, the ophthalmologist must take into account factors such as the patient’s general health, presumed life expectancy, and status of the fellow eye. The patient must be medically stable enough to endure an invasive ocular procedure under local anesthesia. The preoperative evaluation should determine and document factors that may affect surgical planning, as well as those that determine the structural and functional status of the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Control of preoperative inflammation with corticosteroids helps reduce postoperative anterior uveitis and scarring of the filtering bleb. Discontinuation of anticholinesterase agents (in the rare instances when they are used), with temporary use of alternative medications, at least 3–6&#160;weeks before surgery helps reduce bleeding and iridocyclitis. If there is an allergic dermatoconjunctivitis with severe inflammation, stopping all offending topical drops and controlling IOP with oral CAIs temporarily can be helpful. Blepharitis should be controlled preoperatively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Before surgery, the IOP should be reduced as closely as possible to normal levels in order to minimize the risk of expulsive choroidal hemorrhage. If possible, discontinue antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications, in consultation with the patient’s primary care physician. Systemic hypertension should be controlled.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients should be informed of the purpose of and expectations for surgery: to arrest or delay progressive vision loss caused by their glaucoma. They should understand that glaucoma surgery alone rarely improves vision and that glaucoma medications may still need to be used postoperatively; that surgery may fail completely; that they could lose vision as a result of surgery; and that glaucoma may progress despite successful surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is important to note that a patient with very advanced visual field loss or field loss that is impinging on fixation is at risk, in rare instances, of loss of central acuity after a surgical procedure. The most common cause of vision loss after trabeculectomy is cataract development. Hypotony maculopathy and cystoid macular edema may also cause vision loss. Loss of central vision in the absence of other explanations (“wipeout”) may occur, but only in rare instances. Advanced age, preoperative visual field with macular splitting, and early postoperative hypotony are risk factors for wipeout. Early, undetected, postoperative elevation of IOP may also be associated with wipeout. Bleb infections and endophthalmitis may occur long after filtering surgery and may also cause vision loss.</p>

			<p class="h3">Trabeculectomy technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Knowledge of the internal and external anatomy of the limbal area is essential for successful surgery. Trabeculectomy is a guarded partial-&#173;thickness filtering procedure in which a block of peripheral corneoscleral tissue is removed beneath a scleral flap (Video&#160;8-1). The scleral flap provides resistance and limits the outflow of aqueous, thereby reducing the complications associated with early hypotony, such as flat anterior chamber, cataract, serous choroidal effusion and hemorrhagic choroidal detachment, hypotony maculopathy, and optic nerve edema. The use of antifibrotic agents (discussed in more detail later), such as mitomycin&#160;C (MMC) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), along with releasable sutures or laser suture lysis, prolongs the duration of successful IOP control.</p>

			<p class="body-text">In contrast to cataract surgery, the success of trabeculectomy is largely dependent on timely postoperative interventions that modulate wound healing of the filter site to achieve appropriate flow through the artificial aqueous outflow pathway. The goal of this procedure is complete healing of the conjunctival incision, without scarring of the scleral flap to the scleral bed and without excessive subconjunctival scarring.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A trabeculectomy can be broken down into several basic steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-14"><span class="italic">Exposure:</span> A corneal or limbal traction suture can rotate the globe downward, providing excellent exposure of the superior sulcus and limbus, which can be very helpful for a limbus-&#173;based conjunctival flap (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-4</span>). A superior rectus bridle suture has the same effect but is more likely to cause postoperative ptosis and subconjunctival hemorrhage. The speculum should be adjusted to keep pressure off the globe.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Conjunctival incision:</span> Traditionally, the trabeculectomy has been positioned at the 12&#160;o’clock meridian or in either superior quadrant, depending on surgeon preference. There is evidence that with the use of antifibrotic agents, the trabeculectomy bleb should be positioned at the 12&#160;o’clock meridian to reduce the risk of bleb exposure and dysesthesia. A fornix- or limbus-&#173;based conjunctival flap can be used (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;8-5, 8-6</span>). Each technique has advantages and disadvantages. The fornix-&#173;based flap is easier to fashion but requires very careful suturing to achieve a watertight closure at the end of the procedure. The advantage of a fornix-&#173;based conjunctival flap is the development of a subconjunctival scar anterior to the scleral flap, which encourages posterior aqueous flow and formation of a more posterior bleb. The limbus-&#173;based conjunctival flap is technically more challenging, but it permits a secure closure well away from the limbus. The incision should be positioned 8–10&#160;mm posterior to the limbus, and care should be taken to avoid the tendon of the superior rectus muscle. The advantage of a limbus-&#173;based flap is that it has a reduced risk of postoperative incision leakage; a potential disadvantage is the possible creation of a subconjunctival scar posterior to the scleral flap, impeding posterior flow of aqueous and encouraging more localized bleb formation closer to the limbus.<p class="bullet-list-cont _idGenParaOverride-1">The clinical situation will influence the placement of the conjunctival incision. For instance, in deep-set eyes with tight orbits, it may be anatomically difficult to create a limbus-&#173;based conjunctival flap. For a patient traveling long distances for postoperative care, the surgeon may elect to create a limbus-&#173;based conjunctival flap, reducing the risk of postoperative incision leakage and the number of postoperative visits that would be required to treat it.</p></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Scleral flap:</span> The scleral flap and its relationship to the underlying sclerostomy (discussed later) provide resistance to outflow; the specific size and shape of the flap are not critical. Flap design varies according to surgeon preference, but a common technique involves creating a 3- to 4-mm triangular, trapezoidal, or rectangular flap (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-7</span>). If a fornix-&#173;based conjunctival flap is used, it is best to avoid dissecting the flap anteriorly into clear cornea, because anterior flap dissection facilitates early wound leakage.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Paracentesis</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-8</span>): To enable the surgeon to control the anterior chamber, a paracentesis should be performed next. This allows instillation of balanced salt ophthalmic solution or viscoelastic and intraoperative testing of the patency of the filtration site. Balanced salt ophthalmic solution is instilled through the paracentesis incision, and suture tension is titrated until flow is minimal. If a postoperative flat chamber occurs, the paracentesis is already in place and can be used to re-form the chamber. Using the existing paracentesis is much safer than trying to create a paracentesis in an eye with a flat chamber.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Keratectomy:</span> In a strict sense, the term <span class="italic">trabeculectomy</span> is inaccurate because peripheral posterior cornea rather than trabecular meshwork is removed in this procedure. There is no advantage to extending the block posteriorly into sclera, and the risk of bleeding from the iris root and ciliary body is greater. The keratectomy is commonly performed with the use of a punch, although a block may also be cut with a fine blade (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-9</span>). Aqueous drainage is generally not restricted by the size of the opening. A very small hole can drain more aqueous than is required to control IOP. However, the keratectomy must be large enough to avoid occlusion by iris, but small enough so that it is overlapped on all sides by scleral flap. Insertion of a small titanium shunt under the flap, in lieu of a keratectomy can standardize the size of the hole for drainage and avoid a freehand keratectomy. More overlap, a thicker flap, and tighter sutures are generally associated with less flow; the converse is also true.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Iridectomy:</span> An iridectomy is performed to reduce the risk of iris occluding the sclerostomy, especially in phakic and narrow-&#173;angle eyes, and to prevent pupillary block (see Fig&#160;8-9D). An iridectomy may not always be necessary in pseudophakic eyes with deep anterior chambers. Care should be taken to avoid amputation of the ciliary processes or disruption of the zonular fibers or hyaloid face. If a titanium shunt is inserted under the flap, an iridectomy is not necessary.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Closure of scleral flap:</span> The flap is reapproximated to its bed with 10-0 or 9-0 nylon (Fig 8-10). With the advent of laser suture lysis and releasable sutures (discussed later under “Flap management”), many surgeons close the flap more tightly, thereby minimizing postoperative shallowing of the anterior chamber. After a few&#160;days or&#160;weeks, these techniques can release tension on the flap and promote flow. It is important to test the integrity of the scleral flap before closing the conjunctiva. When MMC is used, tension and number of sutures should be adjusted until optimal spontaneous flow can be seen. To ensure that suture adjustment will further increase outflow, the surgeon can test the flow. It should be possible to induce additional flow with gentle depression of the posterior scleral lip.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-12"><span class="italic">Closure of conjunctiva:</span> Many techniques have been developed for conjunctival closure (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-11</span>). It is imperative that the closure be watertight at the completion of the procedure. For a fornix-&#173;based flap, conjunctiva is secured at the limbus. Several techniques are used for this closure, including episcleral-anchored interrupted sutures at each end of the incision; a running mattress suture; and purse-string closures at each end of the incision, with or without mattress sutures in between. For a limbus-&#173;based flap, conjunctiva and Tenon capsule are closed separately or in a single layer with a running suture of 9-0 nylon or polyglactin&#160;910 on a vascular needle, which minimizes wound leak in procedures where MMC has been applied.<p class="reference-single ParaOverride-15">Jones E, Clarke J, Khaw PT. Recent advances in trabeculectomy technique. <span class="italic">Curr Opin Ophthalmol.</span> 2005;16(2):107–113.</p></li>

			<p class="h3">Antifibrotic agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The application of antifibrotic agents such as 5-FU and MMC results in lower IOP following trabeculectomy. However, the rate of serious postoperative complications may be higher, and these agents must not be used indiscriminately. Because their use is associated with an increased risk of hypotony maculopathy, antifibrotic agents should be used with caution in primary trabeculectomies on young patients with myopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The pyrimidine analogue 5-FU reversibly inhibits fibroblast proliferation and has proven useful in reducing scarring after filtering surgery. The agent undergoes intracellular conversion to the active deoxynucleotide 5-fluoro-2<span class="math">′</span>-deoxyuridine &#173;5<span class="math">′</span>-monophosphate (FdUMP), which interferes with DNA synthesis through its action on thymidylate <br />synthetase.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although 5-FU was originally advocated for use in high-risk groups such as patients with aphakic or pseudophakic eyes, neovascular glaucoma, or a history of failed operations, many surgeons now use 5-FU on a routine basis. This agent can be used intraoperatively (50&#160;mg/mL on a surgical sponge) in a fashion similar to that described next for MMC. Regimens for postoperative administration vary according to the observed healing response. Individual doses of 5–10&#160;mg in 0.1–0.5&#160;mL can be injected. The total dose can be titrated to the observed healing response and corneal toxicity. Complications such as corneal epithelial defects commonly occur and require discontinuation of 5-FU injections. The site of the 5-FU injection can be varied: either 180° away from the trabeculectomy site or in the upper fornix adjacent to the bleb. As this agent is highly alkaline, the surgeon should avoid injecting 5-FU close to the scleral flap to reduce the risk of intraocular exposure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Derived from <span class="italic">Streptomyces caespitosus,</span> MMC is a naturally occurring compound with antibiotic and antineoplastic activities. It acts as an alkylating agent after enzyme activation, resulting in DNA crosslinking. MMC is a potent antifibrotic agent that is most commonly administered intraoperatively in the following manner: a surgical sponge soaked in MMC is placed within the subconjunctival space so that it is in contact with sclera at the planned trabeculectomy site. Concentrations in current usage are typically 0.1–0.5&#160;mg/mL with a duration of application from 0.5 to 5&#160;minutes. Most surgeons use the higher concentrations for shorter durations and vice versa. Few data are available to compare regimens, and most surgeons increase concentration or duration based on risk factors for trabeculectomy failure. The technique of MMC application has evolved to cover a larger area with increased posterior exposure in an attempt to develop a more diffuse, low-&#173;lying bleb (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-12</span>) instead of a localized, elevated bleb (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-13</span>), which is inherently at greater risk of infection. Alternatively, instead of using a pledget, many surgeons inject MMC subconjunctivally before surgery to achieve a diffuse application. Doses ranging from 5 to 30&#160;µg have been used. Because MMC is toxic and highly mutagenic, intracameral exposure must be avoided.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-16">Flap management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Techniques allowing tighter initial closure of the scleral flap help prevent early postoperative hypotony. Two of these techniques are the use of releasable flap sutures (Video&#160;8-2) and the placement of additional sutures that can be cut postoperatively to facilitate outflow following trabeculectomy. In laser suture lysis (LSL), the conjunctiva is compressed with either a Zeiss goniolens or a lens designed for suture lysis (such as a Hoskins, Ritch, Mandelkorn, or Blumenthal lens), and the argon green laser (set at 240–600&#160;mW at a duration of 0.02–0.1&#160;second with a spot size of 50–100&#160;µm) or red laser can usually lyse the selected black 10-0 nylon suture with one application. It is important to avoid creating a full-&#173;thickness conjunctival burn. Shorter duration of laser energy and avoidance of pigment or blood are helpful for preventing such a burn. Most surgeons wait at least 48&#160;hours before performing LSL. Filtration is best enhanced if lysis or suture release is completed within 2–4&#160;weeks of the surgery or before the occurrence of flap fibrosis. This period may be lengthened to several months when antifibrotic agents have been used.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Postoperative considerations in trabeculectomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The success of glaucoma surgery depends on careful postoperative management. In general, glaucoma medications are stopped for the surgical eye. If oral CAIs are discontinued, an adjustment in medication may be necessary for the fellow eye. Topical corticosteroids are typically administered intensively (at least 4&#160;times daily) initially and tapered as the clinical course dictates. Topical antibiotics or cycloplegic agents may also be used. Topical corticosteroids should be tapered according to the degree of conjunctival hyperemia, which may continue for 2&#160;months or more, rather than in response to the visible anterior chamber reaction, which usually resolves more quickly. Long-term use of prophylactic antibiotics is generally not recommended. Trabeculectomies require intensive early postoperative care, and frequent office visits are necessary in the first postoperative month. During this period, if the IOP is above target, it is common for the clinician to do the following: prescribe digital ocular pressure (for 2&#160;seconds a pulse in multiples of 3–10&#160;twice daily); administer 5-FU injections; and/or lyse permanent sutures or remove releasable sutures. An advantage of frequent visits in the early postoperative period is that if hypotony or a flat chamber occurs, it will not go undiagnosed for a prolonged period.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Complications of trabeculectomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Early and late complications of filtering surgery are listed in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;8-1</span>. Early complications include wound leaks at incision sites, hypotony, shallow or flat anterior chamber, and serous or hemorrhagic choroidal effusions. Late complications include blebitis, bleb-&#173;related endophthalmitis, bleb leakage, hypotony and associated maculopathy or choroidal hemorrhage, bleb failure, overhanging blebs, painful blebs, ptosis, and eyelid retraction. The filtering bleb can leak, produce dellen, or expand so as to interfere with eyelid function or extend onto the cornea and interfere with vision or cause irritation. Blebs may also encapsulate or fibrose, causing elevated IOP. Filtering blebs are dynamic; they evolve over time and must be monitored. All patients must be informed of the warning signs of bleb-&#173;related infections and instructed to seek ophthalmic care immediately should they develop a red eye or other signs of infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Late-onset bleb-&#173;related endophthalmitis is a potentially devastating complication of filtering surgery. In adults, the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis associated with glaucoma surgery with or without antifibrotic drugs has been reported to range from 1.3% per patient-&#173;year for superior blebs to 7.8% per patient-&#173;year for inferior blebs. Risk factors for bleb-&#173;related endophthalmitis include blepharitis or conjunctivitis, ocular trauma, nasolacrimal duct obstruction, contact lens use, chronic bleb leak, male sex, and young age. Trabeculectomy performed at the inferior limbus is associated with an unacceptably high risk of bleb-&#173;related endophthalmitis. Use of adjunctive antifibrotic drugs such as 5-FU or MMC has been associated with an increased risk of bleb-&#173;related endophthalmitis, perhaps because these blebs are often thin-walled and avascular. Patients may present with blebitis or with blebitis and endophthalmitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-14</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hypotony after filtering surgery is usually due to overfiltration through the scleral flap and can be associated with bleb leaks. Aqueous leakage from a filtering bleb may occur as an early or late complication of surgery. Early-&#173;onset bleb leaks are usually related to ineffective wound closure or a conjunctival buttonhole. Late-&#173;onset leaks occur more frequently after full-&#173;thickness procedures such as posterior lip sclerectomy or after use of antifibrotic drugs. Untreated bleb leaks may lead to vision-&#173;threatening complications, including shallowing of the anterior chamber, PAS formation, cataract, corneal decompensation, choroidal effusion, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, endophthalmitis, and hypotony maculopathy. Clinical manifestations of hypotony maculopathy include decreased vision, hypotony, optic nerve and retinal edema, and radial folds of the macula.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Choroidal effusions are more likely to occur in elderly patients because of increased scleral rigidity, which occurs with age and does not allow sclera to buckle under low pressure. Eyes with thin, pliable sclera tend to develop hypotony maculopathy. Choroidal effusions may be treated medically with cycloplegics, with injection of a viscoelastic substance into the anterior chamber, or by choroidal drainage. Suprachoroidal fluid can be drained through one or more posterior full-&#173;thickness sclerotomies overlying the area of effusion, as the anterior chamber is deepened through a paracentesis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Numerous techniques have been described for managing bleb leaks, including the use of an oversize contact lens, aqueous suppressants, suture, tissue glue, autologous blood injection, and oral antibiotics from the tetracycline family. Excision of the bleb, in combination with a conjunctival graft or conjunctival advancement with or without a scleral graft, is also possible. The surgeon may also advance a conjunctival flap over the existing bleb. If there is undue tension during closure, conjunctival relaxing incisions and a pedicle conjunctival flap can be created to help closure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The bleb may fail following filtering surgery. In eyes with failing blebs, reduced bleb height, increased bleb-wall thickness, vascularization of the bleb, loss of conjunctival microcysts, and increased IOP may be seen. Risk factors for bleb failure include anterior segment neovascularization, black race, aphakia, prior failed filtering procedures, uveitis, prior cataract surgery, prior vitreoretinal surgery, and young age. Initial management of failing blebs often includes digital pressure. In eyes that do not respond to this initial therapy, transconjunctival needle revision may restore aqueous flow.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The use of contact lenses with a filtering bleb presents special problems. Contact lenses may be difficult to fit in the presence of a filtering bleb, or the lens may ride against the bleb, causing discomfort and increasing the risk of infection. Several options can be considered for the patient who has myopia, requires a trabeculectomy, and prefers not to or cannot wear spectacles. Clear lens extraction (either before, after, or combined with trabeculectomy) is controversial. In some circumstances, hard or soft contact lens use under close supervision may be considered after trabeculectomy. Contact lens use is more often feasible in patients after tube shunt implantation than after trabeculectomy. When an initial filtering procedure is not adequate to control the glaucoma and resumption of medical therapy is not successful, revision of original surgery, a second filtering surgery at a new site, tube shunt implantation, or possibly cyclodestructive procedures may be indicated.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Combined Cataract and Trabeculectomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Both cataract and glaucoma are conditions that are more prevalent with age. It is not surprising that many patients with glaucoma eventually develop cataracts either naturally or as a result of glaucoma therapy. It should also be noted that cataract surgery alone may lower IOP in eyes with open angles and may lower it even more in eyes with phacomorphic narrow angles. However, cataract surgery as a treatment of open-&#173;angle glaucoma is a topic of debate.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A combined procedure (cataract extraction plus trabeculectomy) may prevent a postoperative rise in IOP. Combined procedures are generally less effective than trabeculectomy alone in controlling IOP over time because the inflammation induced by cataract surgery increases the risk of bleb failure. For patients in whom glaucoma is the greatest immediate threat to vision, trabeculectomy alone is usually performed first.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several clinical challenges are common in patients with coexisting cataract and glaucoma. Medical therapy for glaucoma may create chronic miosis, and the surgeon must deal with a small pupil. The anterior chamber can be very shallow in eyes with angle closure, making cataract surgery technically difficult. In patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome, zonular support of the lens is often fragile, and vitreous loss is therefore more common in such complicated eyes. As with all surgery, the risks, benefits, and alternatives should be discussed with the patient.</p>
			<p class="h3">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataract surgery may be combined with trabeculectomy in the following situations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-11">cataract requiring extraction in a glaucoma patient who has advanced cupping and visual field loss to minimize postoperative pressure spike</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">cataract requiring extraction in a glaucoma patient who requires medications to control IOP but who tolerates medical therapy poorly or has inadequately controlled IOP</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-19">cataract requiring extraction in a glaucoma patient who requires multiple medications to control IOP</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As stated earlier, combined procedures are generally less effective than trabeculectomy alone in controlling IOP. Thus, in uncontrolled glaucoma, combined surgery is usually performed only in specific circumstances, such as primary angle-&#173;closure glaucoma uncontrolled with medications or after laser iridotomy when cataract surgery alone is <br />unlikely to provide successful IOP control. Many surgeons perform trabeculectomy with cataract surgery when the IOP is stable but the patient is using 2 or 3&#160;IOP-&#173;lowering medications. The goal in these cases is to avoid perioperative problems with elevated IOP and to achieve a long-term reduction in the number of medications required. However, many surgeons would perform cataract surgery alone in a patient who has controlled IOP using 1&#160;medication, with mild to moderate cupping and little visual field loss.</p>
			<p class="h3">Relative contraindications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Combined cataract and filtering surgery should be avoided in the following situations, in which glaucoma surgery alone is preferred:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">glaucoma that requires a very low target IOP</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-12">advanced glaucoma with uncontrolled IOP and immediate need for successful reduction of IOP</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several surgical approaches to coexisting cataract and glaucoma are currently used. Although little evidence exists to compare the long-term outcomes of patients treated with these different approaches, it is reasonable for the surgeon to use the cataract procedure that he or she performs best, because the primary indication for surgery is the presence of cataract.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Trabeculectomy may be combined with phacoemulsification, which is performed through the superior trabeculectomy incision or through a temporal clear corneal incision. Also, cataract extraction may be combined with implantation of a tube shunt. In addition, there are several procedures that combine cataract surgery with surgery on the Schlemm canal, such as canaloplasty (see the section Nonpenetrating Glaucoma Surgery), implantation of a trabecular microbypass stent (eg, iStent, Glaukos Corp, Laguna Hills, CA), and ab interno trabeculotomy with an electroablation device (eg, Trabectome, NeoMedix Inc, Tustin, CA). Electroablation of the trabecular meshwork is performed through a temporal corneal incision, a technique similar to that used in goniotomy, to lower IOP in open-&#173;angle glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For the patient whose IOP is controlled medically, clear corneal cataract surgery alone may be the appropriate choice. As no violation of conjunctiva or sclera occurs with this procedure, standard trabeculectomy can be performed later when dictated by independent indications.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Cataract Extraction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataract extraction has been shown, on average, to lower IOP in eyes with ocular hypertension and various types of glaucoma. This ocular hypotensive effect does decrease over time. In eyes with open angles, IOP reduction resulting from cataract extraction can be equivalent to the pressure-&#173;lowering effect achieved with one hypotensive eyedrop, and the greatest reductions are seen in eyes with higher pressures. When pupillary block is associated with a visually significant cataract, lens extraction might be considered as a primary procedure to relieve pupillary block. However, laser iridotomy can be considered as a first step to stop acute pupillary block, so that cataract surgery may be performed more safely at a later time. Cataract extraction combined with goniosynechialysis may be effective in patients with chronic angle-&#173;closure following acute PAC and in patients with PAC unresponsive to laser iridotomy.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Tube Shunt Implantation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">There are many different types of devices that aid angle filtration by shunting aqueous to a site away from the limbus, such as the equatorial subconjunctival space. Tube shunt implantation generally involves placing a tube in the anterior chamber, in the ciliary sulcus, or through the pars plana into the vitreous cavity. The tube is connected to an extraocular plate, which is attached to the sclera in the equatorial region of the globe, between the extraocular muscles, and in some cases tucked under the muscles; some devices employ 2&#160;plates. Aqueous flows out through the tube and into the subconjunctival space in the region of the extraocular plate.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tube shunts can be broadly categorized as <span class="italic">nonvalved devices,</span> which have no flow restrictor, or <span class="italic">valved devices,</span> which have a flow restrictor (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;8-2</span>). The most frequently used nonvalved devices are the Molteno (Molteno Ophthalmic Ltd, Dunedin, New Zealand) and Baerveldt (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA) designs. The most widely used valved device is the Ahmed design (New World Medical, Inc, Rancho Cucamonga, CA). Two multicenter randomized controlled trials comparing the Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) and the Baerveldt glaucoma implant (BGI) found that the average IOP after 3–5&#160;years was slightly higher in patients who received the AGV; however, there were fewer vision-&#173;threatening complications associated with use of the AGV than with the BGI. The surface area of the plate of each tube shunt varies and can influence IOP control and complications postoperatively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In eyes with an existing encircling band placed for retinal detachment, a Schocket procedure can be performed. In this procedure, a silicone tube is passed from the anterior chamber and threaded into the capsule surrounding a previously placed scleral buckle (Video&#160;8-3).</p>

			<p class="h3">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The devices mentioned and similar types of implants have generally been reserved for difficult glaucoma cases in which trabeculectomy has failed or is likely to fail. However, tube shunt implantation can be used as a primary procedure. The 5-year follow-&#173;up results of the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy study showed that tube shunt surgery with a Baerveldt implant had a higher success rate compared with trabeculectomy with MMC in eyes with prior intraocular surgery. Both procedures were associated with a similar reduction in IOP and use of supplemental medications, but tube shunts required fewer additional surgical procedures. A tube shunt should be considered in the following clinical settings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Failed trabeculectomy with antifibrotics:</span> It may be appropriate to perform a second trabeculectomy in some clinical situations. However, when the factors that precipitated the initial failure cannot be modified, or when it is not technically possible to repeat the trabeculectomy, implantation of a tube shunt may be the procedure of choice.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Active uveitis:</span> Although few randomized, prospective studies have been performed comparing trabeculectomy with antifibrotics to tube shunts in active uveitis, the success rate of trabeculectomy is disappointingly low in most cases of active inflammation. In certain types of uveitis (eg, young patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis), the success rate of trabeculectomy is low and tube shunt implantation is often the primary surgical treatment.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Neovascular glaucoma:</span> Eyes with neovascular glaucoma are at high risk of trabeculectomy failure. In one prospective study, the 5-year success rate of trabeculectomy with 5-FU in neovascular glaucoma was 28%. When possible, panretinal photocoagulation and anti-&#173;VEGF therapy should be administered prior to glaucoma surgery in cases of neovascular glaucoma. When the IOP level is such that urgent surgery is required, or when the neovascular glaucoma does not respond to panretinal photocoagulation, a tube shunt is indicated. These medications may decrease the risk of perioperative intraocular bleeding.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Inadequate conjunctiva:</span> In patients who have undergone severe trauma or previous surgery involving conjunctiva (eg, retinal detachment surgery), the likelihood of trabeculectomy success may be reduced because these patients may have excessive conjunctival scarring. A tube shunt can be implanted, even in the presence of a scleral buckle. When a complete vitrectomy has been performed, the tube can be placed through the pars plana.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Aphakia:</span> The success rate of conventional filtering surgery in aphakic eyes is low, even when MMC is used. Many surgeons use tube shunts as a primary procedure in uncontrolled aphakic glaucoma. Special attention should be paid to any vitreous in an aphakic eye, as vitreous may occlude the tube.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-12"><span class="italic">Contact lens use:</span> The need for contact lens use for vision rehabilitation is an important consideration. The use of a soft contact lens over a trabeculectomy bleb is a risk factor for bleb trauma and subsequent infection. The use of a soft contact lens following tube shunt implantation is not without risk, however, as the conjunctiva overlying the tube is more prone to erosion with contact lens use.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Contraindications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tube shunts may have a complicated postoperative course. Borderline corneal endothelial function is a relative contraindication for anterior chamber placement of a tube.</p>
			<p class="h3">Preoperative considerations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The preoperative evaluation for tube shunt implantation is similar to that for trabeculectomy. During the ophthalmic examination, the clinician should note the findings of the motility examination, the status of the conjunctiva, the health of the sclera at the anticipated sites for the tube and external plate, the location of PAS near possible tube insertion sites, and the location of vitreous in the eye. The clinician should also note a previously placed scleral buckle.</p>
			<p class="h3">Techniques</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although tube shunts differ in design, the basic techniques for implantation are similar. The superotemporal quadrant is the preferred first quadrant for all models. Subsequent tube shunts can be placed in any quadrant, but the inferonasal quadrant tends to be used next for larger plate models, while the superonasal quadrant is used for smaller plate models. Implantation in the superonasal quadrant may be associated with restricted eye movement due to impaired movement of the superior oblique tendon. If there is silicone oil in the eye, or if it is anticipated, an inferior quadrant is preferred. Valved devices must be primed before implantation (Video&#160;8-4). The extraocular plate is sutured between the vertical and horizontal rectus muscles, posterior to the muscle insertions. The tube portion of the device is then routed in 1 of 3&#160;ways: anteriorly to enter the anterior chamber angle parallel to the iris; into the ciliary sulcus in a pseudophakic eye with a posterior facing bevel entering 2.5&#160;mm from the limbus; or through the pars plana, 4&#160;mm to the limbus, for posterior implantation in eyes that have had a complete vitrectomy. Typically, the tube is covered with tissue such as sclera, pericardium, or cornea to help prevent erosion through the conjunctiva. Corneal patch grafts are particularly useful with inferiorly placed tubes because of a better cosmetic result. Dura should be avoided because of the potential risk of prion transmission.</p>

			<p class="body-text">For the nonvalved devices, there are a number of techniques to restrict flow in the early postoperative period, such as stenting the tube lumen or ligating the tube with a suture (Video&#160;8-5). Manually restricting flow is not necessary with devices that contain a built-in flow restrictor, although hypotony and a flat chamber can still sometimes occur with them. Administering antifibrotic agents in doses similar to those used in trabeculectomy does not appear to improve the success of tube shunt surgery. For devices with 2&#160;plates, the second plate and its interconnecting tube may be placed either over or under the superior rectus muscle; the distal plate is attached to the sclera in a manner similar to that in which the proximal plate is attached.</p>

			<p class="body-text">A confounding cause of hypotony can be leakage of aqueous around the tube at its entry site. In general, tubes should be introduced into the anterior chamber via a needle incision that is no larger than the diameter of the tube (23&#160;gauge for most tubes). When the patient’s eye has thin sclera or when the tube is introduced under a partial-&#173;thickness scleral flap, a tighter entry site (eg, 25&#160;gauge) may be required.</p>
			<p class="h3">Postoperative management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The IOP in the early postoperative period can be variable. With nonvalved devices in which the tube has been occluded, early IOP spikes are best managed medically. After sufficient time has passed for a capsule to form around the extraocular plate, the occluding suture is released or dissolves spontaneously for the nonvalved devices. As with tra&#173;beculectomy, topical corticosteroids, topical antibiotics, and cycloplegic agents are used. In valved devices, IOP elevation occurs around 2–8&#160;weeks postoperatively, which probably represents encapsulation of the extraocular reservoir. Aqueous suppression can control the IOP, and this elevation usually improves within 1–6&#160;months.</p>
			<p class="h3">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Success rates have been encouraging, but the implant procedures share many of the complications associated with conventional filtering surgery. In addition, unique problems related to the tubes and plates arise. Early overfiltration in an eye with tube placement in the anterior chamber results in a flat chamber and tube–cornea touch. Tube–cornea touch can compromise the cornea; and even when no touch occurs, an area of corneal decompensation can appear near the tube. Eyes must be monitored for late complications such as tube erosion or plate migration. Ocular motility disturbances may also occur. Tube obstruction, plate migration, or tube erosion may require surgical revision. <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;8-3</span> lists several common complications of tube shunts, along with methods for avoiding their development or managing them.</p>

The goal was to achieve IOP lowering while avoiding some of the complications of standard trabeculectomy. Recently, interest in nonpenetrating surgery has revived. These newer nonpenetrating procedures include deep sclerectomy with or without a collagen implant, viscocanalostomy, and canaloplasty. In both viscocanalostomy and canaloplasty, a deep sclerectomy is augmented with injection of viscoelastic into the Schlemm canal. In viscocanalostomy, a cannula is used to inject viscoelastic into a limited section of the Schlemm canal. In canaloplasty, a flexible illuminated catheter is utilized to inject viscoelastic into the full 360° of the canal and to pass a suture through it; the suture is then tied, leaving the canal stretched. In deep sclerectomy, canaloplasty (Video&#160;8-6), and viscocanalostomy, the surgeon creates a fornix-&#173;based conjunctival incision, then creates a superficial scleral flap and next removes deeper sclera and peripheral cornea underneath, leaving only a thin layer of sclera and Descemet membrane. This allows aqueous to percolate through the Descemet membrane into a scleral lake formed by the removal of the deep scleral flap.</p>

			<p class="body-text">These surgeries are indicated in open-&#173;angle glaucoma. Currently, there are limited long-term data from prospective, randomized trials comparing these new procedures with trabeculectomy. In theory, nonpenetrating surgery should avoid some of the complications associated with trabeculectomy. However, the procedures are technically challenging, and most results suggest that the IOP reduction achieved with nonpenetrating procedures is less than that achieved with trabeculectomy. These procedures also cause conjunctival scarring, which may limit future surgical options. Proponents of nonpenetrating procedures argue that with fewer potential complications, surgery may be considered earlier in the disease process, and that the target IOP may therefore not need to be as low.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The last decade saw the development of a number of devices that are used in surgical procedures to shunt aqueous from the anterior chamber directly into the Schlemm canal or the suprachoroidal space. These procedures, many of which require a gonioscopic view to perform, are considered minimally invasive and enhance the eye’s natural aqueous outflow pathways. They are indicated in early to moderate open-&#173;angle glaucoma for patients who cannot tolerate or adhere to prescribed medication(s) and for patients for whom the risks of traditional surgeries may not be warranted. The procedures are frequently performed at the same time as cataract surgery but can be performed as standalone procedures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ab interno trabeculectomy is similar to goniotomy or ab externo trabeculotomy for pediatric eyes. Used in adult eyes, the procedure is performed with a disposable handpiece (Trabectome, NeoMedix) that fits through a clear corneal incision and delivers an electrosurgical pulse to remove trabecular meshwork, the anatomical site of greatest resistance to aqueous outflow. Electroablation of 180° of the trabecular meshwork (Video&#160;8-7) allows aqueous to flow directly to the Schlemm canal and collector channels. Trabecular meshwork resistance also can be bypassed with a microshunt (iStent, Glaukos Corp). This device is a self-&#173;retaining titanium angled tube, which is placed into the Schlemm canal using a preloaded inserter (Video&#160;8-8). Other microshunts and devices to remove trabecular meshwork are currently under development. These surgeries are indicated in open-&#173;angle glaucoma where trabecular meshwork is readily visible. Reflux bleeding and hyphemas are common postoperatively. There are no long-term prospective data on these procedures. Two-year data comparing a microshunt in combination with cataract surgery to cataract surgery alone showed a slightly higher rate of IOP maintenance below 21&#160;mm&#160;Hg without medication in the combined surgery group.</p>

			<p class="body-text">Clinical trials evaluating aqueous shunting to the suprachoroidal space from an internal approach with various devices are currently under way. Suprachoroidal shunts used with an external approach and made of various materials were tried in the past but were unsuccessful because of problems with hypotony from cyclodialysis cleft formation or ocular hypertension, which developed as a result of scar formation at the posterior end of the seton.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When PAS develop in cases of acute angle closure, iridotomy alone may not lower the IOP adequately. Deepening the anterior chamber through a paracentesis may break PAS that are of relatively recent onset. <span class="italic">Goniosynechialysis,</span> a surgical procedure to break synechiae, is performed in the operating room alone or in combination with cataract surgery. Forceps, a blunt spatula, and/or a viscoelastic agent can be used for goniosynechialysis of PAS that are of less than 6–12&#160;months’ duration.</p>

			<p class="h1">Special Considerations in the Surgical Management of Elderly</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When deciding whether to proceed with surgery in an elderly patient, the surgeon must take into account several issues specific to this population. The first issue is determining the appropriateness of surgery. The surgeon must consider the severity of the disease and the risk of functional vision loss in relation to the patient’s life expectancy. Also, the surgeon must assess the patient’s ability to adhere to medical therapy. A patient who is poorly adherent preoperatively (because of memory loss, poor vision, tremor, or arthritis) stands a high risk of being nonadherent in the postoperative phase and may well jeopardize the outcome as a result. In addition, the surgeon must consider whether the presence of a major systemic disease would affect the patient’s ability to physically withstand the stress of surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once the decision has been made to proceed with surgery, the surgeon should determine which procedure is most likely to be successful and result in the fewest complications. The surgeon should consider the patient’s ability to return to the clinic or office for multiple follow-&#173;up visits. If a patient is not mobile or has no easy transportation options, a nonpenetrating surgery or cyclodestructive procedure may be preferred, as these procedures require fewer postoperative visits than a trabeculectomy requires. If a tra&#173;beculectomy is decided upon, a limbus-&#173;based conjunctival flap is less likely to leak than a fornix-&#173;based flap and might be considered. The patient’s use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications should also be evaluated, as the risk of serious complications from intraocular hemorrhage is increased with their use, and stopping these medications is associated with a risk of cerebrovascular events. Finally, the surgeon must factor in compromised healing in elderly persons and be circumspect about the use of antifibrotics in this group, whose tissues tend to be thinner and more fragile compared with younger patients.</p>
