			<p class="chapter-title">Clinical Evaluation</p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">History and General Examination</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Appropriate management of glaucoma depends on the clinician’s ability to diagnose the specific form of glaucoma in a given patient, to determine the severity of the condition, to predict the likelihood of progression, and to detect progression when it occurs. Clinical evaluation of the glaucoma patient should include a history of the current complaint, including symptoms, onset, duration, and severity. Past ocular history (medical and surgical) and a general medical history, including the patient’s current medications and allergies, should be obtained. On physical examination, prior to biomicroscopy, it is helpful to record the patient’s pulse and blood pressure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinician should inquire about symptoms often associated with glaucoma, such as pain, redness, colored halos around lights, alteration of vision, and loss of vision. Similarly, the general medical history should include specific inquiry about diseases or conditions that may have ocular manifestations or that may affect the patient’s ability to tolerate medications. Such conditions include diabetes mellitus, cardiac and pulmonary disease, hypertension, hemodynamic shock, systemic hypotension, sleep apnea, Raynaud phenomenon, migraine and other neurologic diseases, renal stones, and pregnancy. The clinician should take note of a history of corticosteroid use, either topical or systemic. See also BCSC Section&#160;1, <span class="italic">Update on General Medicine.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Refraction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neutralizing any refractive error is crucial for accurate perimetry with most perimeters, and the clinician should understand how the patient’s refractive state could affect the diagnosis. The hyperopic eye is at increased risk of angle-&#173;closure and generally has a smaller optic nerve head (also called optic disc). Myopia is associated with optic nerve head morphologies that can be clinically confused with glaucoma, and myopic eyes are at increased risk of pigment dispersion.</p>
			<p class="h2">External Adnexae</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Examination and assessment of the external ocular adnexae is useful for determining the presence of a variety of conditions associated with secondary glaucomas as well as external ocular manifestations of glaucoma therapy. The entities described in this section are discussed in greater depth and illustrated in other volumes of the BCSC series; consult the <span class="italic">Master Index.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">An example of an association between adnexal changes and systemic disease is <span class="italic">tuberous sclerosis (Bourneville syndrome),</span> in which glaucoma may occur secondary to vitreous hemorrhage, anterior segment neovascularization, or retinal detachment. Typical external and cutaneous signs of tuberous sclerosis include a hypopigmented lesion termed the “ash-leaf sign” and a red-brown papular rash (adenoma sebaceum) that is often found on the face and chin.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other changes in the ocular adnexa associated with secondary glaucoma include the subcutaneous plexiform neuromas that are a hallmark of the type&#160;1 variant of neurofibromatosis, the yellow and/or orange papules in <span class="italic">juvenile xanthogranuloma,</span> and the skin pigmentation seen in <span class="italic">oculodermal melanocytosis (nevus of Ota).</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Several entities are associated with signs of elevated episcleral venous pressure (see the section Elevated Episcleral Venous Pressure in Chapter&#160;4). The presence of a facial cutaneous angioma (nevus flammeus, or port-wine stain) can indicate <span class="italic">encephalofacial angiomatosis (Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome).</span> Hemifacial hypertrophy may also be observed. The cutaneous hemangiomas of the <span class="italic">Klippel-&#173;Trénaunay-Weber syndrome</span> extend over an affected, secondarily hypertrophied limb and may also involve the face. Orbital varices, arteriovenous fistulas, and superior vena cava syndrome may also be associated with elevated episcleral venous pressure and secondary glaucoma. Intermittent unilateral prop&#173;tosis and dilated eyelid veins are key external signs of <span class="italic">orbital varices.</span> <span class="italic">Carotid-&#173;cavernous, dural-&#173;cavernous,</span> and other <span class="italic">arteriovenous fistulas</span> can produce orbital bruits, restricted ocular motility, proptosis, and pulsating exophthalmos. <span class="italic">Superior vena cava syndrome</span> can cause proptosis and facial and eyelid edema, as well as conjunctival chemosis. <span class="italic">Thyroid eye disease</span> may also be associated with glaucoma; ophthalmic features of this disease include exophthalmos, eyelid retraction, and motility disorders.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Use of prostaglandin analogues may result in cosmetic changes to the ocular adnexa; these are described in Chapter&#160;7.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Pupils</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pupil size may be affected by glaucoma therapy, and pupillary responses are one measure of adherence in patients who are on miotic therapy. Testing for a relative afferent pupillary defect may detect asymmetric optic nerve damage. Corectopia, ectropion uveae, and pupillary abnormalities may also be observed in some forms of secondary open-&#173;angle glaucoma and angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. In some clinical situations, it is not possible to assess the pupils objectively for the presence of a relative afferent defect, and a subjective comparison between the eyes of the perceived brightness of a test light may be helpful. Testing for color vision, extraocular motility, and cranial nerve abnormality can also be helpful in the differential diagnosis of nonglaucomatous versus glaucomatous optic neuropathy.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Biomicroscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Biomicroscopy of the anterior segment is performed for signs of underlying ocular conditions that may be associated with glaucoma. BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> discusses slit-lamp technique and the examination of the external eye in greater depth.</p>
			<p class="h3">Conjunctiva</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyes with acutely elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) may show conjunctival hyperemia. Long-term use of sympathomimetics and prostaglandin analogues may also cause conjunctival hyperemia, and long-term use of epinephrine derivatives may result in black adrenochrome deposits in the conjunctiva. Allergic reaction to ocular hypotensive medications (especially <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonists) may be accompanied by a follicular reaction. The use of topical ocular hypotensive medication can also cause decreased tear production, allergic and hypersensitivity reactions (papillary and follicular conjunctivitis), foreshortening of the conjunctival fornices, and scarring. Prior to filtering surgery, the presence or absence of subconjunctival scarring or other conjunctival abnormalities should be assessed. The presence or absence of any filtering bleb should be noted. If a bleb is present, its size, height, degree of vascularization, and integrity should be noted, and in the situation of postoperative hypotony, a Seidel test performed.</p>
			<p class="h3">Episclera and sclera</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dilation of the episcleral vessels may indicate elevated episcleral venous pressure, as seen in the secondary glaucomas associated with Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome, arteriovenous fistulae, or thyroid eye disease. Sentinel vessels may be seen in eyes harboring an intraocular tumor. The clinician should note any thinning or staphylomatous areas. Oculodermal melanocytosis may affect the sclera, and affected patients are at increased risk for glaucoma and ocular melanoma. The presence of scleritis may also be associated with high IOP.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Cornea</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Enlargement of the cornea associated with breaks in the Descemet membrane (Haab striae) is commonly found in developmental glaucoma patients. Glaucomas associated with other anterior segment anomalies are described in the following discussions. Punctate epithelial defects, especially in the inferonasal interpalpebral region, are often indicative of medication toxicity. Microcystic epithelial edema is commonly associated with elevated IOP, particularly when the IOP rise is acute. The following corneal endothelial abnormalities can be important clues to underlying associated secondary glaucoma:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Krukenberg spindle in pigmentary glaucoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">deposition of exfoliative material in pseudoexfoliation syndrome</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">keratic precipitates in uveitic glaucoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">irregular and vesicular lesions in posterior polymorphous dystrophy</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">a “beaten bronze” appearance in the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">large posterior embryotoxon in Axenfeld-&#173;Rieger syndrome</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician should note the presence of traumatic or surgical corneal scars. The central corneal thickness (CCT) of all patients suspected of having glaucoma should be assessed by corneal pachymetry, as a thin central cornea is a risk factor for glaucoma. (See Chapters&#160;2 and&#160;4.)</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Anterior chamber</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When evaluating the anterior chamber, the examiner should note the uniformity of depth of the chamber and estimate the width of the angle. In the Van Herick method of estimating angle width, the examiner projects a narrow slit beam onto the cornea, just anterior to the limbus. This method may miss narrow angles or angle closure and is not a substitute for gonioscopy, which is discussed in detail later in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Iris bombé and plateau iris syndrome can both result in an anterior chamber that is deep centrally and shallow or flat peripherally. In contrast, in malignant (aqueous misdirection) glaucoma and other posterior “pushing” glaucoma mechanisms (see Chapter&#160;1, Fig&#160;1-1), both peripheral and central chambers are shallow. Iris masses, choroidal effusions, or trauma can produce an irregular iris surface contour and nonuniformity or asymmetry in anterior chamber depth. In many circumstances, especially in the assessment of narrow-&#173;angle glaucoma, comparing the chamber depth of the 2&#160;eyes is of substantial value. The presence of inflammatory cells, red blood cells, floating pigment, or inflammatory debris (such as fibrin) should be noted. The degree of inflammation (flare and cell) and presence of pigment should be determined before instillation of eyedrops.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Iris</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Examination of the iris should be performed before pupillary dilation. The clinician should note heterochromia, iris atrophy, transillumination defects, ectropion uveae, corectopia, nevi, nodules, and exfoliative material. Early stages of neovascularization of the anterior segment may appear as either fine tufts around the pupillary margin or a fine network of vessels on the surface of the iris adjacent to the iris root. The clinician should also examine the iris for evidence of trauma, such as sphincter tears or iridodonesis. Iris color should be noted, especially in patients being considered for treatment with a prostaglandin analogue.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Lens</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician should examine the lens both before and after pupillary dilation, evaluating the size, shape, clarity, and stability of the lens. Findings from this examination may help diagnose lens-&#173;related glaucomas and guide management. Before the pupil is dilated, phacodonesis, pseudoexfoliation, subluxation, and dislocation should be noted. A posterior subcapsular cataract may be indicative of long-term corticosteroid use. An intraocular foreign body with siderosis and glaucoma may also result in characteristic lens changes. If an intraocular lens is present, the clinician should record its type and position, along with the status of the posterior capsule.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Fundus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A dilated examination allows the clinician to evaluate the vitreous for signs of inflammation, hemorrhage, or ghost cells. Careful stereoscopic evaluation of the optic nerve head should be performed, followed by examination of the fundus to detect posterior segment pathology such as hemorrhages, effusions, masses, inflammatory lesions, retinovascular occlusions, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachments that can be associated with the glaucomas.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Gonioscopy</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Gonioscopy is an essential diagnostic tool and examination technique used to visualize the structures of the anterior chamber angle (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;3-1</span>). Unfortunately, this procedure is often underutilized in clinical practice, potentially leading to incorrect diagnosis and management. <span class="xref-figure">Figures&#160;3-1 and 3-2</span> give schematic and clinical views of the angle as seen with gonioscopy. Gonioscopy is required in order to visualize the angle because, under normal conditions, light reflected from the angle structures undergoes total internal reflection at the tear–air interface. At the tear–air interface, the critical angle (approximately 46°) is reached, and light is totally reflected back into the corneal stroma. This prevents direct visualization of the angle structures. Gonioscopy lenses eliminate the tear–air interface by placing a plastic or glass surface adjacent to the front surface of the eye. The small space between the lens and cornea is filled by the patient’s tears, saline solution, or a clear viscous substance. Depending on the type of lens employed, the angle can be examined with a direct (eg, Koeppe) system or a mirrored indirect (eg, Goldmann or Zeiss) system (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Direct and Indirect Gonioscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Gonioscopy techniques fall into 1 of 2&#160;broad categories: direct and indirect (see Fig&#160;3-3). <span class="italic">Direct gonioscopy</span> is performed with a binocular microscope, a fiber-&#173;optic illuminator or slit-pen light, and a direct goniolens, such as the Koeppe, Barkan, Wurst, Swan-Jacob, or Richardson lens. The lens is placed on the eye, and saline solution is used to fill the space between the cornea and the lens. The saline acts as an optical coupler between the 2&#160;surfaces. The lens provides direct visualization of the anterior chamber angle (ie, light reflected directly from the angle is visualized). With direct gonioscopy lenses, the clinician has an erect view of the angle structures, which is essential when goniotomies are performed. Direct gonioscopy is most easily performed with the patient in a supine position, and it is commonly used in the operating room for examining the eyes of infants under anesthesia.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Indirect gonioscopy</span> is more frequently used in the clinician’s office. Indirect gonioscopy also eliminates the total internal reflection at the surface of the cornea. Light reflected from the angle passes into the indirect gonioscopy lens and is reflected by a mirror within the lens. Indirect gonioscopy may be used with the patient in an upright position, with illumination and magnification provided by a slit lamp. A <span class="italic">goniolens,</span> which contains 1 or more mirrors, yields an inverted and slightly foreshortened image of the opposite angle. Although the image is inverted with an indirect goniolens, the right–left orientation of a horizontal mirror and the up–down orientation of a vertical mirror remain unchanged. The foreshortening, combined with the upright position of the patient, makes the angle appear a little shallower than it does with direct gonioscopy systems. The Goldmann-&#173;type goniolens requires a viscous fluid such as methylcellulose for optical coupling with the cornea. When the goniolens has only 1&#160;mirror, the lens must be rotated to view the entire angle. Posterior pressure on the lens, especially if it is tilted, indents the sclera and may falsely narrow the angle. These lenses provide the clearest visualization of the anterior chamber angle structures, and they may be modified with antireflective coatings for use during laser procedures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Posner, Sussman, and Zeiss 4-mirror goniolenses allow all 4&#160;quadrants of the anterior chamber angle to be visualized without rotation of the lens during examination. Since the Goldmann-&#173;type lens has approximately the same radius of curvature as the cornea, they are optically coupled by the patient’s tears. However, pressure on the cornea may distort the angle. The examiner can detect this pressure by noting the induced Descemet membrane folds. Although pressure may falsely open the angle, the technique of dynamic gonioscopy is sometimes essential for distinguishing iridocorneal apposition from synechial closure. Many clinicians prefer these lenses because of their ease of use and employment in performing dynamic gonioscopy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because the posterior diameter of these goniolenses is smaller than the corneal diameter, posterior pressure can be used to force open a narrowed angle. With dynamic gonioscopy (compression or indentation gonioscopy), gentle pressure is placed on the cornea, and aqueous humor is forced into the angle (see Fig&#160;3-3). In inexperienced hands, dynamic gonioscopy may be misleading, as undue pressure on the anterior surface of the cornea may distort the angle or may give the observer the false impression of an open angle. With all indirect gonioscopy techniques, the observer may manipulate the anterior chamber angle by repositioning the patient’s eye (having the patient look toward the mirror) or by applying pressure with the posterior surface of the lens to provide more complete evaluation of the angle. However, caution must be used to avoid inducing artificial opening or closing of the angle with these techniques.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Gonioscopic Assessment and Documentation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In performing both direct and indirect gonioscopy, the clinician must recognize the landmarks of the anterior chamber angle. It is important to perform gonioscopy with dim room light and a thin, short light beam in order to minimize the amount of light entering the pupil. An excessive amount of light could result in increased pupillary constriction and a change in the peripheral angle appearance that could falsely open the angle, thereby preventing the correct identification of a narrow or occluded angle. The scleral spur and the Schwalbe line, 2&#160;important angle landmarks, are most consistently identified. A convenient gonioscopic technique to determine the exact position of the Schwalbe line is the <span class="italic">parallelepiped technique.</span> The parallelepiped, or corneal light wedge, technique allows the observer to determine the exact junction of the cornea and the trabecular meshwork. Using a narrow slit beam and sharp focus, the examiner sees 2&#160;linear reflections, one from the external surface of the cornea and its junction with the sclera and the other from the internal surface of the cornea. The 2&#160;reflections meet at the Schwalbe line (see Fig&#160;3-1). The scleral spur is a thin, pale stripe between the ciliary face and the pigmented zone of the trabecular meshwork. The inferior portion of the angle is generally wider and is the easiest place in which to locate the landmarks. After verifying the landmarks, the clinician should examine the entire angle in an orderly manner (see Table&#160;3-1).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Proper management of glaucoma requires that the clinician determine not only whether the angle is open or closed, but also whether other pathologic findings, such as angle recession or peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), are present. In angle closure, the peripheral iris obstructs the trabecular meshwork—that is, the meshwork is not visible on gonioscopy. The width of the angle is determined by the site of insertion of the iris on the ciliary face, the convexity of the iris, and the prominence of the peripheral iris roll. In many cases, the angle appears to be open but very narrow. It is often difficult to distinguish a narrow but open angle from an angle with partial closure; dynamic gonioscopy is useful in this situation (see Figs&#160;3-2 and 3-3).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The best method for describing the angle is to use a standardized grading system or draw the iris contour, the location of the iris insertion, and the angle between the iris and the trabecular meshwork. A variety of gonioscopic grading systems have been developed, all of which facilitate standardized description of angle structures and abbreviate that description. Keep in mind that, with abbreviated descriptions, some details of the angle structure will be eliminated. The most commonly used gonioscopic grading systems are the Shaffer and Spaeth systems. A quadrant-by-&#173;quadrant narrative description of the chamber angle noting localized findings such as neovascular tufts, angle recession, or PAS may also be used to document serial gonioscopic findings. If a grading system is used, the clinician should specify which system is being used.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">Shaffer system</span> describes the angle between the trabecular meshwork and the iris as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-7"><span class="italic">G</span><span class="italic">rade 4:</span> The angle between the iris and the surface of the trabecular meshwork is&#160;45°.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Grade 3:</span> The angle between the iris and the surface of the trabecular meshwork is greater than 20° but less than 45°.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Grade 2:</span> The angle between the iris and the surface of the trabecular meshwork is 20°. Angle closure is possible.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Grade 1:</span> The angle between the iris and the surface of the trabecular meshwork is 10°. Angle closure is probable in time.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Slit:</span> The angle between the iris and the surface of the trabecular meshwork is less than 10°. Angle closure is very likely.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-8"><span class="italic">0:</span> The iris is against the trabecular meshwork. Angle closure is present.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">Spaeth gonioscopic grading system</span> expands this system to include a description of the peripheral iris contour, the insertion of the iris root, and the effects of dynamic gonioscopy on the angle configuration (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ordinarily, the Schlemm canal is invisible by gonioscopy. However, blood enters the Schlemm canal when episcleral venous pressure exceeds IOP, most commonly because of compression of the episcleral veins by the lip of the goniolens (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-5</span>). Pathologic causes include hypotony and elevated episcleral venous pressure, as in carotid-&#173;cavernous fistula or Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Normal blood vessels in the angle include radial iris vessels, portions of the arterial circle of the ciliary body, and vertical branches of the anterior ciliary arteries. Normal vessels are oriented either radially along the iris or circumferentially (in a serpentine manner) in the ciliary body face. Vessels that cross the scleral spur to reach the trabecular meshwork are usually abnormal (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-6</span>). The vessels seen in Fuchs heterochromic uveitis are fine, branching, unsheathed, and meandering. Patients with neovascular glaucoma have trunklike vessels crossing the ciliary body and scleral spur and arborizing over the trabecular meshwork. Contraction of the myofibroblasts accompanying these vessels leads to PAS formation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is important to distinguish PAS from iris processes (the uveal meshwork), which are open and lacy and follow the normal curve of the angle. The angle structures are visible in the open spaces between the processes. Synechiae are more solid or sheetlike (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-7</span>). They are composed of iris stroma and obliterate the angle recess.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Pigmentation</span> of the trabecular meshwork increases with age and tends to be more marked in individuals with darkly pigmented irides. Pigmentation can be segmental and is usually most marked in the inferior angle. The pigmentation pattern of an individual angle is dynamic over time, especially in conditions such as pigment dispersion syndrome. Heavy pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork should suggest pigment dispersion or pseudoexfoliation syndrome. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome may appear clinically similar to pigment dispersion syndrome, with pigment granules on the anterior surface of the iris, increased pigment in the anterior chamber angle, and secondary open-&#173;angle glaucoma. In addition, a line of pigment deposition anterior to the Schwalbe line is often present in <br />pseudoexfoliation syndrome (Sampaolesi line). Other conditions that cause increased anterior chamber angle pigmentation include melanoma, trauma, surgery, inflammation, angle closure, and hyphema.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Posttraumatic angle recession</span> may be associated with monocular open-&#173;angle glaucoma. The gonioscopic criteria for diagnosing angle recession include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-9">an abnormally wide ciliary body band (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-8</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">increased prominence of the scleral spur</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">torn iris processes</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">marked variation of ciliary face width and angle depth in different quadrants of the same eye</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">In evaluating for angle recession, the clinician may find it helpful to compare one part of the angle to other areas in the same eye or to the same area in the fellow eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;3-9</span> illustrates the variety of gonioscopic findings caused by blunt trauma. If the ciliary body separates from the scleral spur (cyclodialysis), it will appear gonioscopically as a deep angle recess with a gap between the scleral spur and the ciliary body. Detection of a very small cleft may require ultrasound biomicroscopy.</p>

			<p class="h1">The Optic Nerve</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The entire visual pathway is described and illustrated in BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span> For further discussion of retinal involvement in the visual process, see Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Anatomy and Pathology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The optic nerve is the neural connection between the neurosensory retina and the brain, primarily the lateral geniculate body. An understanding of the normal and pathologic appearance of the optic nerve allows the clinician to detect glaucoma, as well as to follow glaucoma cases. The optic nerve is composed of neural tissue, glial tissue, extracellular matrix, and blood vessels. The human optic nerve consists of approximately 1.2–1.5&#160;million axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), although there is significant individual variability. The cell bodies of the RGCs lie in the ganglion cell layer of the retina. The intraorbital optic nerve is divided into 2&#160;components: the anterior optic nerve and the posterior optic nerve. The anterior optic nerve extends from the retinal surface to the retrolaminar region, just where the nerve exits the posterior aspect of the globe. The average diameter of the optic nerve head is approximately 1.5–1.7&#160;mm as measured with planimetry, but it varies widely among individuals and ethnic groups; the optic nerve expands to approximately 3–4&#160;mm immediately upon exiting the globe. The increase in size is accounted for by axonal myelination, glial tissue, and the beginning of the leptomeninges (optic nerve sheath). The axons are separated into fascicles within the optic nerve, with the intervening spaces occupied by astrocytes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In primates, there are 3&#160;major RGC types involved in conscious visual perception: magnocellular neurons (M&#160;cells), parvocellular neurons (P&#160;cells), and koniocellular neurons (bistratified cells). M&#160;cells have large-&#173;diameter axons, synapse in the magnocellular layer of the lateral geniculate body, are sensitive to luminance changes in dim illumination (scotopic conditions), have the largest dendritic field, primarily process information related to motion perception, and are not responsive to color. In comparison to the M&#160;cells, the P&#160;cells account for approximately 80% of all ganglion cells; they are concentrated in the central retina; and they have smaller-&#173;diameter axons, smaller receptive fields, and slower conduction velocity. They synapse in the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate body. P&#160;cells subserve color vision, are most active under higher luminance conditions, and discriminate fine detail. The cells are motion-&#173;insensitive and process information of high spatial frequency (high resolution). The bistratified cells (koniocellular neurons) process information concerned with blue-&#173;yellow color opponency. This system, which is likely preferentially activated by short-wavelength perimetry, is inhibited when red and green cones (yellow) are activated and stimulated when blue cones are activated. Bistratified and large M&#160;cells each account for approximately 10% of RGCs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The distribution of nerve fibers as they enter the optic nerve head is shown in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;3-10</span>. The arcuate nerve fibers entering the superior and inferior poles of the disc seem to be more susceptible to glaucomatous damage. This susceptibility explains the frequent occurrence of arcuate nerve fiber bundle visual field defects in glaucoma. The arrangement of the axons in the optic nerve head and their differential susceptibility to damage determine the patterns of visual field loss seen in glaucoma, which are described and illustrated later in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The anterior optic nerve can be divided into 4&#160;layers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-14">nerve fiber</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">prelaminar</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most anterior zone is the superficial nerve fiber layer region, which is continuous with the <span class="italic">nerve fiber layer</span> of the retina. This region is primarily composed of the axons of the RGCs in transition from the superficial retina to the neuronal component of the optic nerve. The nerve fiber layer can be viewed with the ophthalmoscope when the red-free (green) filter is used. Immediately posterior to the nerve fiber layer is the <span class="italic">prelaminar region,</span> which lies adjacent to the peripapillary choroid. More posteriorly, the <span class="italic">laminar region</span> is continuous with the sclera and is composed of the lamina cribrosa, a structure consisting of fenestrated connective tissue lamellae that allow the transit of neural fibers through the scleral coat. Finally, the <span class="italic">retrolaminar region</span> lies posterior to the lamina cribrosa, is marked by the beginning of axonal myelination, and is surrounded by the leptomeninges of the central nervous system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The lamina cribrosa provides the main structural support for the optic nerve as it exits the eye and is composed of a reticulated network of connective tissue beams that are composed primarily of collagen (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-11</span>). Other extracellular matrix components include elastin, laminin, and fibronectin. Beams also contain the capillaries that nourish this critical region. Neural components of the optic nerve pass through these connective tissue beams. In addition, relatively large, central fenestrations allow transit of the central retinal artery and central retinal vein. The connective tissue density within the lamina has been described histologically as lesser superiorly and inferiorly as compared with the temporal and nasal aspects of the optic nerve. It has been suggested that these differences play a role in the development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The pores of the lamina cribrosa may often be seen by ophthalmoscopy at the base of the optic nerve head cup. Between the optic nerve and the adjacent choroidal and scleral tissue lies a rim of connective tissue, the ring of Elschnig.</p>

			<p class="h3">Blood supply to the optic nerve</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vascular anatomy of the anterior optic nerve and peripapillary region has been extensively studied (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-12</span>). The arterial supply of the anterior optic nerve is derived entirely from branches of the ophthalmic artery via 1–5&#160;posterior ciliary arteries. Typically, between 2 and 4&#160;posterior ciliary arteries course anteriorly before dividing into approximately 10–20&#160;short posterior ciliary arteries prior to entering the posterior globe. Often, the posterior ciliary arteries separate into a medial and a lateral group before branching into the short posterior ciliary arteries. The short posterior ciliary arteries penetrate the perineural sclera of the posterior globe to supply the peripapillary choroid, as well as most of the anterior optic nerve. Some short posterior ciliary arteries course, without branching, through the sclera directly into the choroid; others divide within the sclera to provide branches to both the choroid and the optic nerve. Often a noncontinuous arterial circle exists within the perineural sclera, the circle of Zinn-&#173;Haller. The central retinal artery, also a posterior orbital branch of the ophthalmic artery, penetrates the optic nerve approximately 10–15&#160;mm behind the globe. The central retinal artery has few, if any, intraneural branches, the exception being an occasional small branch within the retrolaminar region, which may anastomose with the pial system. The central retinal artery courses adjacent to the central retinal vein within the central portion of the optic nerve.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The superficial nerve fiber layer is supplied principally by recurrent retinal arterioles branching from the central retinal artery. These small vessels, originating in the peripapillary nerve fiber layer, run toward the center of the optic nerve head and have been referred to as <span class="italic">epipapillary vessels.</span> The capillary branches from these vessels are continuous with the retinal capillaries at the optic nerve head margin, but they also have posterior anastomoses with the prelaminar capillaries of the optic nerve. The temporal nerve fiber layer may have an arterial contribution from the cilioretinal artery, when it is present.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">prelaminar region</span> is principally supplied by direct branches of the short posterior ciliary arteries and by branches of the circle of Zinn-&#173;Haller, when it is present. In eyes with a well-&#173;developed circle of Zinn-&#173;Haller, arterial branches emerge to supply both the prelaminar and the laminar regions. The lamina cribrosa region also receives its blood supply from branches of the short posterior ciliary arteries or from branches of the circle of Zinn-&#173;Haller; this is similar to the prelaminar region. These precapillary branches perforate the outer aspects of the lamina cribrosa before branching into an intraseptal capillary network. Arterioles also branch from the short posterior ciliary arteries and the circle of Zinn-&#173;Haller and course posteriorly to supply the pial arteries. These pial arteries often contribute to the laminar region. As in the prelaminar region, the larger vessels of the peripapillary choroid may contribute occasional small arterioles to this region, although there is no connection between the peripapillary choriocapillaris and the capillaries of the optic nerve.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">retrolaminar region</span> is also supplied by branches from the short posterior ciliary arteries, as well as by the pial arterial branches coursing adjacent to the retrolaminar optic nerve region. The pial arteries originate from both the central retinal artery, before it pierces the retrobulbar optic nerve, and branches of the short posterior ciliary arteries more anteriorly. The central retinal artery may supply several small intraneural branches in the retrolaminar region.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The rich capillary beds of each of the 4&#160;anatomical regions within the anterior optic nerve are anatomically confluent. The venous drainage of the anterior optic nerve is almost exclusively via a single vein, the central retinal vein. In the nerve fiber layer, blood is drained directly into the retinal veins, which then join to form the central retinal vein. In the prelaminar, laminar, and retrolaminar regions, venous drainage also occurs via the central retinal vein or axial tributaries to the central retinal vein.</p>

			<p class="h1">Glaucomatous Optic Neuropathy</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Glaucomatous optic neuropathy is the sine qua non of all forms of glaucoma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-13</span>). Histologically, early glaucomatous cupping consists of loss of axons, blood vessels, and glial cells. The loss of tissue seems to start at the level of the lamina cribrosa and is associated with remodeling of the load-&#173;bearing connective tissues. It is most pronounced at the superior and inferior poles of the optic nerve head. In many cases, though not always, structural optic nerve changes may precede detectable functional loss.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Glaucomatous cupping in infants and children is accompanied by an expansion of the entire scleral ring, which may explain why cupping seems to occur earlier in children and why reversibility of cupping is more prominent with successful treatment in these cases. Cupping may be reversed in adults as well, but such reversal is less frequent and more subtle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Glaucomatous optic neuropathy is a progressive degeneration of RGCs and their axons, with damage extending from the optic nerve to the major visual centers in the brain, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus. IOP plays a major role in the development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy in most individuals and is considered the most significant risk factor. The role of IOP as a risk factor for development and progression in glaucoma has been well established by several multicenter randomized clinical trials, as well as by experimental investigations. However, up to one-&#173;third of patients in North America have signs of glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve despite IOP levels within statistically normal limits. Therefore, it is likely that factors other than IOP may contribute to a given individual’s susceptibility to glaucomatous damage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Damage from direct compression of axonal fibers, with distortion of the lamina cribrosa beams and interruption of axoplasmic flow, may contribute to RGC death. Decreased optic nerve head perfusion and/or disturbance of vascular autoregulation may also contribute to optic nerve damage in glaucoma, either directly or as a consequence of biomechanical effects. Alternatively, changes in systemic hemodynamics may result in perfusion deficits, even at a normal IOP level. Neural degeneration in glaucoma may have a number of triggers. Glutamate excitotoxicity, autoimmunity, and neurotrophic dep&#173;rivation have all been suggested as causes of secondary injury. Current thinking recognizes that glaucoma is a heterogeneous family of disorders mediated, most likely, by many factors.</p>

			<p class="h2">Examination of the Optic Nerve Head</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinical examination of the optic nerve head is preferably performed with a slit-lamp biomicroscope combined with a high-&#173;magnification posterior pole lens (60.00, 78.00, or 90.00&#160;D lens). The slit beam, rather than diffuse illumination, is useful for determining subtle changes in the contour of the nerve head. This system provides high magnification, excellent illumination, and a stereoscopic view of the optic nerve head. This also allows for quantitative measurement of the diameter of the optic nerve head, by adjusting the height of the slit beam. The disc is viewed through the handheld lens until the height of the slit is the same as the vertical diameter of the disc. The disc diameter can then be calculated by taking into account the lens used. With a 60.00&#160;D lens, the height of the slit equals the disc diameter, in millimeters, read directly from the scale. If a 78.00&#160;D lens is used, the scale reading is multiplied by 1.1, and with a 90.00&#160;D lens multiplication by 1.3&#160;results in the disc diameter in millimeters. The normal-&#173;sized optic nerve head ranges from approximately 1.5 to 2.2&#160;mm in diameter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">direct ophthalmoscope</span> also may be used for clinical examination of the optic nerve head. However, this instrument may not provide sufficient stereoscopic detail to detect subtle changes in optic nerve head topography. The <span class="italic">indirect ophthalmoscope</span> can be used for examination of the optic nerve head in young children and in uncooperative patients. With the indirect ophthalmoscope, cupping of the optic nerve can be detected, but, in general, optic nerve cupping and pallor appear less pronounced than with slit-lamp methods, and the magnification is often inadequate for detecting subtle or localized details important in the evaluation of glaucoma. Thus, the indirect ophthalmoscope is not recommended for routine use in examining the optic nerve head.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The optic nerve head is usually round or slightly oval in shape and contains a central <span class="italic">cup.</span> The tissue between the cup and the disc margin is called the <span class="italic">neural rim</span> or <span class="italic">neuroretinal rim.</span> In individuals without glaucoma, the rim has a relatively uniform width and a color that ranges from orange to pink. The size of the physiologic cup is developmentally determined and is related to the size of the disc. For a given number of nerve fibers, the larger the overall disc area, the larger the cup. Cup–disc ratio alone is not an adequate assessment of the optic nerve head for possible glaucomatous damage. For example, a 0.7&#160;ratio in a large optic nerve head may be normal, whereas a 0.3&#160;ratio in a very small disc could be pathologic. This shows the importance of assessing the disc size. The size of the cup may increase slightly with age. Nonglaucomatous black individuals, on average, have larger disc areas and larger cup–disc ratios than do whites, although a substantial overlap exists.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Differentiating physiologic or normal cupping from acquired <span class="italic">glaucomatous cupping</span> of the optic nerve head can be difficult. The early changes of glaucomatous optic neuropathy are very subtle and include generalized enlargement of the cup, focal rim thinning, superficial disc hemorrhage, nerve fiber layer loss, asymmetry of cupping, and beta (<span class="greek--tx-">b</span>) zone of peripapillary atrophy (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;3-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Diffuse neuroretinal rim thinning associated with generalized enlargement of the cup</span> may be an early sign of glaucomatous damage. However, diffuse loss may be difficult to appreciate unless previous objective documentation of the optic nerve head (eg, photographs) is available. Comparing one eye with the fellow eye may be helpful, because cup asymmetry is unusual in normal eyes in the absence of disc size asymmetry (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-14</span>). The vertical cup–disc ratio is normally between 0.1 and 0.4, although as many as 5% of individuals without glaucoma will have cup–disc ratios larger than 0.6. Asymmetry of the cup–disc ratio of more than 0.2 occurs in less than 1% of individuals without glaucoma. This asymmetry may be related to disc size asymmetry. Increased size of the physiologic cup may be a familial trait, and it is also seen with high myopia. An oblique insertion of the optic nerve into the globe of individuals with high myopia may also cause a tilted appearance to the optic nerve head. Examination of other family members may clarify whether a large cup is inherited or acquired.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Localized loss of the neuroretinal rim</span> most typically occurs at the inferior and superior temporal poles of the optic nerve in early glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The preferential loss of rim tissue in the superior and inferior poles leads to a vertically elongated cup in glaucomatous nerves (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-15</span>). To help identify subtle thinning of the neuroretinal rim, a convention referred to as the <span class="italic">ISNT rule</span> may be useful. In normal eyes, the <span class="italic">I</span>nferior neuroretinal rim is generally the thickest, followed by the <span class="CharOverride-1">S</span>uperior rim, the <span class="italic">N</span>asal rim, and finally the <span class="italic">T</span>emporal rim. Therefore, if the rim widths do not follow this pattern, there should be increased concern for the presence of focal loss of rim tissue. However, violation of the ISNT rule is not highly specific and may be seen in normal eyes as well. Deep localized notching, where the lamina cribrosa is visible at the disc margin, is sometimes termed an <span class="italic">acquired optic disc pit.</span> Patients with acquired pits are at especially high risk for progression. Even in the normal eye, laminar trabeculations or pores may be seen as grayish dots in the base of the physiologic cup. With glaucomatous optic neuropathy, neural atrophy results in more extensive exposure of the underlying lamina cribrosa and may reveal more laminar pores or striations in the optic nerve cup. Nasalization of the central retinal artery and central retinal vein is often seen as the cup enlarges.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although <span class="italic">nerve fiber layer hemorrhages</span> usually appear as a linear red streak on or near the disc surface (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-16</span>), their appearance is highly variable. One-third of glaucoma patients at some time during the course of their disease may develop hemorrhages, which typically clear over several&#160;weeks to months. They are often followed by localized notching of the rim and visual field loss. Some glaucoma patients have repeated episodes of optic disc hemorrhage; others have none. Optic nerve head hemorrhage is an important prognostic sign for the development or progression of visual field loss, and any patient with a disc hemorrhage requires detailed evaluation and follow-&#173;up. Disc hemorrhages may also be caused by posterior vitreous detachments, diabetes mellitus, branch retinal vein occlusions, and anticoagulation therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Axons in the nerve fiber layer of the normal eye may best be visualized with red-free illumination. As the nerve fibers extend from the peripheral retina to converge at the optic nerve head, they appear as fine striations created by the bundles of axons. In the healthy eye, the brightness and striations of the nerve fiber layer are more easily visible superiorly and inferiorly. With progressive glaucomatous optic neuropathy, the nerve fiber layer thins and becomes less visible. The loss may be diffuse (generalized) or localized (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-17</span>). With diffuse loss, there is general reduction of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) brightness, with reduction of the difference normally occurring between the superior and inferior poles, when compared to the temporal and nasal regions. Localized RNFL loss appears as wedge-shaped dark areas emanating from the optic nerve head in an arcuate pattern. Slitlike defects can sometimes also be seen in the nerve fiber layer; however, these are seen in normal RNFL anatomy, though usually not extending to the disc margin. Early wedge-shaped defects are sometimes visible only at a distance from the optic disc margin. <span class="italic">Diffuse nerve fiber loss</span> is more common in glaucoma than is focal loss but also more difficult to observe. The nerve fiber layer can be visualized clearly in high-&#173;contrast black-and-white photographs, and experienced observers can recognize even early disease if good-&#173;quality photographs are available. Slit-lamp techniques and direct ophthalmoscopy can be successfully employed to observe the RNFL. The combination of red-free filter, wide slit beam, and posterior pole lens at the slit lamp affords the best view.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There are 2&#160;types of peripapillary atrophy (PPA): alpha (<span class="greek--tx-">a</span>) zone and beta (<span class="greek--tx-">b</span>) zone. Alpha zone is present in most normal eyes as well as in eyes with glaucoma and is characterized by a region of irregular hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The more important zone with respect to glaucoma is <br /><span class="greek--tx-">b</span> zone, which is due to atrophy of the RPE and choriocapillaris, leading to increased visibility of the large choroidal vessels and sclera. Beta zone is more common and extensive in eyes with glaucoma than in healthy eyes. The area of PPA is spatially correlated with the area of neuroretinal rim loss, with the atrophy being largest in the corresponding area of thinner neuroretinal rim. Therefore, an area of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-zone atrophy should draw the examiner’s attention to the adjacent neuroretinal rim to search for glaucomatous loss.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other, less specific, signs of glaucomatous damage include nasal displacement of the vessels, narrowing of peripapillary retinal vessels, and baring of the circumlinear vessels. With advanced damage, the cup becomes pale and markedly excavated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is important to recognize that glaucomatous optic nerve damage is only one type of pathologic change of the optic nerve; other etiologies of optic nerve changes should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Certain conditions may cause apparent cupping of the optic nerve that can be confounded with glaucoma, such as congenital pits of the optic nerve head, coloboma, morning glory syndrome, arteritic ischemic neuropathy or compressive optic neuropathies. Optic nerve heads in which the remaining neuroretinal rim tissue is pale may need to be evaluated for causes of nonglaucomatous optic atrophy (see BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>). With rare exceptions, glaucoma results in increased cupping and pallor within the cup, but not pallor of the remaining rim tissue. However, rim pallor out of proportion to the degree of cupping may sometimes occur following previous episodes of very high IOP elevation, such as following an episode of acute angle closure. The ophthalmologist must also consider drusen or coloboma as possible causes of optic nerve change and visual field loss. Finally, the myopic optic disc represents a challenge when the ophthalmologist is attempting to assess possible glaucomatous damage. The size, tilting, and associated structural changes often preclude the ability to definitively determine the presence of glaucomatous damage.</p>

			<p class="h3">Recording of optic nerve findings</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Due to the large variability in the appearance of the optic nerve head in healthy subjects, it is frequently not possible to confirm the presence of glaucomatous damage based on a single cross-&#173;sectional observation. Therefore, glaucoma diagnosis frequently requires longitudinal monitoring and detection of progressive damage over time. Careful documentation is essential in order to allow adequate comparison of the optic nerve head appearance over time, both for diagnosis of the disease in individuals suspected of having glaucoma, and for detection of progression in those with established disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is common practice to grade an optic nerve head by comparing the diameter of the cup with the diameter of the disc. This ratio is usually expressed as a decimal, for example, 0.2; but such a description poorly conveys the appearance of the nerve head. A detailed, annotated diagram of the optic nerve head topography is preferable to the recording of a simple cup–disc ratio. The diagram must be of adequate size to allow depiction of important topographic landmarks and morphologic features. With annotation, the diagram can convey the cup–disc ratio along all dimensions and serves to document the presence or absence of regions of rim thinning, notching, hemorrhage, and peripapillary atrophy. However, even very well-&#173;detailed descriptions or drawings of the optic nerve head are generally insufficient to detect the subtle changes that may occur as the result of glaucomatous progression over time. Therefore, objective documentation of the appearance of the optic nerve head by photographs or imaging should be obtained whenever possible.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Photography, particularly simultaneous stereophotography, is an excellent method for recording the appearance of the optic nerve for detailed examination and sequential follow-&#173;up. This record allows the examiner to compare the present status of the patient with the baseline status without resorting to memory or grading systems. If stereoscopic photographs are not available, even simple monoscopic photographs are preferable to drawings in documenting the appearance of the optic nerve head. However, evaluation of optic nerve head photographs is subjective and does not provide direct quantitative information about the degree of neural loss or rates of disease progression.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-20">Imaging of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Since the 1850s, the appearance of the optic nerve head has been recognized as critical in assessing the disease status of glaucoma. However, assessment of the optic nerve head at the slit-lamp or through photographs is subjective and shows relatively large interobserver and intraobserver variation. Advancements in ocular imaging technologies over the last 3&#160;decades include optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (CSLO), and scanning laser polarimetry (SLP). Imaging devices provide an objective means to obtain reproducible and high-&#173;resolution images of ocular structures relevant to glaucoma. In addition, imaging devices contain normative databases that allow one to determine the probability that observed measurements are within the normal range, assisting in the differentiation of optic nerve damage from normal variation. Imaging assessment is also helpful for detecting progressive structural damage and for assessment of rates of disease progression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Of current imaging technologies, OCT offers the greatest versatility and has evolved considerably since first used to image the eye in 1991. OCT employs the principles <br />of low-&#173;coherence interferometry and is analogous to ultrasound B-mode imaging, but it uses light instead of sound to acquire high-&#173;resolution images of ocular structures. The original OCT technology of time-&#173;domain OCT (TD-OCT) has been superseded by Fourier- or spectral-&#173;domain OCT (SD-OCT), which has improved spatial resolution and image acquisition speed, resulting in enhanced image quality and greater reproducibility. OCT is able to provide measurements of the peripapillary RNFL thickness, which have been shown to discriminate glaucomatous from healthy eyes. OCT RNFL thickness measurements are in general decreased in glaucomatous eyes compared to those in normal eyes, although considerable inter-&#173;individual variability exists. Measurements parameters obtained by OCT have generally included the global average peripapillary RNFL thickness, corresponding to the average of all thickness measurements in a peripapillary circle around the optic nerve head, as well as parameters measuring thickness by quadrants (superior, inferior, temporal, nasal) or in small clock-hour sectors. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;3-18</span> shows an example of RNFL analysis provided by SD-OCT in a patient with glaucomatous RNFL loss in the right eye and normal RNFL in the left <br />eye. RNFL analysis with OCT has also been shown to detect glaucomatous damage in some eyes before the appearance of visual field defects on standard automated perimetry (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-19</span>) and to be predictive of development of future visual field losses in glaucoma suspect eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In recent years, increased attention has been directed toward the macular region for evaluation of glaucomatous damage. As a large proportion of total macular thickness is composed of RNFL and ganglion cell bodies, this region is an attractive area for identifying structural damage from the disease. The macular RGC layer contains more than 50% of the RGCs of the entire retina. Investigations have also suggested that, in contrary to previous belief, glaucomatous damage frequently affects the macular region, leading to central visual field losses that can go undetected with conventional perimetry.</p>
			<p class="body-text">SD-OCT allows quantitative assessment of either the entire macular thickness or the thickness of specific layers that may be important in glaucoma. Parameters available from SD-OCT analysis of the macular area include, for example, the macular RNFL, the ganglion cell layer with the inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), and the so-called <span class="italic">ganglion cell complex (GCC),</span> which has been described as comprising the RNFL, the ganglion cell layer, and the inner plexiform layer. Macular parameters are able to distinguish glaucomatous eyes from those of healthy subjects; however, their additional benefit over peripapillary RNFL assessment is still not well established. In eyes with myopic discs or large areas of peripapillary atrophy, which can present with artifacts on peripapillary RNFL assessment, it is likely that macular evaluation may provide increased ability to diagnose and monitor glaucomatous damage. SD-OCT is also able to provide tridimensional topographical measurements of the optic nerve head, including optic nerve head area, neuroretinal rim area and volume, as well as cup area and volume.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although previous versions of OCT technology (TD-OCT) were also able to provide such measurements, a large amount of data interpolation was required, resulting in poor reproducibility and accuracy of the measurements. The improved resolution and velocity of scan acquisition of SD-OCT have greatly reduced the need for interpolation, resulting in much better delineation of optic nerve head structures. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;3-20</span> shows measurements obtained from different scanning areas (RNFL, optic nerve head, and macula) with SD-OCT.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy</span> is another technology that can be used for assessing glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve head. The optical design of instruments using confocal scanning laser technology allows for a series of tomographic slices, or optical sections, of the structure being imaged. Parameters such as cup area, cup volume, rim volume, cup–disc ratio, and peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness are then calculated based on the location of the vitreoretinal interface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">scanning laser polarimeter</span> is a scanning laser ophthalmoscope outfitted with a polarization modulator and detector to take advantage of the birefringent properties of the RNFL in order to estimate its thickness. The birefringence of the RNFL arises from the predominantly parallel nature of the axonal microtubule substructure. As light passes through the nerve fiber layer, the polarization state changes. The deeper layers of retinal tissue reflect the light back to the detector, where the degree to which the polarization has been changed is recorded. The fundamental parameter being measured with this instrumentation is <span class="italic">relative</span> (not absolute) RNFL thickness. The addition of a variable corneal compensator and an enhanced corneal compensator to include analysis of potential anterior segment birefringence has improved the quality of the information available with this technique.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although imaging devices are largely used as ancillary tests aimed at detecting early signs of glaucomatous damage, perhaps their greatest value is in the longitudinal monitoring of structural damage by serial imaging over time. Several investigations have shown that imaging parameters, such as RNFL thickness or rim area, are able to detect progressive glaucomatous damage. In addition, these parameters can provide quantitative assessment of rates of change in the disease, which are essential in establishing appropriate treatment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-21</span>). Although most glaucoma patients will show some evidence of progression if followed long enough, the rate of deterioration can be highly variable among them. While most patients progress relatively slowly, others have aggressive disease with fast deterioration, which can eventually result in blindness or substantial impairment unless appropriate interventions take place. Importantly, progressive structural damage may occur despite lack of detectable visual field deterioration. These structural changes, however, have been shown to predict future functional deterioration in glaucoma patients. Therefore, comprehensive assessment of glaucomatous damage should involve both structural and functional evaluations.</p>

			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-22">&#9;2.&#9;longitudinal assessment to detect glaucomatous progression and measure rates of change</p>
			<p class="body-text">Quantification of visual field sensitivity enables detection of visual field defects by comparison with normative data. Regular visual field testing in known cases of disease provides valuable information for helping to differentiate between stability and progressive loss.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Automated static perimetry is currently the standard method for assessing visual function in glaucoma. With this method, threshold sensitivity measurements are usually performed at a number of test locations using white stimuli on a white background; this is known as <span class="italic">standard automated perimetry (SAP),</span> or achromatic automated perimetry. Automated static perimetry has largely replaced manual kinetic perimetry, which is now rarely performed for visual field assessment in glaucoma. However, manual kinetic perimetry may be helpful for monitoring visual fields in patients who are unable to perform the automated test.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Factors Affecting Perimetry Results</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many factors may affect the results obtained from perimetry, including the patient’s level of attentiveness, the perimetrist’s administration of the test, and other variables, such as refractive correction. The interaction between the perimetrist and the patient is fundamental to enhance the chances of successful perimetric testing.</p>
			<p class="h3">Patient</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">People vary in their attentiveness and response time from moment to moment and from day to day. Longer tests are more likely to produce fatigue and diminish the ability of the patient to maintain peak performance.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Perimetrist</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although the influence of the perimetrist on the results of automated perimetry is in general smaller than with manual perimetry, the perimetrist still plays a fundamental role in the outcome of the test. It is important to instruct the patient about what to expect during the test, such as how long the test will take, when to blink, what the stimulus will look like, and where it might appear. Also, it is important to advise patients that the stimuli are likely to be barely visible throughout the test, and that more than half of the stimuli shown in a threshold test will not be visible. This can decrease a patient’s anxiety and improve cooperation during the test. In addition, the perimetrist should explain to the patient how he or she could pause the test if necessary. The patient should be monitored during the test, to ensure proper positioning and fixation, and the perimetrist should be available to intervene if necessary to ensure proper testing conditions.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Other factors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several other factors may affect the results of perimetry, including background luminance, stimulus luminance, and size of the stimulus. In automated perimetry, these variables are standardized according to the specific testing strategy being employed, allowing reliable comparisons of tests obtained with the same strategy over time.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other factors that may affect perimetry results include patient refraction and pupil size. Uncorrected refractive errors cause blurring on the retina and decrease the visibility of stimuli. Thus, proper neutralization of refractive errors is essential for accurate perimetry. In addition, presbyopic patients must have a refractive compensation that focuses fixation at the depth of the perimeter bowl. Care needs to be taken to center the patient close to the correcting lens to avoid a lens rim artifact. A small pupil (&lt;2.5&#160;mm) may produce artifacts on perimetry by reducing the amount of light entering the eye. However, such artifacts are now rare because of the less common use of miotics.</p>
			<p class="h2">Automated Static Perimetry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A computerized perimeter must be able to determine differential light sensitivity at multiple points in the retina, to perform an adequate test in a reasonable amount of time, and to present results in a comprehensible form. Various strategies have been used in order to obtain reliable and efficient estimates of threshold visual sensitivity in perimetry.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) perimeter (Carl-Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA), the Swedish interactive threshold algorithm (SITA) has largely replaced the older full-&#173;threshold strategy as the standard method for threshold measurement. SITA is a Bayesian test strategy that uses prior information from previous evaluations of healthy individuals and persons with disease to generate a probability distribution function (PDF) representing the probabilities that the visual field sensitivity will be of a particular value at a particular visual field location. As the test progresses, the distribution is then adjusted, according to whether or not the person being tested responds to the stimulus presentations. This continues until the PDF distribution is within a small range, at which point the mean of the distribution is selected as the threshold sensitivity estimate. The PDFs are adjusted for the age of the individual, the visual field location tested, the sensitivity values of neighboring test locations, and the results of previous stimulus presentations. SITA has been demonstrated to have equal or lower test–retest variability compared with conventional staircase procedures employed in the older full-&#173;threshold strategy, and testing can often be done in half the time.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The SITA strategy is available in the Humphrey perimeters as SITA Standard and SITA Fast. SITA Standard is usually the strategy of choice. SITA Fast is even faster than SITA Standard and may have similar accuracy and reliability; however, it may be a more difficult test for the patient because the test stimuli tend to be closer to the patient’s threshold, thus offering less positive feedback to the patient. Patients who are perceived to have difficulties with SITA Standard should not be shifted to SITA Fast; they should continue with SITA Standard. These patients will generally benefit from careful instruction by the perimetrist, closer surveillance, and positive feedback.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Similar to the SITA test strategy for the HFA, the <span class="italic">tendency-&#173;oriented perimeter (TOP)</span> algorithm was developed for the Octopus perimeter (Haag-Streit, Mason, OH) as an alternative to the lengthy staircase threshold procedures. However, TOP is distinct from SITA in that only 1&#160;stimulus is shown at a single location of the visual field. Therefore, in order to estimate the threshold sensitivity at a particular location, TOP supplements this single data point per test location with information obtained at adjoining test locations.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Threshold tests</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common programs for glaucoma testing are the central 24° and 30° programs, such as the Octopus&#160;32 and G1 and the Humphrey 24-2 and 30-2 (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-22</span>). These programs test the central field using a 6° grid. They test points 3° above and 3° below the horizontal midline and facilitate diagnosis of defects that respect this line. A 24-2 test performed with the SITA Standard strategy for obtaining threshold estimates is then usually referred to as <span class="italic">SITA Standard 24-2.</span> For patients with advanced visual field loss or with paracentral defects, serial 10-2 or C8 visual field testing should also be used (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-23</span>). These visual fields concentrate on the central 8°–10° of the visual field, and test points every 1°–2°, enabling the ophthalmologist to follow many more test points within the central island and improve detection of progression. Alternatively, a larger stimulus (Size&#160;V) can be used in more advanced patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although a 30°–60° program is available on most static threshold perimeters, it is rarely performed because the threshold variability is very high in these more peripheral regions.</p>
			<p class="h3">Screening tests</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">These tests may or may not be threshold-&#173;related, and they cover varying areas of the visual field. Suprathreshold tests are not recommended for glaucoma suspects because they do not provide a good reference for future comparison. They may be useful with other conditions causing visual field loss, however.</p>
			<p class="h2">Interpretation of a Single Visual Field</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician should exercise caution when interpreting perimetric results. Even with improved strategies, these remain subjective tests. Therefore, confirmation of a new defect or worsening of an existing defect is usually necessary to validate the clinical implication of the visual field in conjunction with all other pertinent data. Evaluation of the visual field involves (1)&#160;assessing the quality or reliability of the visual field test, (2)&#160;assessing the normality or abnormality, and (3)&#160;identifying artifacts.</p>
			<p class="h3">Quality</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The first aspect of the field to be evaluated is its quality or reliability. Reliability indices include the percentage of fixation losses, false-&#173;positives and false-&#173;negatives. Of these, a high percentage of false-&#173;positives is most detrimental to a visual field test. The false-&#173;positive rate measures the tendency of the patient to press the response button even when no stimulus has been seen. Visual fields with a false-&#173;positive rate greater than 15% are likely unreliable and nonrepresentative of the patient’s true field status. A high fixation loss rate (&gt;25%) is also indicative of an unreliable field, especially if accompanied by the lack of a well-&#173;demarcated blind spot. False-&#173;negative rates measure the tendency of the patient to fail to press the button even when a visible stimulus has been presented. Although a high false-&#173;negative rate could indicate an inattentive patient, damaged areas of the visual field show increased variability, which can lead to a high false-&#173;negative rate. Therefore, although the percentage of false-&#173;negatives has also traditionally been included as a reliability index, false-&#173;negative rates can be elevated in abnormal fields regardless of the attentiveness of the patient. Hence, visual field tests should not necessarily be disregarded because of high false-&#173;negative rates.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Normality or abnormality</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The next aspect of the visual field to be assessed is its normality or abnormality. When tested under photopic conditions, the normal visual field demonstrates the greatest sensitivity centrally, with sensitivity falling steadily toward the periphery. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;3-24</span> shows a single field analysis of a visual field obtained with the Humphrey perimeter. The results are presented as a series of numerical plots and probability maps including a threshold sensitivity map with the numerical threshold sensitivities for each location and a corresponding grayscale map; a total deviation plot, showing decibel deviations from age-&#173;corrected normal sensitivities; a total deviation probability map, showing deviations that fall outside the statistical range of normal sensitivity; a pattern deviation map, showing the localized loss after correcting for overall decreases in sensitivity; and a pattern deviation probability map.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Humphrey perimeter also provides a series of summary indices, including Mean Deviation (MD), which is a weighted average of the total deviation values, where zero equates to no deviation from normal and more negative values indicate more advanced loss; Pattern Standard Deviation (PSD), which is a summary index of localized visual field loss; and the Glaucoma Hemifield Test (GHT), which categorizes eyes as within normal limits, borderline, or outside normal limits based on a comparison of visual field sensitivities at corresponding areas of the superior and inferior hemifields. As glaucoma frequently causes asymmetric damage to the superior and inferior hemifields, the GHT offers a powerful tool for identification of glaucomatous visual field defects (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-25</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several criteria have been proposed for identification of visual field abnormalities. A simple and widely accepted criterion is the one employed by the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS). In the OHTS, a visual field defect was defined as the presence of a PSD with <span class="italic">P</span> &lt;5% or the presence of a GHT with a result outside normal limits. The abnormality had to be present in 3&#160;consecutive visual field tests. In the analysis of a visual field printout, it is also important to evaluate the probability maps, especially the pattern deviation probability plot. The presence of a cluster of at least 3&#160;abnormal points (<span class="italic">P</span> &lt;5%) on the pattern deviation plot, with at least 1 of those points with <span class="italic">P</span> &lt;1%, has also been used as criterion for visual field defect.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is important to emphasize that the clinician should examine the visual fields to verify whether the defect is repeatable and present in approximately the same location, and that the abnormalities are not due to the presence of artifacts. Although the points that are abnormal will not be exactly the same in all confirmatory tests, the area of visual field abnormality should be similar among the tests.</p>
			<p class="h3">Artifacts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Identification of artifacts is the next step in evaluation of the visual field. The following are common artifacts seen on automated perimetry:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Lens rim:</span> If the patient’s corrective lens is decentered or set too far from the eye, the lens rim may project into the central 30° (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-26</span>).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Incorrect corrective lens:</span> If an incorrect corrective lens is used, the resulting field will be generally depressed.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Eyelid artifact:</span> Partial eyelid ptosis may lead to an artifactual superior visual field defect.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Cloverleaf visual field:</span> If a patient stops paying attention and ceases to respond partway through a visual field test, a distinctive visual field pattern may develop. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;3-27</span> shows a cloverleaf visual field, the result of the testing order of the Humphrey 30-2 perimeter, which begins testing with the points circled in this figure and proceeds outward. This pattern may also be seen if a patient is malingering.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-12"><span class="italic">High false-&#173;positive rate:</span> When a patient responds at a time when no test stimulus is being presented, a false-&#173;positive response is recorded. False-&#173;positive rates greater than 15% suggest an unreliable test that can mask or minimize an actual scotoma and can, in extreme cases, result in a visual field with impossibly high threshold values (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-28</span>). Careful instruction of the patient may sometimes resolve this artifact.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Patterns of Visual Field Loss in Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The hallmark defect of glaucoma is the nerve fiber bundle defect that results from damage at the optic nerve head. The pattern of nerve fibers in the retinal area served by the damaged nerve fiber bundle will correspond to the specific defect. The common names for the classic visual field defects are derived from their appearance as plotted on a kinetic visual field chart. In static perimetry, however, the sample points are in a grid pattern, and the representation of visual field defects on a static perimetry chart generally lacks the smooth contours suggested by such terms as <span class="italic">arcuate.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Glaucomatous visual field defects include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-14">arcuate or Bjerrum scotoma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-29</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">nasal step (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-30</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">paracentral scotoma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-31</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">altitudinal defect (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-32</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">generalized depression (rare in glaucoma in the absence of localized loss)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-8">temporal wedge (rare)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The superior and inferior poles of the optic nerve appear to be most susceptible to glaucomatous damage. However, damage to small, scattered bundles of optic nerve axons commonly produces a generalized decrease in sensitivity, which is harder to recognize than focal defects. Combinations of superior and inferior visual field loss, such as double arcuate scotomata, may occur, resulting in profound peripheral vision loss. Typically, the central island of vision and the inferotemporal visual field are retained until late in the course of glaucomatous optic nerve damage (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-23</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2">Interpretation of a Series of Visual Fields and Detection <br />of Visual Field Progression</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Interpretation of serial visual fields should meet 2&#160;goals:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-23">&#9;1.&#9;separating real change from ordinary variation</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-24">&#9;2.&#9;using the information obtained from visual field testing to determine the likelihood that a change is related to glaucomatous progression</p>
			<p class="body-text">Visual field testing is a subjective examination, and different responses may be obtained each time the test is performed or even during the same test. This fluctuation can greatly confound the interpretation of change. In order to detect true visual field progression, one needs to evaluate whether the observed change exceeds the expected variability for a particular area.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There are, in general, 2&#160;main approaches to analyzing visual field progression. The first approach is to compare the results of the current examination with those from a previous one (usually set as the baseline). If the results of the follow-&#173;up examination are significantly worse, progression is indicated. This approach is called <span class="italic">event-&#173;based analysis,</span> as it looks for defects on the current examination that were not present before.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the second approach, instead of comparing the current test with a baseline test, one looks for progressive change by analyzing all the tests available in a specific period. This is called <span class="italic">trend-based analysis,</span> as change is observed as a trend in the values plotted over time, and significant deterioration can be assessed by observing the slope or decline of the regression line. In addition to evaluating whether progression has occurred, trend analysis allows estimation of the rate of progression. It is well known that some patients decline faster than others, and estimating each individual’s rate of progression is helpful for predicting the risk of functional impairment and determining how aggressive the treatment should be.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Different tools are available to assist clinicians in identifying visual field progression, and there is no consensus about the best method for detecting change. The simplest and most general method uses the Mean Deviation (MD) index plotted against time. A statistically significant decline would indicate progressive deterioration. Deterioration on the MD index may represent glaucomatous progression or progression of cataract or other media opacities. Conversely, in a glaucoma patient who has undergone cataract surgery, progression may be masked in evaluation by this method.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Humphrey perimeter provides Guided Progression Analysis (GPA) software to assist in detection of visual field progression (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-33</span>). The software presents an event-&#173;based method that is based on the pattern deviation plot and, therefore, adjusts for the potential confounding effects of diffuse loss of sensitivity from media opacities. Detection of new or progressing visual field defects is performed by comparison to the baseline; therefore, it is critical to have reliable baseline examinations. Often, the patient experiences a learning effect, and the second visual field may show substantial improvement over the first. At least 2&#160;visual field tests should be performed as early as possible in the course of a patient’s disease. If the results are quite different, a third test should be performed. The software automatically selects the first 2&#160;available examinations as the baseline tests. However, one can easily override this selection to a more suitable time-point (eg, change in therapy after progression), or to avoid initial learning effects (which could reduce the sensitivity to detect progression). The software then compares each follow-&#173;up test to <br />the average of the baseline tests (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-34</span>). It identifies points that show change greater than the expected variability (at the 95% significance level), as determined by previous studies with stable glaucoma patients. If significant change is detected in at least 3&#160;points and repeated in the same points in 2&#160;consecutive follow-&#173;up tests, the software will flag the last examination as <span class="italic">Possible Progression.</span> If significant change is detected and repeated for the same 3 or more points in 3&#160;consecutive follow-&#173;up tests, the GPA software will flag the last examination as <span class="italic">Likely Progression.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">The most recent version of the GPA software also provides the Visual Field Index (VFI) and VFI progression plot (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-35</span>). The VFI is designed to better evaluate the rate of progression with SAP. The VFI is calculated as the percentage of normal visual field, after adjustment for age. Therefore, a VFI of 100% represents a completely normal visual field, while a VFI of 0% represents a perimetrically blind visual field. The VFI is shown on the GPA printout both as a percentage value for each examination and as a trend analysis, plotted against age. While the MD is based only on the total deviation map, and thus largely affected by cataract, the VFI is based both on the pattern deviation probability map, for the identification of possibly progressing points, and on the total deviation map, used for the actual calculation of change of the total deviation value. In addition, the algorithm uses different weights for different locations, giving more weight to more central points, which have higher impact on the patient’s quality of vision. The final VFI score is the mean of all weighted scores.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Octopus perimeter also provides a comprehensive statistical package (EyeSuite) for evaluation of visual field progression. The software calculates rates of progression in terms of mean defect change per year (in dB/year), similar to the MD index from Humphrey perimetry. In addition, the software provides an analysis of progression by individual test points (pointwise linear regression) and by clusters, where test locations are combined according to nerve fiber bundle patterns.</p>

			<p class="h3">Structure and function correlations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is important to correlate changes in the visual field with those in the optic nerve head. If such correlation is lacking, the ophthalmologist should consider other causes of vision loss, such as ischemic optic neuropathy, demyelinating or other neurologic disease, or pituitary tumor. This consideration is especially important in the following situations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">The patient’s optic nerve head seems less cupped than would be expected for the degree of visual field loss.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The pallor of the optic nerve head is more impressive than the cupping.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The progression of the visual field loss seems excessive.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The pattern of visual field loss is uncharacteristic for glaucoma—for example, it respects the vertical midline.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">The location of the cupping or thinning of the neural rim does not correspond to the proper location of the visual field defect.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">It should be noted, however, that progressive visual field loss may sometimes be seen in the absence of optic nerve head changes and vice versa. In cases of early disease, progressive structural changes to the optic nerve and RNFL can frequently be seen despite lack of apparent visual field progression. Conversely, in cases of more severe disease, progressive visual field losses tend to occur despite lack of detectable structural change. This apparent disagreement may be explained by the different characteristics of the tests, including scaling, variability, and presence of floor/ceiling effects. Therefore, follow-&#173;up of glaucoma patients should be performed using both structural and functional assessments.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-25">Other Perimetric Tests</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Other psychophysical tests of visual function have been developed, including frequency-&#173;doubling technology (FDT), short-&#173;wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP), and flicker-&#173;defined form (FDF) perimetry (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-36</span>). These tests aim to target subpopulations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by evaluating specific aspects of visual function (eg, motion perception, contrast sensitivity, color vision) and thereby reduce the ability of the visual system to use other pathways to compensate. It has been hypothesized that in its early stages, glaucoma may predominately damage magnocellular RGCs projecting to the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (ie, the magnocellular [M] pathway).</p>
			<p class="body-text">FDT perimetry, which determines the contrast sensitivity for detecting a high temporal frequency counter-&#173;phase flicker stimulus, was designed to selectively evaluate the M&#160;pathway; evidence shows that the response to motion perimetry may be generated by many ganglion cell types and is cortically mediated. Nevertheless, FDT has shown promise for glaucoma detection, and longitudinal studies have shown that abnormalities on FDT may precede detectable SAP changes in many patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">SWAP uses a narrow band blue-&#173;violet stimulus (440-nm wavelength) against a bright yellow background illumination. SWAP targets the small bistratified ganglion cells, which project their axons to the koniocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. SWAP has also been modified over the years and now utilizes the SITA strategy to shorten the test duration. Despite these modifications, however, SWAP SITA generally does not have better diagnostic ability than SAP and is now rarely performed in clinical practice.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The FDF stimulus has been proposed as an alternative method for detecting glaucomatous vision loss. FDF perimetry is believed to stimulate the M&#160;pathway, and there is emerging evidence that it may be useful for early glaucoma diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although psychophysical tests such as FDT, SWAP, and FDF perimetry attempt to minimize potential input from other pathways, it is unlikely any stimulus can be 100% specific for a single visual pathway or a single subset of RGCs. Furthermore, there is not a single ganglion cell type that is always affected first in glaucoma. Perimetric tests are also subjective examinations and therefore responses may vary on repeat testing, or during the same test, reducing the ability to confidently detect genuine early abnormalities.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other tests measuring the integrity of the visual field include contrast sensitivity perimetry, flicker sensitivity, microperimetry, visually evoked cortical potential, and multifocal electroretinography. However, these tests are not commonly employed in the evaluation of patients with glaucoma. Several of these tests are discussed in greater detail in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>

Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) may also provide images of the anterior segment and angle. However, although the resolution of AS-OCT is better than that of UBM, penetration through the sclera is minimal with AS-OCT, reducing its ability to provide images of the ciliary body and adjacent structures.</p>
