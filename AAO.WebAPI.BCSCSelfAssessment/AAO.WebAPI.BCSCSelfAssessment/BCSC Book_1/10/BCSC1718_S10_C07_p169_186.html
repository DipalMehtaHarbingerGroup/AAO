			<p class="chapter-title">Medical Management of Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goal of currently available glaucoma therapy is to preserve visual function by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) to a level that is likely to prevent further optic nerve damage. The treatment regimen chosen should achieve this goal with the lowest risk, fewest adverse effects, and the least amount of disruption to the patient’s life, taking into account the cost of treatment. Although the goal of treatment is to prevent vision loss, current treatments are aimed at lowering IOP and, in the short term, the efficacy of treatment is gauged according to the IOP level.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">target pressure</span> is an IOP range below which the clinician estimates the risk of disease progression is sufficiently low so as to minimize the patient’s risk of experiencing further symptomatic vision loss in his or her lifetime. It should be individualized for the patient, based on the following: IOP level at which damage is thought to have occurred; severity of the damage; the previously observed rate of progression (if known); life expectancy of the patient; and risk factors such as a history of disc hemorrhages, high myopia, a thinner cornea, and a family history of severe vision loss in the setting of glaucoma (risk factors are discussed in more detail in Chapter&#160;4).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The more advanced the disease on initial presentation, the lower the target pressure required for preventing further progression in the average patient. Evidence suggests that the severity of optic nerve injury may increase the likelihood of continued disease progression. Furthermore, if severe vision loss is already present, further damage is likely to have a disproportionately greater impact on visual function and quality of life. A reduction in IOP of at least 25% below baseline is a reasonable initial target for most patients with mild to moderate damage. However, there is no guarantee that reducing IOP to the target pressure will prevent disease progression. If further progression does occur, the target pressure may require downward revision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After determining the target pressure, the clinician must decide whether to achieve this goal medically or surgically. Regardless of which option the clinician chooses, the anticipated benefits of any therapeutic regimen should justify the risks; regimens associated with substantial adverse effects should be reserved for patients with a high probability of progressive vision loss. Sometimes it may be necessary to accept an IOP level above the established target pressure because the adverse effects or risks of intensified therapy may be unacceptable. The clinician must consider both the impact of treatment and the impact of the disease on the patient’s overall quality of life.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Initial treatment of ocular hypertension (defined in Chapter&#160;4) and most glaucomas typically involves the use of medications. When starting a patient on a medication, some clinicians favor using a unilateral treatment trial in order to assess the medication’s efficacy; however, the evidence suggests this may be of limited value because of the occurrence of asymmetric IOP fluctuation between fellow eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular hypotensive agents are divided into several classes based on chemical structure and pharmacologic action. The classes in common clinical use include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">prostaglandin analogues</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">adrenergic drugs<ul><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists (nonselective and selective)</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">adrenergic agonists</li></ul></li>

See also BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> for additional discussion of the mechanisms of action of these medications.</p>

			<p class="h1">Prostaglandin Analogues</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top1">
			<p class="h2-h1">Mechanism of Action</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular hypotensive prostaglandin analogues are prodrugs that penetrate the cornea and become biologically active after being hydrolyzed by corneal esterase. These drugs lower IOP by increasing outflow via the uveoscleral pathway and, to a variable extent, decreasing outflow resistance. The precise mechanism by which these changes occur has not been fully determined. It is thought that the ocular hypotensive prostaglandin analogues bind to various prostaglandin receptors, most importantly prostaglandin F<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">a</span> (PGF<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">a</span>), triggering a cascade of events that leads to activation of matrix metalloproteinases. This in turn leads to remodeling of the ciliary body, trabecular meshwork, and possibly scleral extracellular matrix, such that the volume of aqueous able to flow directly through these tissues is increased. Topical prostaglandin analogue therapy has been shown to result in an increase in space between the muscle fascicles within the ciliary body, which is thought to be the primary location of uveoscleral outflow.</p>
			<p class="h2">Available Agents and Dosing Frequency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Currently, 4&#160;prostaglandin analogues are in widespread clinical use: latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost, and tafluprost. Both latanoprost and travoprost reduce IOP by 25%–32%; <br />bimatoprost lowers IOP by 27%–33%. Tafluprost, currently the only preservative-&#173;free prostaglandin analogue ophthalmic solution available in the United States, appears to be slightly less efficacious than latanoprost (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;7-2</span>; see also General Approach to Medical Treatment for discussion of preservatives). All of these drugs are used once daily, usually at night, and are less effective when used twice daily. Because some patients may respond better to one agent in this class than to another, switching drugs after a trial of 4–6&#160;weeks may prove helpful.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Adverse Effects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An adverse effect unique to this class of drugs is the darkening of the iris and periocular skin as a result of an increased number of melanosomes within the melanocytes. Increased iris pigmentation is permanent, and the frequency of this effect depends on baseline eye color. Most published data on this increased pigmentation relate to latanoprost and suggest a risk of up to 33% after 5&#160;years of use. In particular, up to 79% of persons with green-brown irides and up to 85% of persons with hazel (yellow-&#173;brown) irides may be affected, compared with 8% of persons with blue irides. There are no data to suggest that this color change confers any risk to the patient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other adverse effects reported in association with the use of a topical prostaglandin analogue include conjunctival hyperemia (a result of vasodilation and more common with bimatoprost and travoprost), hypertrichosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-1</span>), trichiasis, and distichiasis. These effects appear to be reversible with drug discontinuation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Use of prostaglandin analogue eyedrops has also been associated with the development of <span class="italic">prostaglandin-&#173;associated periorbitopathy,</span> a complex of periorbital abnormalities that includes deepening of the upper eyelid sulcus, upper eyelid ptosis, enophthalmos, inferior scleral show, and possibly a tight orbit. These abnormalities appear to be the result of periorbital fat atrophy. It is not clear whether this periorbitopathy is reversible.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The development or exacerbation of preexisting cystoid macular edema (CME) can occur in certain predisposed eyes (ie, aphakic eyes, pseudophakic eyes with open posterior capsules, and uveitic eyes). Reactivation of herpetic keratitis can occur. A nongranulomatous anterior uveitis may occur as an idiosyncratic reaction in approximately 1% of patients.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1"><span class="CharOverride-2">b</span>-Adrenergic Antagonists</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Mechanism of action</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topical <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists, or <span class="greek-tx-italic">b</span><span class="italic">-blockers,</span> lower IOP by inhibiting cyclic adeno&#173;sine monophosphate (cAMP) production in ciliary epithelium, thereby reducing aqueous humor secretion by 20%–50% (2.5&#160;µL/min to 1.9&#160;µL/min), with a corresponding IOP reduction of 20%–30%. The effect on aqueous production occurs within 1&#160;hour of instillation and can last for up to 4&#160;weeks after discontinuation of the medication. Because systemic absorption occurs, an IOP-&#173;lowering effect may also be observed in the untreated contralateral eye. <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-Blockers have much less effect on aqueous production during sleep, as aqueous production is already reduced at night; they are thus ineffective in lowering IOP during sleep.</p>
			<p class="h3">Available agents and dosing frequency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the United States and Europe, 6&#160;topical <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists are approved for the treatment of glaucoma: betaxolol, carteolol, levobunolol, metipranolol, timolol maleate, and timolol hemihydrate. Betaxolol, the only <span class="greek--tx-">b</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-selective antagonist of the 6&#160;agents, is less effective in lowering IOP than the others, which are nonselective <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists. Most <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers are approved for twice-&#173;daily therapy. In many cases, the nonselective agents can be used once daily. Generally, dosing first thing in the morning is preferred in order to effectively blunt an early-&#173;morning pressure rise while minimizing the risk of systemic hypotension during sleep. Many nonselective <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers are available in more than one concentration. Clinical experience has shown that in many patients, timolol maleate 0.25% is as effective as timolol maleate 0.5% in lowering IOP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Approximately 10%–20% of the patients treated with topical <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers fail to respond with a significantly lower IOP. Patients already taking a systemic <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker may experience little additional IOP lowering from the addition of a topical <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker. Extended use of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers may reduce their effectiveness, because the response of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic receptors is affected by constant exposure to an agonist (as in long-term drift or tachyphylaxis). Similarly, receptor saturation (drug-&#173;induced upregulation of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic receptors) may occur within a few weeks of starting these drugs, with loss of effectiveness (eg, short-term escape).</p>
			<p class="h3">Adverse effects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ocular and systemic adverse effects of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists are listed in Table&#160;7-1. Plasma drug levels from topical medications can approach those achieved with systemic administration because of the lack of first-pass hepatic metabolism with topical administration and because of their absorption in the nasolacrimal drainage system. However, administering topical medications in a gel vehicle results in reduced systemic absorption and decreased plasma concentrations of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers compared with the equivalent solution.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic adverse effects of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists include bronchospasm, bradycardia, increased heart block, lowered blood pressure, reduced exercise tolerance, and central nervous system (CNS) depression. Patients with diabetes mellitus may experience reduced glucose tolerance and masking of hypoglycemic signs and symptoms. In addition, abrupt withdrawal of ocular <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers can exacerbate symptoms of hyperthyroidism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Before a <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker is prescribed, the clinician should ask whether the patient has a history of asthma, as <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers may induce severe, life-&#173;threatening bronchospasm in susceptible patients. Because betaxolol is a selective <span class="greek--tx-">b</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>&#160;antagonist, it is safer than the nonselective <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers for use in patients with asthma; <span class="greek--tx-">b</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>&#160;receptors are present in bronchial smooth muscle cells and their inhibition results in bronchospasm in susceptible individuals. In addition, betaxolol may be less likely to cause depression. However, <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker–<br />related adverse effects can still occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prior to initiation of therapy with a topical <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker, the patient’s pulse should be measured; <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers should be withheld if the pulse rate is slow or if more than first-&#173;degree heart block is present. Administration of topical <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers has been associated with the development of signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis in patients without a preexisting diagnosis and can exacerbate the condition in patients already known to have the disease. The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other adverse effects of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers include lethargy, mood changes, depression, altered mentation, light-&#173;headedness, syncope, visual disturbance, corneal anesthesia, punctate keratitis, allergy, impotence, reduced libido, and alteration of serum lipids. In children, <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers should be used with caution, because of the relatively high systemic levels achieved.</p>

			<p class="h2">Adrenergic Agonists</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The nonselective adrenergic agonists epinephrine (adrenaline) and dipivefrin (a prodrug of epinephrine) reduce aqueous humor production, increase uveoscleral outflow, and improve conventional outflow facility. Both have largely been superseded by other classes of drugs and are now rarely used in the management of glaucoma.</p>

The <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenoceptor found on the ciliary epithelium is coupled to an inhibitory G&#160;protein. When this adrenoceptor is bound by catecholamines or pharmacologically active <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-4">2</span>-agonists, it is thought that an intracellular cascade results in reduction in the activity of adenylate cyclase and the intracellular concentration of cAMP, with a resultant reduction in the rate of aqueous humor production. An alternate or possibly complementary mechanism by which aqueous humor production is reduced may be anterior segment vasoconstriction and reduced blood flow to the ciliary body. After a longer period of therapy, increased uveoscleral outflow has also been observed with the selective <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonist brimonidine, but not with apraclonidine. How uveoscleral outflow may be increased with brimonidine is unclear, but evidence points to relaxation of ciliary smooth muscle cells.

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Available agents and dosing frequency</span> Brimonidine tartrate is the most commonly used <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-4">2</span>-adrenergic agonist. Apraclonidine hydrochloride (para-&#173;aminoclonidine), an &#173;<span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-4">2</span>-adrenergic agonist and clonidine derivative, is rarely used for long-term therapy because of the frequent occurrence of tachyphylaxis and a hypersensitivity reaction that can cause blepharoconjunctivitis. Apraclonidine is typically used perioperatively to diminish acute IOP spikes that may occur after laser iridotomy, laser trabeculoplasty, Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy, and cataract extraction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Brimonidine is similarly effective when used perioperatively. In addition, tachyphylaxis is less profound with brimonidine than with apraclonidine. Brimonidine’s peak IOP reduction is approximately 26% (2&#160;hours post dose), which is comparable to the reduction achieved by a nonselective <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker and superior to that of the selective <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker betaxolol. At trough (12&#160;hours post dose), the reduction is only 14%–15%, or less than the reduction achieved with nonselective <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers. Studies have shown that brimonidine does not lower nocturnal IOP. Though approved for therapy 3&#160;times daily in the United States, brimonidine is commonly used twice daily, particularly when used in combination with at least one other agent.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Adverse effects</span> The incidence of ocular allergic reactions (eg, follicular conjunctivitis and contact blepharodermatitis; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-2</span>) is lower with brimonidine than with apraclonidine: less than 15% for brimonidine tartrate 0.2% preserved with benzalkonium chloride, and less than 10% for brimonidine tartrate 0.1% preserved with sodium chlorite (Purite). Cross-&#173;sensitivity to brimonidine in patients with known hypersensitivity to apraclonidine is minimal. The incidence of long-term intolerance to brimonidine due to local adverse effects, however, is high (&gt;20%). Granulomatous anterior uveitis is rare but has been reported in association with the use of brimonidine.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-Selective agonists have some <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-binding activity. The ocular effects of &#173;<span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-adrenergic agonists include conjunctival vasoconstriction, pupillary dilation, and eyelid retraction. Apraclonidine has a much greater affinity for <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-receptors than does brimonidine and is therefore more likely to produce these effects.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic adverse effects of <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-4">2</span>-selective agonists include xerostomia (dry mouth) and lethargy, both mediated by their clonidine-&#173;like CNS activity.

			<p class="h1">Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Mechanism of Action</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) decrease aqueous humor production by inhibiting the activity of ciliary epithelial carbonic anhydrase. Systemic CAI therapy may further decrease aqueous humor formation because of the resultant renal metabolic acidosis, which may interfere with activity of ciliary epithelial Na<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-ATPase. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is present in many tissues, including corneal endothelium, iris, retinal pigment epithelium, red blood cells, brain, and kidney. More than 90% of the ciliary epithelial enzyme activity must be abolished to decrease aqueous production and lower IOP.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Available Agents and Dosing Frequency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The topical CAI agents, dorzolamide and brinzolamide, are available for long-term treatment of elevated IOP and have fewer systemic adverse effects than the systemic CAIs. In the United States, they are currently approved for use 3&#160;times daily, but most clinicians prescribe them for twice-&#173;daily use in many patients. Thrice-&#173;daily dosing results in slightly greater IOP reduction. For patients taking an oral CAI, there is no advantage to adding a topical CAI.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic CAIs can be given orally or intravenously and are most useful in acute situations (eg, acute primary angle closure). Oral CAIs begin to act within 1&#160;hour of administration, with maximal effect within 2–4&#160;hours, whereas intravenous CAIs begin to act within 15&#160;minutes. Sustained-&#173;release acetazolamide can reach peak effect within 3–6&#160;hours of administration. Because of the adverse effects of systemic CAIs, however, long-term therapy should be reserved for patients whose glaucoma is not controlled with topical therapy and who have refused surgery or in whom surgery would be inappropriate.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most commonly used oral CAIs are acetazolamide and methazolamide. Methazolamide has a longer duration of action and is less bound to serum protein than is acetazolamide; however, it is less effective than acetazolamide. Methazolamide and sustained-&#173;release acetazolamide are the best tolerated of the systemic CAIs. Methazolamide is metabolized by the liver. Acetazolamide, which is not metabolized, is excreted by the kidney; it must be used with caution and at an adjusted dose in patients with renal insufficiency.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because oral CAIs are potent medications with significant adverse effects (see the following subsection), the lowest dose that reduces the IOP to an acceptable range should be used. Methazolamide is often effective in doses as low as 25–50&#160;mg, given 2 or 3&#160;times daily. Sustained-&#173;release formulations of acetazolamide may have fewer adverse effects than its standard formulation. The typical dosage of acetazolamide is 250&#160;mg 4&#160;times a day; for sustained release, it is 500&#160;mg twice a day.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Adverse Effects and Contraindications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Common adverse effects of topical CAIs include bitter taste, blurred vision, burning upon instillation, and punctate keratopathy. Dorzolamide, a solution, may cause burning, as it is formulated at a low pH due to the low solubility of the molecule at physiologic pH levels. Use of brinzolamide, a suspension, results in white deposits in the tear film. Eyes with compromised endothelial cell function may also be at risk of corneal decompensation with use of either of these drugs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adverse effects of systemic CAI therapy are usually dose-&#173;related and are primarily driven by the resultant metabolic acidosis. Many patients develop paresthesias of the fingers or toes and report loss of energy and anorexia. Weight loss is common. Severe mental depression, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, loss of libido, impotence, and taste disturbance, especially with carbonated beverages, may also occur. There is a risk of sickle cell crisis in sickle cell anemia and an increased risk of formation of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate renal stones. Because methazolamide causes less acidosis, it may be less likely than acetazolamide to cause renal lithiasis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As the urine becomes more alkaline, ammonia excretion is reduced. Systemic CAIs should be avoided in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, as either systemic agent can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy due to increased serum ammonia levels.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CAIs are chemically derived from sulfa drugs and thus may cause an allergic reaction in individuals with sulfa allergies; however, the level of cross-&#173;reactivity is low. Aplastic anemia is a rare but potentially fatal idiosyncratic reaction to CAIs. Thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis can also occur. Although routine complete blood counts have been suggested, they are not predictive of this idiosyncratic reaction and are not routinely recommended. Hypokalemia is a potentially serious complication that is especially likely to occur when an oral CAI is used concurrently with another drug that causes potassium loss (eg, a thiazide diuretic). Serum potassium should be monitored regularly in such patients.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Parasympathomimetic Agents</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Parasympathomimetic agents, or <span class="italic">miotics,</span> have been used in the treatment of glaucoma for more than 100&#160;years. Traditionally, they are divided into direct-&#173;acting cholinergic agonists and indirect-&#173;acting anticholinesterase agents.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The direct-&#173;acting agent pilocarpine continues to be used in certain circumstances, although it is not commonly prescribed for long-term use. In patients with pigmentary glaucoma, pilocarpine is effective in blunting the IOP spike that can occur with jarring physical activities such as running. This drug is also useful in the management of plateau iris syndrome. It has been associated with poor patient adherence to the treatment regimen because of its adverse effect profile and because of its 3 or 4&#160;times-&#173;daily dosing; therefore, it is infrequently used.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Indirect-&#173;acting agents fell out of favor because of their ocular and systemic adverse effects. The indirect-&#173;acting agents can be very effective and well tolerated in aphakic eyes with glaucoma, but they are rarely used.</p>
			<p class="h2">Mechanism of Action</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Parasympathomimetics reduce IOP by causing the longitudinal ciliary muscle fibers that insert into the scleral spur and trabecular meshwork to contract, thereby improving outflow facility. Direct-&#173;acting agents affect the motor end plates in the same way as acetylcholine, which is transmitted at postganglionic parasympathetic junctions, as well as at other autonomic, somatic, and central synapses. Pilocarpine can reduce IOP by 15%–25%. Indirect-&#173;acting agents inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, thereby prolonging and enhancing the action of naturally secreted acetylcholine.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The currently accepted indications for miotic therapy include long-term treatment of elevated IOP in patients whose drainage angles are persistently occludable despite laser iridotomy (plateau iris syndrome).</p>
			<p class="h2">Adverse Effects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Miotic agents have been associated with numerous ocular side effects. Induced myopia resulting from ciliary muscle contraction is a side effect of all cholinergic agents; brow ache may accompany the ciliary spasm. The miosis interferes with vision in dim light conditions; in patients with lens opacities, vision is affected in all light conditions. Because miotic agents have been associated with retinal detachment, a peripheral retinal evaluation is suggested before the initiation of therapy. Miotics, particularly the indirect-&#173;acting agents, may be cataractogenic. In addition, the indirect-&#173;acting agents may induce formation of iris pigment epithelial cysts, may cause epiphora by both direct lacrimal stimulation and punctal stenosis, and may cause ocular surface changes that result in drug-&#173;induced ocular pseudopemphigoid.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other potential ocular adverse effects include increased bleeding during surgery and increased inflammation and severe fibrinous iridocyclitis postoperatively. Because miotics can break down the blood–aqueous barrier, they should be avoided if possible in patients with uveitic glaucoma. Use of miotics occasionally induces a paradoxical angle closure, particularly in eyes with phacomorphic narrow angles; contraction of the ciliary muscle leads to forward movement of the lens–iris interface and increased anteroposterior lens diameter, which may cause or exacerbate pupillary block in an eye with a large lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic adverse effects, seen mainly with indirect-&#173;acting medications, include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, increased salivation, bronchospasm, and even enuresis. Depolarizing muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine cannot be used for up to 6&#160;weeks after stopping indirect-&#173;acting agents.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Combined Medications</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Medications combined in a single bottle have the potential benefits of improved convenience and patient adherence, as well as reduced cost. Fixed combinations consisting of timolol and another agent—a CAI (dorzolamide or brinzolamide), an <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonist (brimonidine), or a prostaglandin analogue (latanoprost, travoprost, or bimatoprost)—are available in many countries (see Table&#160;7-1). In addition, a fixed combination of brimonidine and brinzolamide is available.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, the efficacy of fixed-&#173;combination formulations is similar to that of the components instilled separately. In the case of fixed-&#173;combination agents that include a <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker, the total amount of that agent administered may actually be more than necessary, because nearly the full effect of a <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker can be achieved with once-&#173;daily dosing. The ocular adverse effects are the same as for both drugs given individually. In general, except in the setting of an acutely elevated or dangerously high IOP, the clinician should make sure each component of the fixed combination is effective in further lowering the IOP by adding the individual components sequentially.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Hyperosmotic Agents</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hyperosmotic agents are used to control acute episodes of elevated IOP. Common hyperosmotic agents include oral glycerol and intravenous mannitol.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When given systemically, hyperosmotic agents increase the blood osmolality, which creates an osmotic gradient between the blood and the vitreous humor, drawing water from the vitreous cavity and reducing IOP. Because of the increased gradient, the larger the dose administered and the more rapid the administration, the greater the subsequent IOP reduction. A substance distributed only in extracellular water (eg, mannitol), is more effective than a drug distributed in total body water (eg, urea). The osmotic agent enters the eye faster when the blood–aqueous barrier is disrupted than when it is intact, reducing the effectiveness of the drug and its duration of action.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hyperosmotic agents are rarely administered for longer than a few hours because their effects are transient (a result of the rapid reequilibration of the osmotic gradient). They become less effective over time, and a rebound elevation in IOP may occur if the agent penetrates the eye and reverses the osmotic gradient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adverse effects of these drugs include headache, confusion, backache, acute congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction. The rapid increase in extracellular volume and cardiac preload caused by hyperosmotic agents may precipitate or aggravate congestive heart failure. Intravenous administration is more likely to cause this problem than oral administration. In addition, subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages have been reported after treatment with hyperosmotic agents. Glycerol can precipitate hyperglycemia or even ketoacidosis in patients with diabetes mellitus, because it is metabolized into sugar and ketone bodies. Like oral CAIs, hyperosmotics are contraindicated in patients in renal failure or on dialysis.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">General Approach to Medical Treatment</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top7">
			<p class="h2-h1">Long-Term Therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ophthalmologist should tailor therapy for open-&#173;angle glaucoma to the individual needs of the patient, including establishing a target IOP. Though important, IOP is only one of several factors to monitor. The effectiveness of the therapy can be determined only by careful, repeated scrutiny of the patient’s optic nerve, retinal nerve fiber layer, and visual field status (see Chapter&#160;3).</p>
			<p class="body-text">As mentioned, characteristics of the medical agents available for the treatment of glaucoma are summarized in Table&#160;7-1. When making management decisions, ophthalmologists should keep in mind the efficacy, side effect profile, and cost of the drug, as well as the likelihood of patient adherence to the drug regimen. Treatment is usually initiated with a single topical medication, unless the baseline IOP is extremely high, in which case 2 or more medications may be indicated. A discussion with the patient regarding treatment options can be beneficial for determining the optimal choice.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prostaglandin analogues, <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers, <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonists, and topical CAIs are all reasonable choices as first-line therapy for open-&#173;angle glaucoma, as is laser trabeculoplasty; however, prostaglandin analogues are the most commonly utilized because of their superior efficacy, once-&#173;daily dosing, and favorable safety profile. Although the local adverse effects of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers are minimal, the potential systemic adverse effects of these drugs are significant and they lack nocturnal IOP-&#173;lowering efficacy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If one agent is not adequate to reduce the IOP to the desired range, the initial agent may be discontinued and another tried. If no single agent controls the pressure, a combination of topical agents should be used. Again, customizing the choice of agent to the patient’s needs is helpful when selecting additional medication(s). In unusual circumstances, this might include miotic therapy for patients with aphakia and, in some instances, systemic CAIs for short periods when the clinical situation warrants the risk of adverse effects associated with CAI use. Clearly, when 3 or more medications are required, patient adherence to the medication regimen becomes more difficult and the potential for local and systemic adverse effects increases. Laser trabeculoplasty is a reasonable choice for initial or add-on therapy (see Chapter&#160;8 for more information on this procedure). Further, patients may not be able to tolerate multiple topical agents because of preservative toxicity. Benzalkonium chloride (BAK), the agent most commonly used as a preservative, is present in most of the currently available topical ophthalmic eyedrops. If a reaction is suspected, an ocular hypotensive agent with an alternative preservative or preservative-&#173;free formulation can be used (see Table&#160;7-2).</p>
			<p class="body-text">For rehabilitation of the ocular surface, it may be beneficial to stop all topical medications—if the level of glaucomatous damage permits—and have the patient use preservative-&#173;free artificial tears frequently. During this period, the temporary use of oral CAIs may be helpful to lower IOP, if clinically warranted.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients sometimes fail to associate systemic adverse effects with topical drugs and, consequently, seldom volunteer symptoms. The ophthalmologist must make sure to inquire about these symptoms. In addition, communicating with the primary care physician is important not only to provide information about the potential adverse effects of glaucoma medication but also to discuss the effects that other currently prescribed medications (eg, for systemic disease) might have on the glaucomatous process. Modification of oral <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker therapy for hypertension, for example, may affect IOP.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Therapy for Acute Intraocular Pressure Elevation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goal of medical treatment of acute IOP elevation is usually lowering IOP in order to prevent further damage to the optic nerve; clearing the cornea of edema, if present; and reducing intraocular inflammation. Hyperosmotic agents and systemic CAIs may be required in order to lower the IOP in eyes with acute IOP elevation prior to definitive treatment. In the case of acute primary angle closure, lowering the IOP also facilitates pupillary constriction before an iridotomy is performed (see Chapter&#160;5).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Administration of Ocular Medications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients should be shown how to instill eyedrops properly and should be given instruction on nasolacrimal occlusion, which can be used to reduce the systemic absorption of topical ocular medications and to prolong their ocular contact time. Directing the patient to close the eyes for 1–3&#160;minutes after instillation of the eyedrop will also promote corneal penetration and reduce systemic absorption of the drug by reducing the flow of medication-&#173;containing tears into the nasolacrimal drainage system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Proper instillation procedures are especially important with the use of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers, <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonists, and topical CAIs (to minimize the likelihood of taste disturbance). In addition, these procedures ensure that there is a sufficient amount of time between the instillation of different medications; eyedrops that need to be administered at the same time should be separated by at least 5&#160;minutes to prevent washout of the first drug by the second. Patients should be taught how to space their medications, and instructional charts should be given. A dosing aid device may also be considered, especially for patients who live alone or who are unable to successfully instill eyedrops.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Use of Glaucoma Medications During Pregnancy or by Breastfeeding Mothers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Often, IOP decreases during pregnancy, both in healthy subjects and in patients with glaucoma. However, glaucoma patients who are pregnant frequently continue to require ocular hypotensive medical therapy throughout the pregnancy. As mentioned previously, topical ocular hypotensive medications are systemically absorbed; they subsequently cross the placenta and enter the fetal circulation or can be secreted into breast milk.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Unfortunately, there is little definitive information concerning the safety of glaucoma medication use in pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers. In the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug classification system, the rating <span class="italic">Pregnancy Category&#160;B</span> indicates that animal studies of the drug have revealed no harm to the fetus, but no adequate and well-&#173;controlled studies have been done in pregnant women; or, animal studies of this drug have shown an adverse effect, but adequate and well-&#173;controlled studies in pregnant woman have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus. The <span class="italic">Pregnancy Category&#160;C</span> rating indicates that no animal studies have been conducted and that it is not known whether the drug can cause harm when given to a pregnant woman. The drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly indicated. This category also includes drugs that have shown an adverse effect in animal studies, but there are no adequate and well-&#173;controlled studies of these drugs in pregnant women. Brimonidine is the only glaucoma agent with a Pregnancy Category&#160;B rating; all other agents have a Pregnancy Category&#160;C rating.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There are reports of growth retardation, arrhythmia, bradycardia, and lethargy affecting the fetus or newborn exposed to <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists. These agents are concentrated in breast milk and should be avoided in breastfeeding mothers because of their potential adverse effects on infants. If a <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonist must be used during pregnancy or during breastfeeding, the fetus or infant must be carefully monitored and the lowest effective dose should be utilized.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Brimonidine, though reasonably safe to use during pregnancy, has been reported to cause apnea in infants and young children and should not be used in these patients. Brimonidine should be discontinued prior to delivery to minimize the risk of this complication in the newborn.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The CAIs have been shown to be teratogenic in rodents. Systemic CAIs should be avoided during pregnancy, and it is preferable to avoid the use of topical CAIs in pregnant women, if possible.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because prostaglandins increase uterine contractility and may induce labor, albeit when given at much higher doses than those used in topical therapy, there is a theoretical risk to the pregnancy. With all topical ocular hypotensive medications, pregnant and breastfeeding patients should be advised to perform nasolacrimal occlusion during eyedrop instillation. In general, it is prudent to minimize the use of medications in pregnant women whenever possible. The clinician may want to consider laser trabeculoplasty or other surgical intervention in cases in which the benefits outweigh the potential risks.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Use of Glaucoma Medications in Elderly Patients</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">There are specific considerations regarding the use of glaucoma medications in elderly patients. First, elderly patients generally have greater difficulty instilling their medications than do younger patients; consequently, their adherence to the treatment regimen may be affected. Instillation difficulties may be due to tremor, poor coordination, or a comorbidity such as arthritis. Adherence will also be affected in an elderly patient with reduced mental capacity or poor memory and a complicated drug regimen, especially because this individual is most likely already taking multiple systemic medications for other ailments. Second, elderly persons have a greater susceptibility to the systemic adverse effects of glaucoma medications. The incidence and severity of systemic adverse effects may be higher with <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers and <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonists in these patients. For example, it has been shown that a significant proportion of asymptomatic elderly patients suffer a significant, but reversible, reduction in pulmonary function with the use of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Generic Medications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many glaucoma medications are available as generic drugs. Although the generic agents are required to be chemically or biologically equivalent to the brand-name product, in some cases there may be differences in formulation that could potentially alter a drug’s effect. The use of lower-&#173;cost generic medications has been shown to improve patient adherence to medication regimens.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Patient Adherence to a Medication Regimen</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Glaucoma medications are effective only if patients use them. The first step in improving patient adherence to a medication regimen is patient education. If patients understand the disease and the nature and benefits of treatment, adherence is increased; it is also enhanced when patients are aware of the possible adverse effects of a medication. Patient education should include a discussion of treatment alternatives.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist must make sure that the patient understands the treatment regimen. Simpler medication regimens can improve patient adherence. The fewest number of medications, instilled with the least frequency, is optimal. If the patient requires multiple medications and doses, it may be helpful to coordinate administration with daily events, such as meals or brushing teeth. A written schedule for medications can also be very helpful. Finally, as mentioned previously, proper instillation of eyedrops, by the patient or someone else, is essential and should be confirmed by the ophthalmologist.</p>
