			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Primary open-&#173;angle glaucoma (POAG) is typically a chronic, slowly progressive optic neuropathy with characteristic patterns of optic nerve damage and visual field loss. Numerous clinical factors affect an individual’s susceptibility to POAG, which is a multifactorial disease process. These include elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), advanced age, race, thin central cornea, and a positive family history of glaucoma. Other factors that may contribute to disease susceptibility include corneal hysteresis, low ocular perfusion pressure, low cerebrospinal fluid pressure, abnormalities of axonal or ganglion cell metabolism, and disorders of the extracellular matrix of the lamina cribrosa. Unfortunately, we do not yet fully understand the interplay of the multiple factors involved in the development of POAG. <span class="italic">Secondary</span> OAG differs from POAG in that identifiable factors contribute to its development, such as pigment dispersion in pigmentary glaucoma and the pseudoexfoliative material of pseudoexfoliation syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h2">Clinical Features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">POAG is typically insidious in onset, slowly progressive, and painless. It is usually bilateral but can be quite asymmetric. Patients may seem relatively asymptomatic until the later stages of the disease, when central vision is affected. POAG is diagnosed based on findings from the assessment of the optic nerve and nerve fiber layer and the results of visual field testing.</p>
			<p class="h3">Gonioscopic findings</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">To establish a diagnosis of POAG, the clinician must verify that the anterior chamber angle is open. Gonioscopy (discussed in Chapter&#160;3) should be performed on all patients evaluated for glaucoma and should be repeated periodically in patients with established OAG to monitor for progressive angle closure caused by lens-&#173;induced changes, particularly in patients with hyperopia. Repeated gonioscopy is also indicated when the chamber becomes shallow; when strong miotics are prescribed; after argon laser trabeculoplasty or laser peripheral iridotomy has been performed; or when IOP increases.</p>
			<p class="h3">Optic nerve head appearance and visual fields</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although elevated IOP is an important risk factor for OAG, diagnosis of this disease is based primarily on the appearance of the optic nerve head, or optic disc, and on the results of visual field testing. See Chapter&#160;3 for a detailed discussion of the optic nerve head and visual fields. Careful periodic evaluation of the optic nerve and visual field testing are essential in the management of glaucoma. Stereophotographic documentation of the optic nerve or computerized imaging of the optic nerve or retinal nerve fiber layer aids the detection of subtle changes over time. Visual field loss should correlate with the appearance of the optic nerve; significant discrepancies between the pattern of visual field loss and optic nerve appearance warrant additional investigation, as noted in Chapter&#160;3.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Risk Factors</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Intraocular pressure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Elevated IOP is an important risk factor for glaucoma, but it is not required for a diagnosis of POAG. While large population-&#173;based studies suggest a mean IOP of 15.5&#160;mm&#160;Hg (standard deviation ±2.6) in European-&#173;derived populations, the normal distribution of IOP varies across racial and ethnic groups. This conclusion led to the definition of “normal” IOP as 2&#160;standard deviations above and below the mean IOP, or ranging between 10 and 21&#160;mm&#160;Hg. IOP greater than 21&#160;mm&#160;Hg was thus traditionally defined as “abnormal.” However, this definition has a number of shortcomings.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is known that IOP in the general population is not represented by a Gaussian distribution but rather is skewed toward higher pressures (see Chapter&#160;2, Fig&#160;2-4). Thus, IOPs of 22&#160;mm&#160;Hg and above may not necessarily be abnormal from a statistical standpoint. More importantly, IOP distribution curves for glaucomatous and nonglaucomatous eyes show a great deal of overlap. Several studies indicate that as many as 30%–50% of individuals in the general population with glaucomatous optic neuropathy and/or visual field loss have initial IOP measurements below 22&#160;mm&#160;Hg. Elevations of IOP may occur only intermittently in some glaucomatous eyes, with as many as one-third of these elevated measurements due to normal circadian fluctuation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with glaucoma, IOP may vary considerably—by 10&#160;mm&#160;Hg or more—over a 24-hour period. In contrast, most patients without glaucoma manifest a diurnal range of 2–6&#160;mm&#160;Hg. Spontaneous fluctuations in IOP result in a diurnal pattern that is poorly reproducible, between days or between eyes. Also, in most healthy subjects and glaucoma patients, IOP has a distinct circadian rhythm, with peak pressures often occurring during sleep, particularly in the early-&#173;morning hours (see Chapter&#160;2). About two-thirds of patients reach peak IOPs during nonoffice hours.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thus, a single IOP measurement during office hours does not provide an accurate assessment of IOP variability over time. <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;4-1</span> lists some of the reasons that elevated IOP may be undetected in patients with high-&#173;tension glaucoma. Large diurnal fluctuation in IOP has been identified as an independent risk factor for progression of glaucoma in some studies but not in others. Regardless, elevation of IOP is a strong risk factor for glaucoma progression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As discussed in Chapter&#160;2, central corneal thickness (CCT) affects the measurement of IOP. Thicker corneas resist the deformation inherent in most methods of tonometry, resulting in an overestimation of IOP. In contrast, tonometry in eyes with thin corneas underestimates the IOP. The average CCT in adult eyes, determined by ultrasonic pachy&#173;metry, ranges between 540 and 550&#160;µm and varies with race and ethnicity. For example, in populations of persons of African ancestry, mean CCT is lower than in whites.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Older age</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Baltimore Eye Survey found that the prevalence of glaucoma increases dramatically with age, particularly among individuals of African descent, whose prevalence exceeded 11% in those older than 80&#160;years. In the Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS; see Clinical Trial&#160;4-1 at the end of this chapter), visual field defects were 7&#160;times more likely to progress in patients 60&#160;years or older than in those younger than 40&#160;years. The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS; see Clinical Trial&#160;4-2 at the end of this chapter) found an increased risk of progression to OAG with age (per decade): 43% in the univariate analysis and 22% in the multivariate analysis. In the general population, increased IOP is associated with increased age and may partially account for the observed relationship between age and glaucoma. However, studies from Japan have shown a relationship between increased age and glaucomatous progression in a population with sustained IOP. Therefore, older age appears to be an independent risk factor for the development and progression of glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Race</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The prevalence of POAG in the United States is 3–4&#160;times greater in individuals of African descent or Hispanic ethnicity than in primarily European-&#173;derived populations. Blindness from glaucoma is at least 4&#160;times more common in blacks than in whites. In addition, glaucoma is more likely to be diagnosed in black patients at a younger age and at a more advanced stage than it is in white patients. In the OHTS, glaucoma was 59% more likely to develop in black patients with ocular hypertension (defined in this study as elevated IOP in the absence of optic nerve or visual field abnormalities) than in white patients with ocular hypertension, in a univariate analysis. However, this relationship was not present after controlling for corneal thickness and baseline vertical cup–disc ratio in a multivariate analysis (black patients had overall thinner CCT and larger baseline vertical cup–disc ratios).</p>
			<p class="h3">Thin central corneal thickness</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A thinner cornea is an important risk factor for disease progression in individuals with POAG (with higher baseline IOPs) and for the development of glaucoma in individuals with ocular hypertension. This risk can be attributed, in part, to the underestimation of IOP measured by Goldmann tonometry in patients with thin corneas. In addition, thin corneas may be a biomarker for disease susceptibility. As mentioned previously, black patients have thinner corneas on average than white patients.</p>
			<p class="h3">Positive family history</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the Baltimore Eye Survey, the relative risk of POAG increased approximately 3.7-fold for individuals who had a sibling with POAG.</p>
			<p class="h3">Myopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Population-&#173;based data support an association between POAG and myopia. In the Beaver Dam Eye Study, myopia (≤–1&#160;D spherical equivalent) was significantly associated with a diagnosis of glaucoma. In the Rotterdam follow-&#173;up study, high myopia (≤–4&#160;D spherical equivalent) was associated with an increased risk (2.31&#160;times higher) of development of glaucoma. However, the OHTS did not find an association between myopia and the incidence of glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The concurrence of POAG and myopia may complicate diagnosis and management in several ways. Evaluation of the optic nerve head is particularly challenging in highly myopic eyes that have tilted discs or posterior staphylomas. Also, the myopic refractive error may cause magnification of the optic nerve, further complicating accurate optic nerve assessment. Myopia-&#173;related retinal degeneration or anomalies can cause visual field abnormalities that are difficult to distinguish from those caused by glaucoma. In addition, patients who are highly myopic may have difficulty performing accurately on visual field tests, making interpretation of visual field abnormalities more challenging.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Associated Disorders</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Diabetes mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">There is controversy as to whether diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for glaucoma. The Beaver Dam Eye Study, the Blue Mountains Eye Study, and the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study found an association between diabetes and OAG. However, the Framingham Study, the Baltimore Eye Survey, the Barbados Eye Study, and a revised analysis of the Rotterdam Study did not find a significant association. Furthermore, the Rotterdam Study and the Barbados Eye Study, which were large longitudinal population-&#173;based studies, did not identify diabetes as a risk factor for the development of glaucoma. In the OHTS, diabetes was associated with a reduced risk of developing glaucoma. However, the cohort of diabetic patients was skewed, because the presence of retinopathy was an exclusion criterion for this study.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Hypertension</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Baltimore Eye Survey found that systemic hypertension was associated with a lower risk of glaucoma in younger (&lt;65&#160;years) subjects and a higher risk of glaucoma in older subjects. The hypothesis is that younger individuals with high blood pressure may have better perfusion of the optic nerve, but as these patients age, their chronic hypertension may have adverse effects on the microcirculation of the optic nerve and increase its susceptibility to glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Conversely, in the Barbados Eye Study, the relative risk of developing glaucoma among subjects with systemic hypertension was less than 1.0 in all age groups, including those aged 70&#160;years and older.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Lower ocular perfusion pressure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">There is compelling evidence that lower ocular perfusion pressure (OPP; often defined as diastolic blood pressure + 1/3 systolic blood pressure – IOP) is a risk factor for the development of glaucoma. Although this definition of OPP oversimplifies actual ocular blood flow, several factors, including autoregulatory mechanisms in central nervous system perfusion, make the association between OPP and glaucoma intriguing. The overtreatment of systemic hypertension may contribute to glaucoma progression in some cases (eg, normal-&#173;tension glaucoma) and should be monitored. Clinicians should consider measuring a patient’s blood pressure in the office, particularly if the patient is starting a <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic blocking medication.</p>

			<p class="h3">Retinal vein occlusion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), elevated IOP due to neovascularization of the angle may progress to glaucoma. Thus, routine gonioscopy should be performed in these patients. Also, susceptible individuals with elevated IOP (ie, ocular hypertension or glaucoma) are at risk of developing CRVO. Consideration should be given to treating elevated IOP in patients with a history of CRVO in order to reduce the risk of CRVO in the fellow eye. As the pathophysiology of hemicentral retinal vein occlusion is similar to that of CRVO, treatment considerations should be similar.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Other associated conditions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sleep apnea, thyroid disorders, hypercholesterolemia, migraine headaches, low cerebrospinal fluid pressure, corneal hysteresis, and Raynaud phenomenon have variously been identified in some studies as potential risk factors for the development of glaucoma. Further research is required in order to clarify the significance of these conditions in patients with POAG and their relationship to glaucoma, if any.</p>
			<p class="h2">Prognosis and Therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most patients with POAG retain useful vision for their entire lives. The patients at greatest risk of blindness are those who present with visual field loss at the time of diagnosis. In a recent study, the cumulative risk of unilateral and bilateral blindness in patients with OAG was 7.4% and 3.4%, respectively, within 10&#160;years of diagnosis, and 13.5% and 4.3%, respectively, within 20&#160;years of diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment with topical medication, laser surgery, and incisional surgery to lower IOP has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of glaucomatous progression (see Clinical Trials&#160;4-1 through 4-4 at the end of this chapter). For patients with decreased visual function, a referral to a vision rehabilitation specialist should be considered. These specialists can help improve visual function by optimizing lighting, enhancing contrast, reducing glare, and providing adaptations to enhance activities of daily living. Orientation and mobility specialists can be consulted and vision substitution strategies (eg, talking books, watches) utilized to improve daily function and quality of life for these patients.

			<p class="h1">Open-Angle Glaucoma Without Elevated IOP (Normal-Tension Glaucoma, Low-Tension Glaucoma)</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Controversy remains as to whether normal-&#173;tension glaucoma (NTG) represents a distinct disease entity or whether it is simply POAG developing with IOP within the statistically normal range. Glaucoma can develop at any level of IOP within the range observed in the general population. Thus, IOP is a continuous risk factor for glaucoma, and any cutoff between “normal” and “abnormal” IOP is arbitrary. Accordingly, many authorities believe the terms <span class="italic">normal-&#173;tension glaucoma</span> and <span class="italic">low-&#173;tension glaucoma </span>should be abandoned.</p>
			<p class="h2">Risk Factors and Clinical Features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As previously emphasized, glaucoma is a multifactorial disease process for which elevated IOP is just one of several risk factors. Studies suggest that among persons of Japanese descent, the proportion of OAG with IOPs in the average range is particularly high. Other risk factors may play a greater role in NTG than in POAG with higher IOPs (ie, high-&#173;tension POAG). Many authorities hypothesize that local vascular factors may have a significant role in the development of NTG. Some studies suggest that patients with NTG have a higher prevalence of vasospastic disorders (eg, migraine and Raynaud phenomenon), is&#173;chemic vascular disease, autoimmune disease, sleep apnea, systemic hypotension, and coagulopathies than patients with high-&#173;tension POAG. However, these findings have not been consistent. Vascular autoregulatory defects have also been described in eyes with NTG.</p>
			<p class="body-text">NTG is characteristically bilateral but often asymmetric. In glaucomatous eyes with IOPs within the statistically normal range but asymmetric, worse damage typically occurs in the eye with the higher IOP. Optic disc hemorrhage (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-1</span>) may be more common among patients with NTG than with high-&#173;tension POAG. Some authorities classify NTG into 2&#160;groups based on optic nerve appearance:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">a <span class="italic">senile sclerotic group</span> with shallow, pale sloping of the neuroretinal rim that is primarily seen in older patients with vascular disease</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-11">a <span class="italic">focal ischemic group</span> with deep, focal notching of the neuroretinal rim</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The visual field defects in NTG tend to be more focal, deeper, and closer to fixation, especially with early disease, compared with those commonly seen with high-&#173;tension POAG. Also, a dense paracentral scotoma encroaching near fixation (ie, “shotgun” appearance) is not an unusual initial finding on the visual field tests of NTG patients. However, these differences may be due to detection bias. Further, differences in optic nerve appearance and visual field defects between patients with NTG and those with high-&#173;tension POAG are not uniformly confirmed in studies. Therefore, for any individual patient, there is no characteristic abnormality of the optic nerve or visual field that distinguishes NTG from high-&#173;tension POAG.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Differential Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Normal-&#173;tension glaucoma can be mimicked by many conditions, as summarized in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;4-2</span>. It is essential to distinguish NTG and other glaucomas from nonglaucomatous etiologies (eg, optic nerve drusen, ischemic optic neuropathy), because appropriate therapy may vary greatly. Visual field defects in several of these conditions may appear similar to those seen with NTG and can even be progressive.</p>
			<p class="body-text">POAG may be misdiagnosed as NTG because of diurnal variations of IOP. Diurnal IOP measurement may help determine target IOPs by identifying peak IOPs and IOP fluctuation, but it does not capture nocturnal patterns of IOP. Also, elevated IOP can be obscured in patients taking systemic medication, particularly systemic <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers. In addition, some patients with apparent NTG may have artifactually low tonometry readings because of reduced scleral rigidity or thin CCT. Similarly, decreased corneal thickness in patients who have undergone refractive surgery may result in an erroneous diagnosis of NTG because of an underestimation of true IOP. Patients with myopia may have anomalous optic nerve heads or myopia-&#173;related visual field defects that often make it difficult to diagnose glaucoma or monitor for glaucomatous progression.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Diagnostic Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician must carefully review the patient’s medical history for conditions that cause an optic nerve appearance and/or visual field defects similar to those seen in NTG: these include significant systemic hemorrhage associated with low blood pressure, myocardial infarction, or shock. Visual field defects consistent with glaucoma have been noted after a decrease in blood pressure following a hypotensive crisis; however, these defects do not progress once the underlying condition is stable. It is also important to inquire about previous corticosteroid use associated with prior glaucomatous damage that has stabilized. Further, obtaining a detailed medical history is important to assess for conditions associated with NTG, such as migraine headaches, autoimmune disease, sleep apnea, and chronic or nocturnal low blood pressure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Before confirming a diagnosis of NTG, the clinician should measure the patient’s IOP by applanation tonometry at various times of the day (ie, diurnal curve), as well as on different days. Repeated testing may detect elevated IOP in many of these eyes. Gonioscopy should be performed to rule out other etiologies, such as angle closure, trauma (ie, angle recession), prior inflammation, or pigment dispersion. Careful stereoscopic optic nerve evaluation is essential to rule out other congenital or acquired optic nerve anomalies, such as a coloboma, drusen, or physiologic cupping due to a large scleral canal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the setting of atypical findings—for example, unilateral disease, decreased central vision, dyschromatopsia, young age, presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect, neuroretinal rim pallor, or visual field loss inconsistent with optic nerve appearance—additional medical and neurologic evaluation should be considered. This may include evaluation for anemia, carotid artery insufficiency, syphilis, certain vitamin deficiencies, temporal arteritis, or other causes of systemic vasculitis. Auscultation and palpation of the carotid arteries should be performed; noninvasive tests of carotid circulation (eg, carotid Doppler ultrasonography) may be helpful. In cases of optic nerve pallor or visual field loss suggestive of a neurologic defect, evaluation of the optic nerve and chiasm with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging may be warranted. See also BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span></p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Prognosis and Therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the Collaborative Normal-&#173;Tension Glaucoma Study (CNTGS), IOP lowering by at least 30% reduced the 5-year risk of visual field progression from 35% to 12%, supporting the role of IOP in NTG. It should be noted that the protective effect of IOP reduction was evident only after adjusting for the effect of cataracts, which were more frequent in the treated group. Based on the findings of the CNTGS, treatment of NTG is generally recommended unless the optic neuropathy is determined to be stable. Interestingly, 65% of patients in this study did not progress over the study duration despite no treatment, whereas 12% of patients progressed despite a 30% reduction of IOP. Factors in addition to IOP are likely operative in patients with this disease. The rate of visual field progression was highly variable yet slow in most individuals with visual field progression. In addition, this study showed a lower treatment benefit among patients with a baseline history of a disc hemorrhage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The initial goal of therapy is often to achieve a near 30% IOP reduction from a carefully determined baseline IOP. Once this is established, routine evaluations with appropriate individualized adjustments for target pressure are recommended. These adjustments should take into account relevant factors, including baseline severity of optic nerve damage and visual field loss, potential risks of therapy, comorbid conditions, and life expectancy of the patient. Target pressure should be reassessed and adjusted as needed during follow-&#173;up visits in order to maintain visual function.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To achieve the target IOP, medications, laser trabeculoplasty, or filtering surgery may be indicated. Topical medical therapy is the most common initial approach in the management of NTG. In addition to lowering IOP, some glaucoma medications may have neuroprotective properties or may improve ocular perfusion. These potential benefits have not been proven clinically, and the role of neuroprotective agents remains under investigation. Some glaucoma specialists are wary of treating NTG with topical <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker medications because of their association with low ocular perfusion pressure (see the subsection “Lower ocular perfusion pressure”). The Low-&#173;Pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study (LoGTS) showed a high rate of glaucomatous progression in patients treated with timolol. However, there was a significant loss of follow-&#173;up in this study; the results must be interpreted with caution. In the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT; see Clinical Trial&#160;4-3), IOP-&#173;lowering with the combination of betaxolol and argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) was minimal in eyes with baseline IOPs of 15&#160;mm&#160;Hg or lower. This suggests that patients with a lower baseline IOP who are progressing may need incisional surgery or medications other than <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers to stabilize their disease. See Chapter&#160;8 for further discussion of indications for surgery. The use of an adjunct antifibrotic agent (eg, mitomycin&#160;C or 5-fluorouracil) during filtering surgery may improve the likelihood that the target IOP will be reached.</p>

			<p class="h1">The Glaucoma Suspect</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A glaucoma suspect is defined as an individual who has either (1)&#160;a suspicious optic nerve or nerve fiber layer appearance in the absence of a visual field defect; or (2)&#160;a visual field defect suggestive of glaucoma in the absence of a corresponding glaucomatous optic nerve abnormality. Patients with such findings are typically monitored for the development of glaucoma with periodic evaluation of the optic nerve, retinal nerve fiber layer, and visual field. In patients with an absence of visual field defects on standard perimetry (see Chapter&#160;3), the use of frequency-&#173;doubling technology and pattern electroretinogram may be useful for detecting early loss of visual function. If signs of optic nerve damage are present, the diagnosis of early POAG and initiation of treatment should be considered. In uncertain cases, however, close monitoring of the patient without treatment is reasonable in order to better establish a diagnosis (ie, confirm initial findings or detect progressive changes) before initiation of therapy. Glaucoma suspects who have elevated IOP and structural or functional findings that are not firmly diagnostic of glaucoma may be difficult to classify into one diagnostic category.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-13">Ocular Hypertension</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some authors consider patients with ocular hypertension to be glaucoma suspects. In this book, <span class="italic">ocular hypertension</span> is defined as a condition in which IOP is elevated above an arbitrary cutoff value, typically 21&#160;mm&#160;Hg, in the absence of optic nerve, retinal nerve fiber layer, or visual field abnormalities. Estimates of the prevalence of ocular hypertension in the United States vary considerably and may be as high as 8&#160;times that of diagnosed POAG. Studies of individuals with elevated IOP for various lengths of time suggest that a higher baseline IOP is associated with a greater risk of developing glaucoma. However, for most persons with elevated IOP, the risk of developing glaucoma is low.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Distinguishing between ocular hypertension and early POAG is often difficult. The ophthalmologist must look carefully for signs of early damage to the optic nerve, such as focal notching, asymmetry of cupping, optic disc hemorrhage, nerve fiber layer defects, or subtle visual field defects.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There is no clear consensus about whether elevated IOP should be treated in the absence of signs of early damage. Some clinicians, after assessing all risk factors, select and treat those individuals thought to be at greatest risk of developing glaucoma. In the OHTS, patients 40–80&#160;years of age with IOP between 24 and 32&#160;mm&#160;Hg were randomized to either observation or treatment with topical ocular hypotensive medications (see Clinical Trial&#160;4-2 at the end of this chapter). During a 5-year period, 4.4% of participants in the treatment group versus 9.5% of participants in the observation group progressed to glaucoma, based on optic nerve and visual field changes. Thus, topical medications reduce the risk of progression to glaucoma in patients with ocular hypertension. It should be noted, however, that most untreated participants did not progress over a 5-year period. In the OHTS, the risk of developing glaucoma was increased by 10% for every mm&#160;Hg increase in IOP from the baseline IOP; the risk was increased by 32% for each 0.1 increment in vertical cup–disc ratio.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Results from the OHTS suggest that increased age, higher IOP, thinner corneas, larger cup–disc ratio at baseline, and higher pattern standard deviation on standard automated perimetry are important risk factors for the development of POAG. Data from the OHTS and the European Glaucoma Prevention Study were combined to create a risk calculation model to predict the 5-year risk of conversion from ocular hypertension to glaucoma based on these risk factors. The increased risk of glaucoma progression attributed to thinner corneas in the OHTS, however, was not fully explained by the estimated artifactual error in measured IOP. This may be due to thinner corneas being a biomarker for other susceptibility factors. The increased risk of glaucoma progression in black participants (on univariate but not multivariate analyses) may be attributed to their thinner corneas and greater cup–disc ratios. Interestingly, a positive family history of glaucoma was not identified as a significant risk factor in this study, possibly because of inadequate assessment from self-&#173;reporting. Clinicians should consider family history when evaluating a patient’s risk of glaucoma. Other potential risk factors, such as myopia, diabetes mellitus, migraine, and high or low blood pressure, were not confirmed in the OHTS as significant risk factors for glaucomatous progression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Initial reports from the OHTS clearly demonstrate that lowering IOP in individuals with ocular hypertension reduces the risk of progression to glaucoma. It is important to recognize, however, that the incremental structural or functional change that constituted a progression endpoint in the OHTS would likely not manifest as symptomatic vision loss. Therefore, the question remains whether delaying treatment is associated with poorer outcomes compared with early initiation of IOP-&#173;lowering therapy. The results from the OHTS suggest that clinicians may safely consider delaying the treatment of ocular hypertension, particularly among patients with a lower risk of conversion to glaucoma (see Clinical Trial&#160;4-2 at the end of this chapter).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The decision of whether to treat a patient with ocular hypertension should be based on results from the OHTS, findings from the clinical examination, and discussions with the patient. The clinician and patient should consider whether the risk factors for developing glaucoma outweigh the inconvenience, cost, and potential side effects of therapy for the patient. Additional factors to consider include the patient’s age, potential life span, adherence to therapy and follow-&#173;up visits, and the ability to monitor disease progression with accurate assessments of the optic nerve (eg, anomalous optic nerves may be difficult to monitor) and reliable visual field tests.</p>

			<p class="h1">Secondary Open-Angle Glaucoma</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (exfoliation syndrome)</span> is characterized by the deposition of a distinctive fibrillar extracellular material in the anterior segment of the eye. Histologically, this material has been found in and on the lens epithelium and capsule, pupillary margin, ciliary epithelium, iris pigment epithelium, iris stroma, iris blood vessels, and subconjunctival tissue. The material has also been identified in other parts of the body. Mutations in a single gene, <span class="italic">LOXL1,</span> seem to be present in nearly all cases of pseudoexfoliation syndrome and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma; however, these disease-&#173;associated mutations are also common in populations without pseudoexfoliation syndrome or glaucoma, suggesting a multifactorial etiology for this disease. The exact mechanism by which <span class="italic">LOXL1</span> mutations are related to pseudoexfoliation syndrome is unclear, but it likely involves the reduced or abnormal synthesis of elastin fibers. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome may be a systemic disease with material deposits found in various organs, including the skin, lung, heart, and liver.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pseudoexfoliation syndrome can present unilaterally or bilaterally and with varying degrees of asymmetry. Often, this disorder presents unilaterally, and the uninvolved eye manifests signs of the disease at a later time. This syndrome is strongly age related: it is rarely seen in persons younger than 50&#160;years and occurs most commonly in individuals older than 70&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The classic characteristic of pseudoexfoliation syndrome is the deposition of fibrillar deposits in a “bull’s-eye” pattern on the anterior lens capsule, which is best seen after pupillary dilation. This pattern is presumably caused by iris movement that scrapes the pseudoexfoliative material from the lens, causing a clear intermediate area in between a central and peripheral zone of the material (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-2</span>). Clinically, this fibrillar extracellular material can be seen on the pupillary margin, zonular fibers of the lens, ciliary processes, inferior anterior chamber angle, corneal endothelium, and the anterior hyaloid (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;4-3, 4-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Individuals with pseudoexfoliation syndrome may also have peripupillary atrophy with transillumination defects. These patients may have fine pigment deposits on the iris or in a vertical linear pattern on the cornea (Krukenberg spindles); the deposits are also commonly seen in persons with pigmentary dispersion syndrome. The pupil often dilates poorly, likely because of infiltration of fibrillar material into the iris stroma. Phacodonesis and iridodonesis can be seen and are due to the weak zonular fibers. Thus, great care must be taken during cataract surgery to reduce the risk of zonular dehiscence, vitreous loss, lens dislocation, and other complications intraoperatively and postoperatively (see also BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract</span>). Iris angiography has shown abnormalities of the iris vessels with leakage of fluorescein.</p>
			<p class="body-text">On gonioscopy, the trabecular meshwork is typically heavily pigmented, sometimes in a variegated fashion. Pigment deposition anterior to the Schwalbe line is commonly seen and referred to as the <span class="italic">Sampaolesi line</span> (see Fig&#160;4-4). The zonular fibers in patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome are often weak and may cause an anterior movement of the lens–iris interface, resulting in narrow angles.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The IOP elevation associated with pseudoexfoliation syndrome is likely due to deposits of fibrillar material in the trabecular meshwork that impede the outflow of aqueous through the trabecular meshwork or uveoscleral pathways. In addition, since elastin is an important component of the lamina cribrosa, pseudoexfoliation syndrome may increase the susceptibility of the optic nerve to injury. This increased susceptibility may, in turn, contribute to the increased risk of development and progression of glaucoma in these patients, as was found in the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (see Clinical Trial&#160;4-3 at the end of this chapter).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Individuals with pseudoexfoliation syndrome with elevated IOP resulting in optic nerve damage or visual field loss are described as having <span class="italic">pseudoexfoliation glaucoma.</span> Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is associated with OAG in all populations, but the prevalence varies considerably. In Scandinavian countries, pseudoexfoliation syndrome accounts for more than 50% of cases of OAG. The risk of progression to glaucoma also varies widely and can be as high as 40% of patients over a 10-year period. Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma differs from POAG in that it often presents unilaterally and with greater pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork. In addition, the IOP is often higher and there are greater diurnal fluctuations in IOP in pseudoexfoliation glaucoma than in POAG. The overall prognosis for glaucoma is worse for patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma than for those with POAG. Laser trabeculoplasty can be very effective, but the duration of the response may be shorter in pseudoexfoliation glaucoma than in POAG. Lens extraction does not alleviate the condition.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Pigment Dispersion Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In pigment dispersion syndrome, the zonular fibers rub the posterior iris pigment epithelium, resulting in the release of pigment granules throughout the eye. Posterior bowing of the iris with “reverse pupillary block” configuration is noted in many eyes with pigment dispersion syndrome. This concave iris configuration results in greater contact with the zonular fibers, causing increased release of pigment granules.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pigment dispersion syndrome classically presents with pigment deposits on the corneal endothelium, trabecular meshwork, and lens periphery, as well as with midperipheral iris transillumination defects in a spokelike pattern. The pigment deposits on the corneal endothelium are typically in a vertical spindle pattern, referred to as <span class="italic">Krukenberg spindle</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-5</span>), and are caused by aqueous convection currents and subsequent phagocytosis of pigment by the corneal endothelium. The presence of a Krukenberg spindle is not necessary for a diagnosis of pigment dispersion syndrome, however, and this sign may be present in other diseases, such as pseudoexfoliation syndrome. The midperipheral iris transillumination defects are a result of contact between the zonular fibers and the posterior iris pigment epithelium (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-6</span>). On gonioscopy, the trabecular meshwork commonly appears as homogeneous and densely pigmented, with speckled pigment at or anterior to the Schwalbe line (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-7</span>), often forming a Sampaolesi line. When the eye is dilated, pigment deposits may be seen on the zonular fibers, on the anterior hyaloid, and in the equatorial region of the lens capsule (Zentmayer ring or Scheie stripe, <br /><span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">With increasing age, the signs of pigment dispersion may decrease as a result of normal growth of the lens, inducing a physiologic pupillary block and anterior movement of the iris. Loss of accommodation may also occur. As pigment dispersion is reduced, the deposited pigment may fade from the corneal endothelium, trabecular meshwork, or anterior surface of the iris.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Approximately 15% of individuals with pigment dispersion syndrome progress to glaucoma or elevated IOP requiring treatment. Pigmentary glaucoma is 3&#160;times more common in men than in women, particularly men who are young or middle-&#173;aged (20–50&#160;years) and myopic. The presumed mechanism of elevated IOP is obstruction of the trabecular meshwork by pigment granules. <span class="italic">Pigmentary glaucoma</span> is characterized by wide fluctuations in IOP, which can exceed 50&#160;mm&#160;Hg in untreated eyes. Affected patients may have extreme elevations in IOP following exercise or pupillary dilation because of an excessive liberation of pigment. Symptoms associated with such elevated IOPs may include halos, intermittent blurry vision, and ocular pain.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Laser peripheral iridotomy has been proposed as a means of minimizing posterior bowing of the iris (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-9</span>). However, its effectiveness in treating pigmentary glaucoma has not been established. Medical treatment is often successful in reducing elevated IOP. Patients respond reasonably well to laser trabeculoplasty, although the effect may be short-lived. Because the heavy trabecular meshwork pigmentation allows increased absorption of laser energy, lower-&#173;energy settings are recommended during laser trabeculoplasty to avoid an acute rise in IOP after treatment. Filtering surgery is usually successful; however, extra care is warranted in young myopic male patients, who are at increased risk for hypotony maculopathy.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Lens-Induced Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens can play a causative role in the development of open-&#173;angle and angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. Lens-&#173;induced OAGs are divided into 3&#160;clinical entities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">phacolytic glaucoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">lens particle glaucoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-11">phacoantigenic glaucoma</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lens-induced angle-&#173;closure glaucomas include phacomorphic glaucoma and ectopia lentis and are discussed in Chapter&#160;5. See also BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> and Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Phacolytic glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phacolytic glaucoma is an inflammatory glaucoma caused by the leakage of high-molecular-&#173;weight lens protein through the capsule of a mature or hypermature cataract (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-10</span>) that subsequently obstructs the trabecular meshwork. As the lens ages, its protein composition becomes altered, with an increased concentration of high-molecular-&#173;weight lens protein. In a mature or hypermature cataract, these proteins are released through microscopic openings in the lens capsule. Elevated IOP occurs as a result of obstruction of the trabecular meshwork by these high-molecular-&#173;weight proteins, lens-&#173;laden macrophages, and other inflammatory debris.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Individuals with phacolytic glaucoma are usually older patients with a history of poor vision. They have a sudden onset of pain, conjunctival hyperemia, and worsening vision. Examination reveals markedly elevated IOP, microcystic corneal edema, prominent cell and flare reaction without keratic precipitates (KP), an open anterior chamber angle, and a mature or hypermature cataract (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-11</span>). The lack of KPs helps distinguish phacolytic glaucoma from phacoantigenic glaucoma. Cellular debris may be seen layered in the anterior chamber angle, and a pseudohypopyon may be present. Large white particles (clumps of lens protein) may also be seen in the anterior chamber. The mature or hypermature (morgagnian) cataract may have wrinkling of the anterior lens capsule, which represents loss of volume and the release of lens material (see Fig&#160;4-10). Ocular hypotensive medications to reduce the IOP should be used immediately; however, definitive therapy requires cataract extraction.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Lens particle glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In lens particle glaucoma, retention of lens material in the eye after cataract extraction, capsulotomy, or ocular trauma results in obstruction of the trabecular meshwork. The severity of IOP elevation depends on the quantity of lens material released, the degree of inflammation, the ability of the trabecular meshwork to clear the lens material, and the functional status of the ciliary body, which is often altered following surgery or trauma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lens particle glaucoma usually occurs within weeks of the initial surgery or trauma, but it may occur months or years later. Clinical findings include cortical material in the anterior chamber, elevated IOP, moderate anterior chamber reaction, microcystic corneal edema, and, with time, posterior synechiae and peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Medical therapy should be initiated to reduce the IOP while the residual lens material resorbs. Appropriate therapy includes medications to decrease aqueous formation, mydriatics to inhibit posterior synechiae formation, and topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. If the IOP cannot be controlled, surgical removal of the lens material is necessary.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Phacoantigenic glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phacoantigenic glaucoma (previously known as <span class="italic">phacoanaphylaxis</span>) is a rare entity in which patients become sensitized to their own lens protein following surgery or penetrating trauma, resulting in a granulomatous inflammation. The clinical picture is quite varied, but most patients present with a moderate anterior chamber reaction with KPs on both the corneal endothelium and the anterior lens surface. In addition, a low-grade vitritis, posterior synechiae and PAS, and residual lens material in the anterior chamber may be present. Glaucomatous optic neuropathy may occur, but it is not common in eyes with phacoantigenic glaucoma. Initiation of topical corticosteroids and aqueous suppressants are recommended to reduce the inflammation and IOP. If medical treatment is unsuccessful, residual lens material should be removed.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Intraocular Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A variety of tumors can cause unilateral chronic glaucoma. Many of the tumors described in this section are also discussed in BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors.</span> Glaucoma can result from several different mechanisms, depending on the size, type, and location of the tumor:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">direct tumor invasion of the anterior chamber angle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">angle closure by rotation of the ciliary body or by anterior displacement of the lens–iris interface (see Chapter&#160;5)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">intraocular hemorrhage</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">neovascularization of the angle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">deposition of tumor cells, inflammatory cells, and cellular debris within the trabecular meshwork</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Choroidal and retinal tumors typically cause a secondary angle-&#173;closure glaucoma by the anterior displacement of the lens–iris diaphragm, resulting in closure of the anterior chamber angle. Posterior synechiae may develop as a result of inflammation of necrotic tumors; they exacerbate angle closure through a pupillary block mechanism. Choroidal melanomas, medulloepitheliomas, and retinoblastomas may also cause neovascularization of the angle, which can result in angle closure. Neovascularization of the angle may also occur after radiation therapy for intraocular tumors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common cause of glaucoma associated with primary or metastatic tumors of the ciliary body is direct invasion of the anterior chamber angle. This glaucoma can be exacerbated by anterior segment hemorrhage and inflammation, which further obstruct aqueous outflow. Necrotic tumor and tumor-&#173;laden macrophages may cause obstruction of the trabecular meshwork and result in a secondary OAG. Tumors causing a secondary glaucoma in adults include uveal melanoma and melanocytoma (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;4-12, 4-13</span>), metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, and leukemia. In children, tumors associated with glaucoma include retinoblastoma, juvenile xanthogranuloma, and medulloepithelioma.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Ocular Inflammation and Secondary Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Inflammatory, or uveitic, glaucoma is a secondary glaucoma that often combines components of open-&#173;angle and angle-&#173;closure disease. In individuals with uveitis, elevated IOP may be caused by a variety of mechanisms; appropriate therapy depends on the etiology:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-15">edema of the trabecular meshwork</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">endothelial cell dysfunction of the trabecular meshwork</li>

				<li class="bullet-list-mid">PAS blocking outflow</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-16">prostaglandin-&#173;mediated breakdown of the blood–aqueous barrier</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most cases of anterior uveitis are idiopathic, but uveitides commonly associated with open-&#173;angle inflammatory glaucoma include Fuchs heterochromic uveitis (Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis), herpes zoster iridocyclitis, herpes simplex keratouveitis, toxoplasmosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and pars planitis. See also BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">The presence of KPs suggests anterior uveitis as the cause of IOP elevation. Gonioscopic evaluation may reveal subtle trabecular meshwork precipitates. Occasionally, PAS or posterior synechiae with iris bombé may develop, resulting in angle closure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The treatment of inflammatory glaucoma is complicated by the fact that corticosteroid therapy may increase IOP, likely by increasing outflow resistance, but possibly by improving aqueous production as well. Miotic agents should be avoided in patients with anterior uveitis, because they may exacerbate the inflammation and cause formation of posterior synechiae. Prostaglandin analogues may exacerbate inflammation in some eyes with uveitis and herpetic keratitis; however, some patients may benefit from their IOP-&#173;lowering effects without increased inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some uveitis patients may have low IOP. The etiology is unclear but may be related to a prostaglandin-&#173;mediated increase in uveoscleral outflow. Hyposecretion of aqueous humor (particularly if ciliary body detachment is present) has often been assumed to be the etiology for low IOP but has not been confirmed, as aqueous flow currently cannot be measured in the presence of uveitis.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Glaucomatocyclitic crisis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">First described by Posner and Schlossman in 1948, glaucomatocyclitic crisis (also known as <span class="italic">Posner-&#173;Schlossman syndrome</span>) is an uncommon form of open-&#173;angle inflammatory glaucoma characterized by acute, unilateral episodes of markedly elevated IOP accompanied by a low-grade anterior chamber inflammation. This condition most frequently affects middle-&#173;aged persons, who usually present with unilateral blurred vision and mild ocular pain. The anterior uveitis is mild, with few KPs, which are small, discrete, and round and which usually resolve spontaneously within a few weeks. On gonioscopy, KPs may be seen on the trabecular meshwork, suggesting a “trabeculitis.” The elevated IOP may range between 40 and 50&#160;mm&#160;Hg, and corneal edema may be present. In between episodes, the IOP usually returns to normal, but with increasing numbers of episodes, a chronic secondary glaucoma may develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The etiology of glaucomatocyclitic crisis remains unknown, but theories include various infections (eg, herpes simplex virus) and autoimmune disease. Recurrent attacks of acute angle-&#173;closure glaucoma have been mistaken for this condition. In some cases in which glaucomatocyclitic crisis was initially diagnosed, cytomegalovirus DNA was subsequently detected in the aqueous humor by polymerase chain reaction (see BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for discussion of cytomegalovirus). Distinguishing glaucomatocyclitic crisis from cytomegalovirus is important, because specific antiviral therapy for cytomegalovirus is available.</p>
			<p class="body-text">During a glaucomatocyclitic crisis, treatment should be initiated to control IOP and reduce inflammation. Topical (eg, <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers) and often oral (eg, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors) ocular hypotensive medications are used to reduce IOP. Prostaglandin analogues may exacerbate the condition. Topical corticosteroids and topical and/or oral nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory medications (eg, indomethacin) may be of benefit. There is no evidence that long-term suppressive therapy with topical nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory agents or corticosteroids is effective in preventing attacks.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Fuchs heterochromic uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fuchs heterochromic uveitis (also called <span class="italic">Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis</span>) is a relatively rare, insidious, and chronic form of uveitis that is typically unilateral. There is no race or sex predilection, and it often manifests in young to middle adulthood. It is characterized by iris heterochromia, low-grade anterior chamber inflammation, posterior subcapsular cataracts, and secondary OAG. The heterochromia is due to loss of iris pigment in the affected eye, which is usually hypochromic in dark eyes and hyperchromic in light eyes. The low-grade inflammation is often accompanied by small, stellate, pancorneal KPs. Despite the low-grade inflammation, these patients are classically asymptomatic and present with a nonhyperemic eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Secondary OAG occurs in approximately 15% of patients with this disease. On gonioscopy, multiple fine vessels may be viewed crossing the trabecular meshwork (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-14</span>). These vessels are usually not accompanied by a fibrous membrane and typically do not result in PAS formation and secondary angle closure, although in rare cases the neovas&#173;cularization may be progressive. The vessels are fragile and may cause an anterior chamber hemorrhage, either spontaneously or with trauma. A classic finding is anterior chamber hemorrhage after a paracentesis during ocular surgery (Amsler sign).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of Fuchs heterochromic uveitis is directed at controlling the IOP with topical ocular hypotensive medications. IOP control may be difficult, and the IOP does not necessarily correspond with the degree of inflammation. Corticosteroids are generally not effective in treating the low-grade chronic inflammation, and their use could elevate the IOP. Recent studies suggest that rubella virus infection may be the underlying etiology of this condition.</p>

			<p class="h2">Elevated Episcleral Venous Pressure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Episcleral venous pressure (EVP) is an important factor in the determination of IOP. Normal EVP ranges between 6 and 9&#160;mm&#160;Hg, depending on the measurement technique used. Elevated EVP may occur because of a variety of clinical entities that either result in obstruction of venous outflow or involve arteriovenous malformations (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;4-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients may note a chronic red eye without ocular discomfort, itching, or discharge. Occasionally, a distant history of a significant head trauma may suggest the cause of a carotid-&#173;cavernous sinus (high-flow) or dural (low-flow) fistula. However, most cases are idiopathic, and some may be familial. Clinically, patients with elevated EVP present with tortuous, dilated episcleral veins (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-15</span>). These vascular abnormalities may be unilateral or bilateral. Gonioscopy often reveals blood in the Schlemm canal (see Chapter&#160;3, Fig&#160;3-5). In rare instances, signs of ocular ischemia or venous stasis may be present. Sudden, severe carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas may be accompanied by proptosis and other orbital or neurologic signs. Patients should undergo magnetic resonance imaging or angiography to rule out a vascular malformation. If these tests fail to show an abnormality and the clinical suspicion is high, traditional angiography with neuroradiologic intervention (eg, coiling of fistula) should be considered when the benefits to the patient outweigh the risks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Topical ocular hypotensive medications, particularly those that reduce aqueous production, may be effective in some patients. Due to the etiology of the condition, laser trabeculoplasty is likely not effective. Glaucoma filtering surgery may be indicated. However, given the risk of a ciliochoroidal effusion or suprachoroidal hemorrhage, prophylactic sclerotomies or scleral windows may be necessary.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Trauma and Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nonpenetrating, or blunt, trauma to the eye causes a variety of anterior segment conditions that may lead to secondary glaucoma:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-15">inflammation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">hyphema</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">angle recession</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-16">lens subluxation (see Chapter&#160;5, ectopia lentis)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">These findings, particularly when in combination, often lead to elevated IOP initially after trauma. This elevation tends to be brief but may be protracted and result in glaucomatous optic nerve damage.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Siderosis</span> or <span class="italic">chalcosis</span> from a retained intraocular metallic foreign body in penetrating or perforating injuries may lead to chronic OAG. Chemical injuries, particularly those involving alkali, may cause acute secondary glaucoma as a result of inflammation, shrinkage of scleral collagen, release of chemical mediators such as prostaglandins, direct damage to the anterior chamber angle, or compromised anterior uveal circulation. Recurrent inflammation or damage to the trabecular meshwork may progress to glaucoma over months or years after a chemical injury.</p>
			<p class="h3">Traumatic hyphema</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The risk of elevated IOP after a traumatic hyphema is increased with recurrent hemorrhage, or rebleeding. The average reported frequency of rebleeding after an initial hyphema is 5%–10%, but it varies significantly with different study populations. Rebleeding usually occurs within 3–7&#160;days of the initial hyphema and may be related to normal clot retraction and lysis. In general, the larger the hyphema, the higher the incidence of increased IOP, although small hemorrhages may also be associated with marked elevation of IOP, particularly when the angle is already compromised. Increased IOP occurs as a result of obstruction of the trabecular meshwork with red blood cells (RBCs), inflammatory cells, debris, and fibrin, as well as from direct injury to the trabecular meshwork from the blunt trauma. Careful gonioscopic examination in individuals with blunt trauma may reveal a subtle hyphema. In addition to glaucomatous damage, prolonged IOP elevation in an eye with a hyphema increases the risk of corneal blood staining (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-16</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Individuals with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies have an increased risk of elevated IOP following hyphema and are more susceptible to the development of optic neuropathy. Normal RBCs pass through the trabecular meshwork without difficulty. However, in the sickle cell hemoglobinopathies (including sickle cell trait), the low pH of the aqueous humor causes the RBCs to sickle and become rigid. These more rigid cells become trapped in the trabecular meshwork, and even small amounts of sickle-&#173;shaped RBCs may cause marked elevations in IOP. In addition, the optic nerves of patients with sickle cell disease are much more sensitive to elevated IOP and are prone to development of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and central retinal artery occlusion, as a result of compromised microvascular perfusion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, the patient with an uncomplicated hyphema should be managed conservatively, with an eye shield, limited activity, and head elevation. Topical and oral corticosteroids may reduce associated inflammation, although their effect on rebleeding is debatable. If significant ciliary spasm or photophobia occurs, cycloplegic agents may be helpful, but they have no proven benefit for prevention of rebleeding. Oral administration of aminocaproic acid has been shown to reduce rebleeding in some studies. However, this has not been confirmed in all studies, and systemic adverse effects, such as hypotension, syncope, abdominal pain, and nausea, can be significant. Also, discontinuation of aminocaproic acid may be associated with clot lysis and additional IOP elevation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of elevated IOP in patients with hyphema includes ocular hypotensive agents, particularly aqueous suppressants, and hyperosmotic agents. It has been suggested that patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies avoid carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, because these agents may increase the sickling tendency in the anterior chamber by further lowering the pH; however, this relationship has not been firmly established. Physicians should be aware that the use of systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and hyperosmotic agents may induce a sickle crisis in susceptible individuals who are significantly dehydrated. Adrenergic agonists with significant <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-agonist effects (apraclonidine, dipivefrin, epinephrine) should also be avoided in patients with sickle cell disease, because of the potential for anterior segment vasoconstriction with their use. Parasympathomimetic agents should be avoided in all patients with traumatic hyphema.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For patients with sickle cell disease, clinicians should have a lower threshold for surgical intervention, given these patients’ increased risk of optic neuropathy from elevated IOP. In young children, vision obstruction by the hyphema or corneal blood staining may justify early surgical intervention to reduce the risk of amblyopia. If surgery for elevated IOP becomes necessary, an anterior chamber irrigation is commonly performed first. If a total hyphema is present, pupillary block may occur, and an iridectomy is helpful at the time of the washout. If the IOP remains uncontrolled, filtering surgery may be required. Some surgeons prefer to perform glaucoma filtering surgery with the anterior chamber washout in order to obtain immediate control of IOP, relieve any pupillary block, and reduce the risk of elevated IOP in the future from damage to the trabecular meshwork.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Hemolytic and ghost cell glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hemolytic glaucoma, ghost cell glaucoma, or both may develop after a vitreous hemorrhage. In <span class="italic">hemolytic glaucoma,</span> hemoglobin-&#173;laden macrophages block the trabecular meshwork. Red-&#173;tinged cells are seen floating in the anterior chamber, and the trabecular meshwork may appear reddish brown. In <span class="italic">ghost cell glaucoma,</span> degenerated RBCs (ghost cells) obstruct the trabecular meshwork.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ghost cells are small, khaki-&#173;colored RBCs that have lost their intracellular hemoglobin (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-17</span>). They are less pliable than normal RBCs; thus, they obstruct the trabecular meshwork and cause elevated IOP. RBCs degenerate within 1–3&#160;months after a vitreous hemorrhage. They gain access to the anterior chamber through a disrupted hyaloid face, which can occur from previous surgery (pars plana vitrectomy, cataract extraction, or capsulotomy) or trauma or spontaneously.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with ghost cell glaucoma typically present with elevated IOP and a history of or current vitreous hemorrhage from trauma, surgery, or preexisting retinal disease. The IOP may be markedly elevated, with accompanying corneal edema. The anterior chamber may contain degenerated RBCs. The cellular reaction is often out of proportion to the aqueous flare, and the conjunctiva tends not to be inflamed unless the IOP is markedly elevated. On gonioscopy, the angle appears normal except for possible layering of ghost cells in the inferior angle. A long-&#173;standing vitreous hemorrhage may be present, with characteristic khaki coloration and clumps of extracellular pigmentation from degenerated hemoglobin.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hemolytic glaucoma and ghost cell glaucoma generally resolve once the hemorrhage has cleared. Medical therapy with aqueous suppressants is the preferred initial approach. If medical therapy fails to control the IOP, some patients may require anterior chamber irrigation, pars plana vitrectomy, and/or incisional glaucoma surgery. When a collection of RBCs or ghost cells is present in the vitreous, a pars plana vitrectomy is likely necessary for IOP control.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Traumatic, or angle-recession, glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Angle recession is a common finding after blunt trauma and involves a tear between the longitudinal and circular fibers of the ciliary body. It is important to note that angle recession is not necessarily associated with immediate IOP elevation and glaucoma; however, it is a sign of probable damage to the underlying trabecular meshwork. Traumatic glaucoma is chronic and usually unilateral and may occur immediately after the ocular trauma or months to years later. It resembles POAG in presentation and clinical course but can be distinguished by its classic gonioscopic findings (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;4-18, 4-19</span>):</p>

				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">widening of the ciliary body band</li>

				<li class="bullet-list-mid">irregular and dark pigmentation in the angle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-11">PAS at the border of the recession</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Traumatic glaucoma should be considered in a patient with unilateral IOP elevation. The patient’s history may reveal the contributing incident; often, however, this has been forgotten. Examination may reveal findings consistent with previous trauma, such as corneal scars, iris injury, abnormalities in the angle, focal anterior subcapsular cataracts, and phacodonesis. Comparing gonioscopic findings in the affected eye to those in the fellow eye may help the clinician identify areas of recession.</p>
			<p class="body-text">More extensive angle recession is associated with a greater reduction in outflow facility and an increased risk of glaucoma. However, even with substantial angle recession, this risk is not high. Although the risk of developing glaucoma decreases appreciably after several years, it is still present even 25&#160;years or more following injury. In a significant proportion (up to 50%) of fellow eyes, elevated IOP may occur, suggesting that eyes with traumatic glaucoma may be predisposed to OAG. Because it is not possible to predict which eyes will develop glaucoma, all eyes with angle recession and their fellow eyes should be monitored annually.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The treatment of traumatic glaucoma is often initiated with aqueous suppressants, prostaglandin analogues, and <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonists. Miotics may be useful, but paradoxical responses of increased IOP may occur. Laser trabeculoplasty has a limited role and a reduced likelihood of success. Incisional glaucoma surgery may be required in order to control the IOP in patients not responding to medical therapy.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-18">Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conventional surgical procedures such as cataract extraction, trabeculectomy, tube shunt implantation, and penetrating keratoplasty (see also the following subsection) may be followed by an increase in IOP. Similarly, laser surgery—including trabeculoplasty, iridotomy, and posterior capsulotomy—may be complicated by posttreatment IOP elevation. Although the IOP may rise as high as 50&#160;mm&#160;Hg or more, these elevations are usually transient, lasting from a few hours to a few days. The exact mechanism is not always known. However, the presence of inflammatory cells, RBCs, and debris; pigment release; mechanical deformation of the trabecular meshwork; and angle closure may all be implicated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, agents used as adjuncts to intraocular surgery or postoperative treatment (corticosteroids) may cause secondary IOP elevation. For example, the injection of viscoelastic substances such as sodium hyaluronate into the anterior chamber may result in a transient and possibly severe postoperative increase in IOP. Dispersive viscoelastic agents, especially in higher-molecular-&#173;weight forms, may be more likely to cause an increase in IOP than cohesive viscoelastics.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Postoperative IOP elevation, even over a short period, can cause considerable damage to the optic nerve in susceptible individuals. Eyes with preexisting glaucoma are particularly at risk of further damage; thus, it is extremely important to monitor IOP soon after conventional or laser surgery. If a substantial rise in IOP occurs, IOP-&#173;lowering therapy may be required, including the use of topical <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers, <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonists, or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. If postoperative inflammation is present, prostaglandin analogues may be deferred until the inflammation has resolved. Persistent IOP elevation may require filtering surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) can lead to a variety of secondary glaucomas, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-19">uveitis-glaucoma-&#173;hyphema syndrome</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">secondary pigmentary glaucoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-20">pseudophakic pupillary block (see Chapter&#160;5)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Uveitis-glaucoma-&#173;hyphema (UGH) syndrome</span> is a secondary inflammatory glaucoma classically caused by chafing of the iris by a malpositioned or rotated anterior chamber IOL. This condition can also occur following implantation of a posterior chamber or suture-&#173;fixated IOL. UGH syndrome often results in chronic inflammation, elevated IOP, and recurrent hyphemas, as well as cystoid macular edema and secondary iris neovascularization. Gonioscopy and ultrasound biomicroscopy may be helpful in revealing the IOL’s exact position in relation to the iris and ciliary body. Persistent or recurrent cases often require IOL repositioning or IOL exchange, which can be technically challenging because of possible synechiae and/or an open posterior capsule. This syndrome may be mimicked in patients with neovascularization of the internal lip of a corneoscleral wound, which may result in recurrent spontaneous hyphemas and elevated IOP. Argon laser ablation of the vessels may successfully resolve these cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Secondary glaucoma is a common complication after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and occurs with greater frequency in aphakic and pseudophakic patients and after a second graft. Wound distortion of the trabecular meshwork and progressive angle closure are the most common causes of glaucoma after PKP. Attempts to minimize these changes with different-&#173;sized donor grafts, peripheral iridectomies, and surgical repair of the iris sphincter have only been partially successful. Alternative procedures, such as lamellar stromal or endothelial grafts, may have a lower risk of elevated IOP. Long-term use of topical corticosteroids after PKP is another potential cause of elevated IOP and secondary glaucoma in these patients. See BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for further discussion of PKP.</p>
			<p class="reference-single ParaOverride-3">Jarstad JS, Hardwig PW. Intraocular hemorrhage from wound neovascularization years after anterior segment surgery (Swan syndrome). <span class="italic">Can&#160;J Ophthalmol.</span> 1987;22(5):271–275.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Schwartz Syndrome (Schwartz-Matsuo Syndrome)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Individuals with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment typically have lower IOP, presumably because of increased outflow of fluid through the exposed retinal pigment epithelium. Schwartz was the first to describe elevated IOP associated with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Matsuo later demonstrated the presence of photoreceptor outer segments in the aqueous humor of patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. The postulated mechanism of IOP elevation is the liberation of photoreceptor outer segments, which migrate through the retinal tear into the anterior chamber and impede aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. The photoreceptor segments may be mistaken for an anterior chamber inflammatory reaction or pigment. The IOP tends to normalize after successful surgery to reattach the retina.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Drugs and Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Corticosteroid-&#173;induced glaucoma</span> is an OAG caused by prolonged use of topical, periocular, intravitreal, inhaled, or oral corticosteroids. It mimics POAG in its presentation and clinical course. Approximately one-third of the population without glaucoma demonstrates an IOP elevation of between 6 and 15&#160;mm&#160;Hg in response to corticosteroids, and only a small percentage (4%–6%) has a significant IOP elevation of more than 15&#160;mm&#160;Hg. A high percentage (up to 95%) of patients with POAG demonstrate a response to topical corticosteroids. The type and potency of the agent, the means and frequency of its administration, and the susceptibility of the patient all affect the timing and extent of the IOP rise. Risk factors for corticosteroid-&#173;induced glaucoma include a history of POAG, a first-&#173;degree relative with POAG, very young age (&lt;6&#160;years) or older age, connective tissue disease, type&#160;1 diabetes mellitus, and myopia. The elevated IOP is a result of increased resistance to aqueous outflow in the trabecular meshwork. See also BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for further discussion of corticosteroids.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corticosteroid-induced glaucoma may develop within weeks, months, or years of the drug’s use; thus, IOP should be monitored regularly in patients receiving these agents. In general, the potency of the anti-&#173;inflammatory glucocorticoid activity of a particular drug parallels its ocular hypertensive potency. For example, some corticosteroid preparations, such as fluorometholone, rimexolone, medrysone, or loteprednol, are less likely to raise IOP than are prednisolone, dexamethasone, or difluprednate (see Table&#160;16-13 in BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology</span>). However, even weaker corticosteroids or lower concentrations of stronger drugs can raise IOP in susceptible individuals. A corticosteroid-&#173;induced rise in IOP may cause glaucomatous optic nerve damage in some patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cause of the elevation in IOP may be related to an underlying ocular disease, such as anterior uveitis, as opposed to corticosteroid use. After the corticosteroid is discontinued, the IOP usually decreases with a time course similar to or slightly longer than that of the onset of elevation. However, unmasked POAG or secondary open-&#173;angle inflammatory glaucoma may remain.</p>
			<p class="body-text">IOP may also become elevated in patients who have excessive levels of endogenous corticosteroids (eg, Cushing syndrome). When the corticosteroid-&#173;producing tumor or hyperplastic tissue is excised, IOP generally returns to normal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Periocular injection of corticosteroid may result in elevated IOP. Medical therapy may lower the IOP, but some patients require excision of the depot of corticosteroid or glaucoma surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intravitreal corticosteroid injection may be associated with transient elevations in IOP in more than 50% of patients. Up to 25% of these patients may require topical medications to control IOP, and 1%–2% may require incisional glaucoma surgery. In contrast, intravitreal implants that release corticosteroid are frequently associated with elevated IOP, often requiring patients to undergo incisional glaucoma surgery for IOP control. Surgical treatment has a high success rate in lowering IOP in these patients; laser trabeculoplasty may also be of benefit.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cycloplegic drugs</span> can increase IOP in individuals with open angles. Routine dilation for ophthalmoscopy may increase IOP; those at greater risk include patients with POAG, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or pigment dispersion syndrome, as well as those receiving miotic therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intravitreal injection of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-&#173;VEGF) is a common treatment for exudative macular degeneration. Intravitreal injection may result in a transient rise in IOP, and repeated injections, over time, may result in sustained IOP elevation. The etiology of the elevated IOP is unknown, but theories include increased inflammation and injury to or mechanical blockage of the trabecular meshwork.</p>

Early visual acuity loss was greater in the surgery group, but the differences between groups converged over time. Also, cataracts were more common in the surgery group. At the 8-year follow-&#173;up examination, substantial worsening (≥3&#160;dB) of visual field mean deviation from baseline was found in 21.3% of the initial surgery group and 25.5% of the initial medical group.

Over the course of follow-&#173;up, IOP in the medical therapy group averaged 17–18&#160;mm&#160;Hg (IOP reduction of approximately 38%), whereas IOP in the surgery group averaged 14–15&#160;mm&#160;Hg (IOP reduction of approximately 46%).

			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">Results 2007:</span> The OHTS prediction model for the development of POAG was independently validated in the European Glaucoma Prevention Study.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-22"><span class="sidebar-italic">Results 2010:</span> Topical ocular hypotensive medication was initiated in the original observation group after 7.5&#160;years (median) without medication, and medication was continued for 5.5&#160;years thereafter. Participants in the original medication group continued topical ocular hypotensive medications for a median of 13&#160;years. The proportion of participants who developed POAG was 0.22 in the original observation group and 0.16 in the original medication group. The primary purpose of the follow-&#173;up study was to determine whether delaying treatment resulted in a persistently increased risk of conversion to glaucoma, even after the initiation of therapy. Although the two groups diverged with respect to the development of glaucoma during the original study period (when the observation group did not receive treatment), there was no further divergence in the Kaplan-&#173;Meier curves after both groups received IOP-&#173;lowering <br />treatment.</p>

			<p class="sidebar-h1">Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT) Essentials</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent-"><span class="sidebar-italic">Purpose:</span> To evaluate the effectiveness of lowering IOP in patients with early, newly detected OAG.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">Participants:</span> Patients 50 to 80&#160;years of age with newly diagnosed OAG and early glaucomatous visual field loss were identified mainly through a population-&#173;based screening of more than 44,000&#160;residents of Malmö and Helsingborg, Sweden. Exclusion criteria were advanced visual field loss; mean IOP greater than 30&#160;mm&#160;Hg or any IOP greater than 35&#160;mm&#160;Hg; and visual acuity less than 0.5 (20/40). Two hundred fifty-&#173;five patients were randomized between 1993 and 1997.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">Study design:</span> Multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial comparing observation and treatment with betaxolol and argon laser trabeculoplasty for OAG.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">Results:</span> At 6&#160;years, 62% of untreated patients showed progression, whereas 45% of treated patients progressed. On average, treatment reduced IOP by 25%. In a univariate analysis, risk factors for progression included no IOP-&#173;lowering treatment, older age, higher IOP, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, more advanced visual field loss, and bilateral glaucoma. In multivariate analyses, the risk of progression with IOP-&#173;lowering treatment was reduced by half (HR = 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.35–0.71). Each mm&#160;Hg of IOP lowering decreased the risk of glaucomatous progression by 10%. Risk factors for progression included higher baseline IOP, older age, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, bilateral disease, worse mean deviation, and frequent disc hemorrhages. IOP fluctuation was not found to be a significant risk factor.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text _idGenParaOverride-1">In the observation group, the rate of visual field progression was most rapid in the subgroup of patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome and slowest in those with baseline IOPs within the normal range.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-title">CLINICAL TRIAL 4-4</p>
			<p class="sidebar-h1">Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) Essentials</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent-"><span class="sidebar-italic">Purpose:</span> To compare the clinical outcomes of 2&#160;treatment sequences: argon laser trabeculoplasty–trabeculectomy–trabeculectomy (ATT) and trabeculectomy–argon laser trabeculoplasty–trabeculectomy (TAT).</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">Participants:</span> 789&#160;eyes of 591&#160;patients with medically uncontrolled OAG recruited from 1988 to 1992.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">Study design:</span> Multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial comparing 2&#160;treatment sequences (ATT and TAT) for patients with OAG uncontrolled with medical therapy.</p>
			<p class="figure-caption ParaOverride-23"><span class="CharOverride-1">(Continued on next page)</span></p>
			<p class="figure-caption ParaOverride-24"><span class="CharOverride-1">(continued)</span></p>
			<p class="sidebar-h2 ParaOverride-25"><span class="CharOverride-1">Results</span></p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent-"><span class="sidebar-italic">AGIS 4 and AGIS 13:</span> Black patients treated with the ATT sequence had a lower combined visual acuity and visual field loss than those treated with the TAT sequence. White patients had a lower combined visual acuity and visual field loss at 7&#160;years if initially treated with the TAT sequence. In the initial follow-&#173;up period, white patients in the TAT group had greater visual acuity loss than those in the ATT group; by 7&#160;years, this loss was similar.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">AGIS 5:</span> Encapsulated blebs were slightly more common in patients with prior argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT), but this difference was not statistically significant. The mean IOP at the 4-week postoperative visit was higher in eyes with encapsulated blebs than in those without; with resumption of medical therapy, eyes with and without encapsulated blebs had similar IOPs after 1&#160;year.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">AGIS 6:</span> Visual function scores improved after cataract surgery. Adjustment for cataract did not alter the findings of previous AGIS studies.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">AGIS 7:</span> Lower IOP was associated with less visual field progression. Less visual field progression was noted for eyes with an average IOP of 14&#160;mm&#160;Hg or less during the first 18&#160;months after the first surgical intervention, and for eyes with IOP of 18&#160;mm&#160;Hg or less for all study visits.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">AGIS 8:</span> Approximately half of the study patients developed cataract in the first 5&#160;years of follow-&#173;up. Trabeculectomy increased the relative risk of cataract formation by 78%.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">AGIS 9:</span> Trabeculectomy retards the progression of glaucoma more effectively in white patients than in black patients. ALT was slightly more effective in blacks than in whites.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">AGIS 10:</span> Assessment of optic nerve findings showed good intraobserver but poor interobserver agreement.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">AGIS 11:</span> Reduced effectiveness of ALT was associated with younger age and higher IOP. The ineffectiveness of trabeculectomy was associated with younger age, higher IOP, diabetes mellitus, and postoperative complications (markedly elevated IOP and inflammation).</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">AGIS 12:</span> Risk factors for sustained decrease of the visual field included better baseline visual fields, male sex, worse baseline visual acuity, and diabetes mellitus. Risk factors for sustained decrease in visual acuity included better baseline visual acuity, older age, and less formal education.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">AGIS 14:</span> In patients with visual field progression, a single 6-month confirmatory visual field test had a 72% probability of verifying a persistent defect. When the number of confirmatory visual field tests was increased from 1 to 2, the percentage of eyes that showed a persistent defect increased from 72% to 84%.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-21"><span class="sidebar-italic">2009 AGIS Report:</span> Intraocular pressure fluctuation was an independent predictor of progression of OAG in eyes with lower baseline IOPs, but not in those with higher baseline IOPs.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text">Most of the relevant findings from AGIS that reflect clinical practice are from post hoc analysis; thus, they may not fully take into account unmeasurable confounding factors and enrollment bias.</p>
