			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1 body-text--no-indent-"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Topical ophthalmic medications, cosmetics, and environmental substances can occasionally trigger a local allergic reaction. Hypersensitivity reactions are divided into 4&#160;types in the Gell and Coombs classification. Type&#160;I reactions are immunoglobulin (Ig)&#160;E mediated, and type&#160;IV reactions are T-cell mediated; see BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for further details.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Type&#160;I (immediate hypersensitivity) reactions typically occur within minutes after exposure to an allergen. Ocular reactions are associated with itching, eyelid erythema and swelling, and conjunctival hyperemia and chemosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-1</span>). In rare cases, signs of systemic anaphylaxis may develop in the patient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A type&#160;IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction usually begins 24–72&#160;hours following instillation of a topical agent. Patients are often sensitized by previous exposure to the offending drug or preservative. An acute eczematous reaction develops with erythema, leathery thickening, and scaling of the eyelid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-2</span>). Sequelae of chronic contact blepharoconjunctivitis include hyperpigmentation, dermal scarring, and lower eyelid ectropion. A papillary conjunctivitis and a mucoid or mucopurulent discharge may develop. Punctate epithelial erosions may be noted on the inferior cornea. Medications and preservatives that are commonly associated with contact blepharoconjunctivitis include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-3">cycloplegics such as atropine and homatropine</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">aminoglycosides such as neomycin, gentamicin, and tobramycin</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">antiviral agents such as idoxuridine and trifluridine</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-nosp">preservatives such as thimerosal and EDTA</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Treatment of hypersensitivity reactions requires the identification and discontinuation of the offending agent. Usually, the history provides the necessary clues, but sometimes a “challenge test” is necessary to confirm a suspicion. Such tests should never be done in patients with a known systemic allergy to a drug.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Initial management of type&#160;I hypersensitivity reactions includes allergen avoidance or discontinuation of the causative agent. Adjunctive therapy may involve the use of cold compresses, artificial lubricants, topical antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers, and/or nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain. Topical vasoconstrictors, either alone or in combination with antihistamines, may provide acute symptomatic relief but should not be used long term.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Type&#160;IV hypersensitivity reactions are also treated with allergen withdrawal. In severe cases, a brief (several-&#173;day) course of mild topical corticosteroids or tacrolimus ointment (0.03% or 0.10%) applied to the eyelids and periocular skin may speed resolution of eyelid and conjunctival inflammation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Atopic Dermatitis</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Atopic dermatitis is a chronic condition in genetically susceptible individuals that usually begins in infancy or childhood and may or may not involve the external eye. The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis involves a type&#160;IV hypersensitivity reaction, increased IgE hypersensitivity, an increase in histamine released from mast cells and basophils, and impaired cell-&#173;mediated immunity.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis include pruritus, lesions on the eyelid and other sites (eg, joint flexures in adolescents and adults, face and extensor surfaces in infants and young children), and a personal or family history of other atopic disorders, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and aspirin hypersensitivity. Other ocular findings include periorbital darkening, exaggerated eyelid folds, meibomianitis, ectropion, and chronic papillary conjunctivitis. The appearance of the skin lesions varies depending on the age of the patient. Infants typically have an erythematous rash, children tend to have eczematous dermatitis with secondary lichenification from scratching, and adults have scaly patches with thickened and wrinkled dry skin.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Allergens in the environment and in foods should be identified and minimized whenever possible. In general, the services of an allergist should be sought. Moisturizing lotions and petrolatum gels can be useful for skin hydration. Acute lesions can be controlled with a topical corticosteroid cream or ointment (clobetasone butyrate 0.05%), but long-term use of such medications is strongly discouraged to avoid skin thinning and ocular complications of corticosteroids (eg, cataract, glaucoma). Topical tacrolimus ointment 0.03% or 0.1% is also effective and has fewer adverse effects. Oral antipruritic agents such as antihistamines and mast-cell stabilizers can alleviate itching but may exacerbate dry eye with their anticholinergic activity.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Hay Fever Conjunctivitis and Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1 body-text--no-indent-"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Hay fever (seasonal) conjunctivitis and perennial allergic conjunctivitis are largely type&#160;I hypersensitivity reactions. The allergen, which is typically airborne, enters the tear film and comes into contact with conjunctival mast cells that bear allergen-&#173;specific IgE antibodies. Degranulation of mast cells releases histamine and a variety of other inflammatory mediators that promote vasodilation, edema, and recruitment of other inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils. In a presensitized individual, the activation and degranulation of mast cells can be triggered within minutes of allergen exposure.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Patients with hay fever conjunctivitis often have other atopic conditions, such as allergic rhinitis or asthma. Symptoms develop rapidly after allergen exposure and consist of itching, eyelid swelling, conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, and mucoid discharge. Intense itching is a hallmark symptom. Attacks are usually short lived and episodic.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> The diagnosis of hay fever conjunctivitis is generally made clinically. Conjunctival scrapings reveal the characteristic eosinophils, which are not normally present on the ocular surface. Challenge testing with a panel of allergens can be performed.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Efforts should first be directed at avoidance or abatement of allergen exposure. Thorough cleaning (or changing) of unclean or old carpets, linens, and bedding can be effective in removing accumulated allergens such as animal dander and house dust mites. Contributing factors, including contact lenses and dry eye, should be identified, as they can play an important role in facilitating allergen contact with the ocular surface. Glasses or goggles can also serve as physical barriers. Treatment should be based on the severity of patient symptoms and includes one or more of the following:</p>
			<p class="bullet-list-head"><span class="italic">Supportive</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">cold compresses</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">artificial tears</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="bullet-list-head"><span class="italic">Topical</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">topical antihistamines and mast-cell stabilizers</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">topical NSAIDs</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">judicious, selective use of topical corticosteroids</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">topical vasoconstrictors</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="bullet-list-head"><span class="italic">Systemic</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">oral antihistamines (may be effective for the short term but may be associated with increased dry eye)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Artificial tears are beneficial in diluting and flushing away allergens and other inflammatory mediators. Topical vasoconstrictors, alone or in combination with antihistamines, may provide acute symptom relief. However, their use for more than 5–7&#160;consecutive <br />days may predispose to compensatory chronic vascular dilation. Topical mast cell–stabilizing agents such as cromolyn sodium and lodoxamide tromethamine may be useful for treating seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Treatment effects usually require continued use over 7 or more days; hence, these drugs are generally ineffective in the acute phase of hay fever conjunctivitis. Topical cyclosporine and oral antihistamines may provide symptom relief in some patients. Hyposensitization injections (immunotherapy) can be beneficial if the offending allergen has been identified. Certain topical NSAIDs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in ocular atopy, but their efficacy varies greatly. Reports of corneal perforations with the use of NSAIDs, especially the generic forms, suggest the need for careful monitoring. Refills should be limited, and follow-&#173;up appointments need to be maintained. Topical corticosteroids are very effective in managing ocular allergy; however, they should be reserved for cases unresponsive to other treatments and must be used with caution. If corticosteroids are prescribed, patients must be clearly informed of the risks and closely monitored for adverse effects. Topical tacrolimus can be used to treat the associated dermatitis. See BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> for a discussion of topical antihistamines and mast-cell stabilizers.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a seasonally recurring, bilateral inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva that occurs predominantly in young males, who frequently, but not invariably, have a personal or family history of atopy. The disease may persist year-round in tropical climates. The immunopathogenesis seems to involve both types&#160;I and IV hypersensitivity reactions. The conjunctival inflammatory infiltrate in VKC consists of eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and monocytes.</p>

			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Symptoms consist of itching, blepharospasm, photophobia, blurred vision, and copious mucoid discharge. Clinically, 2&#160;forms of VKC may be seen: palpebral and limbal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The inflammation in palpebral VKC is located predominantly on the palpebral conjunctiva, where a diffuse papillary hypertrophy develops, usually more prominently in the upper region. Bulbar conjunctival hyperemia and chemosis may also occur. In more severe cases, giant papillae resembling cobblestones may develop on the upper tarsus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Limbal VKC may develop alone or in association with palpebral VKC. It occurs predominantly in patients of African or Asian descent and is more prevalent in hot climates. The limbus has a thickened, gelatinous appearance, with scattered opalescent mounds and vascular injection. Horner-&#173;Trantas dots, whitish macroaggregates of degenerated eosinophils and epithelial cells, may be seen in the hypertrophied limbus of patients with limbal VKC (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several types of corneal changes associated with upper-&#173;tarsal lesions may also develop in VKC. Punctate epithelial erosions in the superior and central cornea are frequently noted. Pannus occurs most commonly in the superior cornea, but occasionally 360° corneal vascularization may develop. Oval or shield-shaped noninfectious epithelial ulcers (the so-called shield ulcer) with underlying stromal opacification may develop in the superior or central cornea (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-5</span>). An association between VKC and keratoconus has been reported. Stem cell deficiency may also occur in severe cases.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Therapy should be based on the severity of the patient’s symptoms and the ocular surface disease. Mild cases may be successfully managed with topical antihistamines. Climatotherapy, such as the use of home air-&#173;conditioning or relocation to a cooler environment, can be helpful. Patients with mild to moderate disease may respond to topical mast-cell stabilizers. In patients with seasonal exacerbations, these drops are typically started at least 2&#160;weeks before symptoms usually begin. In patients with year-round disease, long-term maintenance dosing can be used. Severe cases may require the use of topical corticosteroids. Because of the likely development of corticosteroid-&#173;related complications from long-term administration, however, these drugs should be reserved for exacerbations that result in moderate to severe discomfort and/or decreased vision. During these exacerbations, intermittent (pulse) therapy is very effective. Topical corticosteroids can be used relatively frequently (eg, every 2&#160;hours) for 5–7&#160;days and then rapidly tapered. Because of the propensity of particles of suspended corticosteroid (eg, prednisolone acetate) to lodge between papillae, the use of less &#173;potent but soluble corticosteroids such as dexamethasone phosphate is generally preferred. Low-dose steroids can be useful in some cases for maintenance treatment of VKC. Whenever steroids are prescribed, the potential dangers of long-term topical corticosteroid use are critical to review to emphasize the importance of close follow-&#173;up and monitoring for adverse effects.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cooperative patients can be offered an alternative to topical delivery that avoids the problem of continuing self-&#173;medication: supratarsal injection of corticosteroid. The supratarsal subconjunctival space is located superior to the upper border of the superior tarsus and is most easily reached by everting the upper eyelid. After the upper eyelid is everted and the supratarsal conjunctiva has been anesthetized, supratarsal injection of 0.5–1.0&#160;mL of either a relatively short-&#173;acting corticosteroid such as dexamethasone phosphate (4&#160;mg/mL) or a longer-&#173;acting corticosteroid such as triamcinolone acetonide (40&#160;mg/mL) can be performed. Monitoring of intraocular pressure is mandatory, as corticosteroid spikes are possible. The importance of close follow-&#173;up with an eye care provider is essential to monitor for cataract formation or permanent vision loss.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Steroid-sparing agents have been shown to be effective. Topical cyclosporine 0.5%–2.0% applied 2–4&#160;times daily, topical tacrolimus ointment 0.03%–0.10% applied twice daily, or tacrolimus suspension 0.10% can also be used to treat refractory cases of VKC. Reported adverse effects of cyclosporine include punctate epithelial keratopathy and ocular surface irritation. Systemic anti-inflammatory therapy should be reserved for very severe cases.</p>

			<p class="h2">Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> One or more manifestations of atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) develop in approximately one-third of patients with atopic dermatitis. Atopic individuals show signs of type&#160;I hypersensitivity responses as well as depressed systemic cell-&#173;mediated immunity. As a consequence of this altered immunity, they are susceptible to herpes simplex virus keratitis and colonization of the eyelids with <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus.</span> Complications related to this predisposition to infection may contribute to, or compound, the primary immunopathogenic manifestations. AKC is primarily a type&#160;IV reaction; therefore, the use of mast-cell therapy may not be effective.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> The ocular findings of AKC are similar to those of VKC (discussed earlier in the chapter), with the following differences:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Patients with AKC frequently have disease year-round, with minimal seasonal exacerbation.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Patients with AKC are older.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The papillae are more apt to be small or medium-sized than giant.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The papillae occur in the upper and lower palpebral conjunctiva.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Milky conjunctival edema, with variable subepithelial fibrosis, is often present (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-6</span>).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Extensive corneal vascularization and opacification secondary to chronic epithelial disease (likely due to some degree of direct trauma from eyelid changes and/or limbal stem cell dysfunction) can occur (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-7</span>).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Eosinophils in conjunctival cytology specimens are less numerous and are less often degranulated.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Conjunctival scarring often occurs, with occasional symblepharon formation.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Posterior subcapsular and/or multifaceted or shield-shaped anterior subcapsular lens opacities may develop.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-8">Corneal findings include persistent epithelial defects, an increased incidence of ectatic corneal diseases such as keratoconus and pellucid marginal degeneration (possible association with eye rubbing), and an increased incidence of staphylococcal and herpes simplex infections.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Treatment of AKC involves allergen avoidance and the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents similar to those used in the treatment of VKC. Cold compresses may also be of benefit. In addition, patients should be carefully monitored for complications of infectious diseases that may warrant specific therapy, such as secondary staphylococcal infections and herpes simplex keratitis, which is more common and more likely to be bilateral in patients with AKC (see Chapter&#160;9).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In severe cases, the indications for systemic therapy include chronic ocular surface inflammation unresponsive to topical treatment, ocular discomfort, progressive cicatrization, and peripheral ulcerative keratopathy. Systemic immunosuppression (eg, cyclosporine or tacrolimus) should be monitored in coordination with an internist or rheumatologist. Systemic treatment of AKC may be beneficial in suppressing the interleukin-2 (IL)-2 response, which promotes lymphocyte proliferation.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Ligneous Conjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ligneous conjunctivitis is a rare, chronic autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the formation of firm (“woody”), yellowish fibrinous pseudomembranes on the conjunctival surface (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-8</span>). These membranes are composed of an admixture of fibrin, fibrin-&#173;bound tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), epithelial cells, and mixed inflammatory cells that adhere to the conjunctival surface. Latent and activated forms of matrix metalloproteinase-9 have also been identified.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The cause of ligneous conjunctivitis has been linked to severe type&#160;I plasminogen deficiency, with hypofibrinolysis as the primary defect. More than 12% of patients have severe hypoplasminogenemia. The genetic defect in the plasminogen gene <span class="italic">(PLG)</span> is located at band 6q26.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Ligneous conjunctivitis can affect patients of all ages. Patients pre&#173;sent with symptoms of ocular irritation and foreign-&#173;body sensation. The cardinal finding consists of yellowish, platelike masses that overlie one or more of the palpebral surfaces and are readily visible with eversion of the eyelid (see Fig&#160;11-8). Ligneous conjunctivitis is generally bilateral and frequently recurs after excision.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Cultures can be taken at initial diagnosis to exclude a bacterial pseudomembranous or membranous conjunctivitis. Surgical excision with or without adjunctive cryotherapy has been advocated. However, recurrences are frequent. Use of purified plasminogen, fresh frozen plasma, heparin, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and amniotic membrane has been reported. No single treatment has been shown to be consistently effective or superior. Many cases of ligneous conjunctivitis eventually resolve spontaneously after several months to a few years.</p>

			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> SJS and TEN are hypersensitivity reactions to infectious diseases (eg, due to herpes simplex virus, adenovirus, or streptococcal bacteria) or, predominantly, to drugs. Approximately 80% of TEN and 50%–80% of SJS cases are thought to be drug induced; the conjunctiva and oropharynx are the tissues most frequently involved. Although more than 100&#160;drugs of various classes have been found to be associated with SJS–TEN, sulfonamides, anticonvulsants, NSAIDs, and allopurinol are frequently implicated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the pathogenesis of the disease is not completely understood, in cases of drug-&#173;induced SJS and TEN, the keratinocyte apoptosis is thought to be triggered by drug-&#173;specific cytotoxic T&#160;lymphocytes via the perforin–granzyme pathway. As granzyme enters a target cell through the perforin channels, it leads to keratinocyte apoptosis. If Fas is the death receptor protein on the target cell membrane, extension of the apoptosis can result. Granule-&#173;mediated exocytosis, mainly of perforin and granzyme&#160;B or Fas-Fas ligand (FasL, or CD95L) interactions, is thought to play a role. One report demonstrated that blister cells from skin lesions of patients with SJS or TEN consisted mainly of cytotoxic T&#160;lymphocytes and natural killer cells and that both the blister fluid and the cells were cytotoxic. Gene expression profiling identified granulysin as the most highly expressed cytotoxic molecule. Results of studies investigating the association between HLA class&#160;I and&#160;II antigens and SJS–TEN suggest that there are strong ethnic differences in the HLA–SJS associations.</p>

			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Fever, arthralgia, malaise, and upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms are usually sudden in onset. Skin eruption follows within a few days, with a classic “target” lesion consisting of a red center surrounded by a pale ring and then a red ring, although maculopapular or bullous lesions are also common. The mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth, and genitalia may be affected by bullous lesions with membrane or pseudomembrane formation. New lesions may appear over 4–6&#160;weeks, with approximately 2-week cycles for each crop of lesions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The primary ocular finding is a mucopurulent conjunctivitis and episcleritis. Conjunctival and corneal epithelial sloughing and necrosis with severe inflammation and scarring may develop (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-9</span>). Patients are at risk of infection because of loss of the epithelial barrier. Ocular surface cicatrization results in long-term ocular complications such as conjunctival shrinkage, eyelid margin keratinization, trichiasis, and tear deficiency. Eyelid margin keratinization and scarring are important risk factors for poor long-term outcomes in these patients.</p>

			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Management of acute and chronic disease should be distinguished.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="italic">Acute phase.</span> Acute SJS, SJS/TEN overlap, and TEN are medical emergencies with significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Management requires a team-based approach, similar to that used for thermal burn victims, and includes intensive care providers, anesthesiologists, surgeons who specialize in the treatment of burns, and ophthalmologists. The offending agent must be immediately discontinued. Systemic therapy is mainly supportive and is aimed at managing dehydration and superinfection. Systemic treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents remains controversial.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The mainstay of acute ocular therapy is lubrication with preservative-&#173;free artificial tears and ointments and vigilant surveillance for the early manifestations of ocular infections. Topical antibiotics are sometimes used as prophylaxis. The efficacy of topical corticosteroids for the ocular manifestations of this condition remains controversial. Symblepharon may form during the acute phase because the raw, necrotic palpebral and bulbar conjunctival surfaces can adhere to one another (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-10</span>). Repeated conjunctival lysis of the symblepharon may exacerbate inflammation and surface morbidity. Significant long-term benefit has been demonstrated with early amniotic membrane transplantation covering the entire ocular surface, including the eyelid margins. This is one of the few potentially beneficial therapeutic interventions for this devastating disease. Amniotic membrane grafting should be performed very early in the course of this disease to prevent serious sequelae. Various techniques can be used, and the procedure can be done in the operating room or at the bedside for patients who cannot be taken to the operating room immediately.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="italic">Chronic phase.</span> Management of chronic SJS, SJS/TEN overlap, and TEN, as summarized by Jain et al, is targeted at treating dry eye and mechanical abnormalities of the eyelids and eyelashes (which cause ocular surface trauma and inflammation), as well as rehabilitation of vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Dry eye is a significant problem secondary to scarring of the ocular surface and damage to the meibomian glands. Chronic dryness contributes to the development of further ocular surface damage, epithelial defects, symblephara, and limbal stem cell deficiency. Eyelid sequelae such as entropion, trichiasis, and keratinization, which result from cicatrizing conjunctivitis, cause chronic ocular surface irritation and inflammation. Treatment of dry eye includes lubrication (preservative free), punctal occlusion, and eyelid hygiene. Topical and systemic corticosteroids have been reported to help reduce active inflammation but must be used with caution and under close monitoring. Depending on the extent of the chronic disease, other treatment options include debridement of keratin from eyelid margins, use of scleral lenses, salivary gland transplantation, and mucous membrane grafting.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vision rehabilitation in patients with chronic disease is challenging and high risk. Prosthetic replacement of the ocular surface ecosystem (PROSE; BostonSight, Needham, MA), a custom-&#173;designed prosthetic device to support impaired ocular surface system functions, may improve patient comfort and vision and help certain patients avoid surgery. Surgical treatments should be avoided unless there are no other options, as they carry significant risks and limitations, which must be fully explained to the patient. Limbal stem cell transplantation and cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation have been reported. Penetrating keratoplasty in patients with chronic disease is associated with an extremely poor prognosis and is generally reserved for eyes with progressive thinning or perforation. In desperate cases, rare favorable results have been achieved with a keratoprosthesis. Unfortunately, many patients with chronic SJS, SJS/TEN overlap, or TEN are young and left with lifelong ocular morbidity. Rehabilitation is hindered not only by sequelae of the acute disease, but also by ongoing, chronic immune deviation of the ocular surface.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The exact mechanism of mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), formerly called <span class="italic">ocular cicatricial pemphigoid,</span> remains unknown, although MMP may represent a cytotoxic (type&#160;II) hypersensitivity, in which cell injury results from the action of autoantibodies directed against a cell surface antigen in the basement membrane zone (BMZ). Bullous pemphigoid antigen&#160;II (BP180) and its soluble extracellular domains have been identified as possible autoantigens. Antibody activates complement, with a subsequent breakdown of the conjunctival membrane. A number of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor <span class="greek--tx-">a</span> (TNF-<span class="greek--tx-">a</span>), are overexpressed. TNF-<span class="greek--tx-">a</span> has been shown to induce the expression of migration inhibition factor, a cytokine found to have elevated levels in the conjunctival tissues of patients with MMP. Macrophage colony-&#173;stimulating factor has also been shown to have an increased expression in the conjunctival tissue of patients with active MMP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cellular immunity may also play a role. HLA-DR4, a special genetic locus in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), has been associated with this condition, but not all affected individuals are positive for this background; hence, HLA typing is not useful for diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pseudopemphigoid, which has a clinical picture similar to that of pemphigoid, has been associated with the long-term use of certain topical ophthalmic medications. Case reports have implicated pilocarpine, epinephrine, timolol, idoxuridine, echothiophate iodide, and demecarium bromide. The main difference between pseudopemphigoid and true pemphigoid is that in the former, disease progression generally ceases once the offending agent is recognized and removed. The clinical findings of pseudopemphigoid are similar to those of ocular MMP, and immunohistologic evaluation of biopsied tissue can be helpful.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Mucous membrane pemphigoid is a chronic cicatrizing conjunctivitis of autoimmune etiology. Although it is a vesiculobullous disease primarily involving the conjunctiva, it frequently affects other mucous membranes, including those of the mouth and oropharynx, genitalia, and anus. Difficulty swallowing may be an important early symptom. Skin involvement can occur in some cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with MMP are usually older than 60&#160;years at the time of diagnosis. They often present with recurrent attacks of mild and nonspecific conjunctival inflammation with an occasional mucopurulent discharge. Patients with early MMP may present with conjunctival hyperemia, edema, ulceration, and tear dysfunction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">According to the Foster staging system, close examination of the conjunctiva in the early stages of the disease (stage&#160;I) reveals subepithelial fibrosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-11</span>). Fine gray-white linear opacities, best seen with an intense but thin slit beam, appear in the deep conjunctiva. However, in many cases, the disease in its early stages produces nonspecific symptoms with minimal overt physical findings, such as chronic red eye. Oral mucosal lesions may be a clue that can lead to early diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Transient bullae of the conjunctiva rupture, leading to subepithelial fibrosis. Loss of goblet cells, shortening of the inferior fornices (stage II), symblepharon formation (stage&#160;III; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-12</span>), and, on occasion, restricted ocular motility with extensive adhesions between the eyelid and the globe (stage&#160;IV) can follow. Ophthalmologists should attempt to diagnose this condition in its early stages and watch for an inferior fornix depth of less than 8&#160;mm, which is abnormal and should prompt further evaluation. A subtle inferior symblepharon can be detected when the lower eyelid is pulled down while the patient looks up.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Recurrent attacks of conjunctival inflammation can lead to destruction of goblet cells and eventually obstruction of the lacrimal gland ductules. The resultant aqueous and mucous tear deficiency leads to keratinization of the already thickened conjunctiva. Entropion and trichiasis may develop as scarring progresses, leading to abrasions, corneal vascularization, further scarring, ulceration, and epidermalization of the ocular surface. Corneal abrasions in these patients are emergencies and must be treated immediately to minimize progression to perforation, scarring, and ankyloblepharon formation. Although the clinical course varies, progressive deterioration usually occurs in untreated cases. Remissions and exacerbations are common. Surgical intervention can incite further scarring but may be essential in managing entropion and trichiasis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of cicatrizing conjunctivitis includes 4&#160;major categories, which are listed in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;11-1</span>. The diagnosis of unilateral MMP should be made with caution because other diseases, including many of those listed in Table&#160;11-1, may masquerade as MMP. Also, linear IgA dermatosis, a rare dermatologic condition, can result in an ocular syndrome that is clinically identical to MMP and requires similar treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with unexplained persistent epithelial defects (ie, after cataract surgery), MMP should be considered in the differential diagnosis and the patient carefully examined for any other signs of the disease.</p>

			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Although MMP is a bilateral disease, one eye may be more severely involved than the other. Pathologic support for a diagnosis of pemphigoid can be obtained from direct immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase staining of conjunctival biopsy specimens. False-&#173;negative results are not uncommon, however.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Biopsy specimens should be obtained from an actively affected area of the conjunctiva or, if involvement is diffuse, from the inferior conjunctival fornix. Oral mucosal biopsies may be useful, especially in the presence of an active lesion. In pseudopemphigoid, conjunctival biopsies may or may not be positive for immunoreactants. Immunohistochemical staining techniques can demonstrate complement&#160;3, IgG, IgM, and/or IgA localized in the epithelial BMZ of the conjunctiva in pemphigoid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-13</span>). Circulating anti–basement membrane antibody has been identified in some patients with pemphigoid. End-stage disease may produce negative results because of the destruction of basement membrane.

			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h5-head">management</span> A multidisciplinary approach is required in the management of MMP. It is helpful to involve an ophthalmologist who specializes in the treatment of this disease, and collaboration with other providers who have experience using systemic treatment is recommended to maximize patient outcome. Classifying patients according to their risk for disease progression (low or high) is valuable when appropriate therapy is being determined. Because progression is often slow, careful clinical staging of the disease and photo documentation (with the patient in differing positions of gaze) are generally recommended in evaluation of the disease course and response to therapy. Different staging systems to determine disease severity have been developed. Mondino and Brown staged MMP by the amount of inferior fornix depth lost. The Foster staging system is based on the presence or absence of specific clinical findings. Tauber proposed a modification to these staging systems (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;11-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is important to remember that MMP is a systemic disease. Topical treatments (steroids, cyclosporine&#160;A, tacrolimus) may help alleviate symptoms but will not prevent disease progression. Systemic therapy is required. Several systemic therapies have been reported for the treatment of MMP, with regimens varying depending on the severity of the disease and the presence or absence of sight-&#173;threatening complications. Cyclophosphamide remains a mainstay of therapy for severe disease when sight is threatened. The use of intravenous immunoglobulin, anti-&#173;TNF-<span class="greek--tx-">a</span> medications, and rituximab has been reported in patients who were unresponsive to or who experienced complications from conventional treatments.</p>
			<p class="body-text">These systemic treatments have significant adverse effects, including death; thus, it is critical for the ophthalmologist to partner with providers who are experienced in the administration and management of these treatments (ie, rheumatologists, hematologists, oncologists).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any procedure or surgery (eyelid, intraocular) can cause disease flare, so adequate immunosuppression therapy is necessary. Also, surgical correction of eyelid deformities or treatment of trichiasis is important. In severe cases, hard palate and buccal mucosal grafting can be useful techniques in fornix reconstruction. Punctal occlusion, which may have already resulted from cicatrization, can be useful in the management of any associated dry eye condition. In general, patients with cicatrizing conjunctivitis have a higher rate of spontaneous extrusion of silicone punctal plugs; thus, permanent punctal occlusion with cautery is often required. Standard penetrating keratoplasty in MMP patients with severe corneal disease is generally associated with a very guarded prognosis. In patients who become blind due to MMP, keratoprosthesis surgery, performed as a last resort, has achieved some success. It is often difficult to distinguish sequelae of uncontrolled disease from inflammation secondary to structural and mechanical problems related to prior active disease. Careful examination is critical to determine whether there is active disease requiring further control.</p>

Severe filamentary keratitis can be treated with mucolytic agents (acetylcysteine 10%) or bandage contact lenses. Topical cyclosporine or tacrolimus may also be useful in controlling ocular GVHD. Visual disturbances are more commonly due to surface irregularity, but these patients also have a high rate of posterior subcapsular cataracts, which contribute to decreased vision. Autologous serum tears may also be considered.

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Conjunctivitis/Episcleritis Associated With Reactive Arthritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Reactive arthritis (formerly called <span class="italic">Reiter syndrome</span>) is a systemic disorder characterized by the classic triad of ocular (conjunctivitis/episcleritis, iridocyclitis, or keratitis), urethral, and joint inflammation. The joint inflammation is often highly asymmetric and involves a few joints (oligoarticular). These manifestations can appear simultaneously or separately, in any sequence. Less common manifestations include keratoderma blennorrhagicum (a scaling skin eruption), balanitis, aphthous stomatitis, fever, lymphadenopathy, pneumonitis, pericarditis, and myocarditis. Attacks are self-&#173;limited, lasting from 2 to several months, but they may recur periodically over the course of several years.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Reactive arthritis may occur after dysentery due to gram-&#173;negative bacteria (most frequently <span class="italic">Salmonella, Shigella,</span> and <span class="italic">Yersinia </span>species) or after nongonococcal urethritis caused by <span class="italic">Chlamydia&#160;trachomatis.</span> More than 75% of patients with reactive arthritis are HLA-B27–positive. See BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for discussion of HLA-B27–related diseases and illustrations of nonocular manifestations of reactive arthritis.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> The most common ocular finding in reactive arthritis is a bilateral papillary conjunctivitis with mucopurulent discharge, which has been reported in 30%–60% of patients. The conjunctivitis is self-&#173;limited, lasting for days to weeks. Some patients present more often with episcleritis rather than with conjunctivitis. Mild nongranulomatous anterior uveitis has been reported to occur in 3%–12% of patients. Various forms of keratitis—including diffuse punctate epithelial erosions, superficial or deep focal infiltrates, or superficial or deep vascularization—may occur in rare cases. Reactive arthritis should be considered in any case of chronic, nonfollicular, mucopurulent conjunctivitis with negative culture results.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Treatment is mainly palliative. Corneal infiltrates and vascularization often respond to topical corticosteroids. Systemic treatment of any related infection with oral antibiotics may be beneficial. Occasionally, the intraocular (uveitic) component of the disease can be very severe and require systemic immunosuppression (see BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis</span>).</p>

			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> This condition, first reported by Thygeson in 1950, is characterized by recurrent episodes of tearing, foreign-&#173;body sensation, photophobia, and reduced vision. It affects children to older adults and is typically bilateral, although it may develop initially in 1&#160;eye or may be markedly asymmetric in some cases. The hallmark finding is multiple (up to 40 but as few as 2–3) slightly elevated corneal epithelial lesions with “negative staining,” which are noted during exacerbations. The epithelial lesions are round or oval conglomerates of gray, granular, or “crumblike” opacities associated with minimal conjunctival reaction, in contrast to adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. High magnification reveals each opacity to be a cluster of multiple smaller pinpoint opacities (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-15</span>). A characteristic feature is the waxing and waning appearance of individual epithelial opacities, which change in location and number over time. The greatest density of these lesions is typically found in the central cornea. The raised punctate epithelial lesions themselves stain faintly with fluorescein and rose bengal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">No conjunctival inflammatory reaction is noted during exacerbations, but occasionally patients have mild bulbar conjunctival hyperemia. In rare cases, a mild subepithelial opacity may develop under the epithelial lesion—more commonly in patients who have received topical antiviral therapy. The important facet of this condition is that the patient’s symptoms may far exceed the apparent signs; frequently, patients report severe photophobia and foreign-&#173;body sensation in the setting of only a few central epithelial lesions.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Supportive therapy with artificial tears is often adequate in mild cases. Treatment alternatives for persistently symptomatic cases include low-dose topical corticosteroids and bandage contact lenses. Currently, antiviral therapy is not the standard of care, as there are no firm data to associate this condition with an active replicative viral infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If a topical corticosteroid is prescribed, a very mild preparation may be effective (eg, fluorometholone 0.1%). Because the lesions are quite responsive to corticosteroids, treatment will hasten their resolution, but they frequently recur in the same or different locations on the cornea after the topical corticosteroids are stopped. Overall, corticosteroid use should be minimized in these cases and monitored closely because of their associated risks. Topical cyclosporine or tacrolimus ophthalmic preparations may also be effective in causing regression of the lesions. It is important to remember to treat the symptoms, not the clinical findings, in patients with Thygeson SPK.</p>

			<p class="h2">Interstitial Keratitis Associated With Infectious Diseases</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Interstitial keratitis (IK) is a nonsuppurative inflammation of the corneal stroma that features cellular infiltration and usually vascularization without primary involvement of the epithelium or endothelium. Most cases result from a type&#160;IV hypersensitivity response to infectious microorganisms or other antigens in the corneal stroma. The topographic distribution (diffuse versus focal or multifocal) and depth of the stromal infiltration, in addition to associated systemic signs, are useful in determining the cause of IK.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Congenital syphilis was the first infection to be linked with IK. Herpes simplex virus, which accounts for most cases of stromal keratitis, and varicella-&#173;zoster virus keratitis are discussed earlier in this volume.

			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Keratitis may be caused by either congenital or acquired syphilis, although most cases are associated with congenital syphilis. Manifestations of congenital syphilis that occur early in life (within the first 2&#160;years) are infectious. However, IK is a later, immune-&#173;mediated manifestation of congenital syphilis. Affected children typically show no evidence of corneal disease in their first years; stromal keratitis lasting for several weeks develops late in the first decade of life (or even later). These patients may also have nonocular signs of congenital syphilis:</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Widely spaced, peg-shaped teeth; eighth nerve deafness; and interstitial keratitis constitute the Hutchinson triad. Congenital syphilitic keratitis is bilateral in 80% of cases, although both eyes may not be affected simultaneously or to the same degree. Initial symptoms are pain, tearing, photophobia, and perilimbal injection. The inflammation may last for weeks if left untreated. Sectoral superior stromal inflammation and keratic precipitates are typically seen early in the disease course. As the disease progresses, deep stromal neovascularization develops. Eventually, the inflammation spreads centrally, and corneal opacification and edema may develop. In some cases, the deep corneal vascularization becomes so intense that the cornea appears pink—hence the term <span class="italic">salmon patch</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-16</span>). Sequelae of stromal keratitis include corneal scarring, corneal thinning, and ghost vessels in the deep layers of the stroma. Vision may be reduced because of irregular astigmatism and stromal opacification.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Stromal keratitis develops only rarely in acquired (as opposed to congenital) syphilis and, if it does, is unilateral in 60% of cases. The ocular findings are similar to those seen in congenital syphilitic keratitis. In general, uveitis and retinitis are much more common manifestations of acquired syphilis than keratitis.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation and management</span> A diagnosis of congenital syphilis is confirmed by identification of <span class="italic">Treponema&#160;pallidum</span> by dark-field microscopy or fluorescent antibody. The detection of specific IgM is currently the most sensitive serologic method. During the acute phase, ocular inflammation should be treated with cycloplegic drugs and topical corticosteroids to limit stromal inflammation and late scarring. The corneal disease can be suppressed with topical corticosteroids. If untreated, the disease can “burn out” over time; because it can lead to severe corneal opacification, earlier treatment can be beneficial in preventing ophthalmic sequelae. Patients with findings of IK should have a workup for syphilis. Systemic syphilis (or neuroretinal manifestations) should be treated with penicillin or an appropriate alternative antibiotic in accordance with the protocol for either congenital or acquired syphilis. The necessity of lumbar puncture in syphilitic IK is uncertain, and any patient with suspected syphilis should be referred for immediate consultation with a specialist in infectious diseases.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-15">Cogan Syndrome</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Cogan syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder, the etiology of which is obscure. However, the disease shares some clinicopathologic features with polyarteritis nodosa. Progressive ocular and audiovestibular symptoms—which can lead to blindness, deafness, and even death from systemic vasculitits—develop in affected patients.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Cogan syndrome typically occurs in young adults and produces stromal keratitis, vertigo, and hearing loss. The history may reveal a recent upper respiratory tract infection, bout of diarrhea, dental infection, or immunization. The earliest corneal findings are bilateral faint, white subepithelial infiltrates resembling those occurring in viral keratoconjunctivitis but located in the peripheral cornea. Multifocal nodular infiltrates may develop in the posterior cornea later. A systemic vasculitis that presents as polyarteritis nodosa occurs in some patients.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> When the cause of stromal keratitis is not apparent, a VDRL or rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test and FTA-ABS or microhemagglutination assay for <span class="italic">T pallidum</span> are performed (VDRL and RPR tests may become nonreactive in congenital syphilis). Other infectious syndromes should also be considered. Antibodies to chlamydia have been reported in cases of Cogan syndrome. The presence of autoantibodies against the inner ear and endothelial antigens has been reported in some patients with Cogan syndrome. Hearing testing should be performed when Cogan syndrome is being considered. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or the C-reactive protein (CRP) level may be elevated. Fifty percent of patients with Cogan syndrome may test positive for anti–heat shock protein antibodies. Also, case reports have noted that affected patients test positive for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibody (ANA), and anticardiolipin antibodies. However, laboratory findings are not consistent in Cogan syndrome, and there is no definitive test. This syndrome thus remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and it must be considered early on in the differential diagnosis of any patient who has the symptoms and clinical findings mentioned earlier.</p>

			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> The acute keratitis of Cogan syndrome is treated with frequent topical corticosteroids. Oral corticosteroids are recommended for the vestibular and auditory symptoms because this treatment improves the long-term prognosis. Cytotoxic agents may also have a therapeutic role but are reserved for severe or unresponsive cases. Early recognition and treatment of Cogan syndrome is critical to prevent the rapid progression to vision loss, blindness, deafness, and death from systemic vasculitis. Early consultation with an otolaryngologist and rheumatologist for management is recommended.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Marginal Corneal Infiltrates</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The limbus plays an important role in immune-&#173;mediated corneal disorders. The limbus has a population of antigen-&#173;presenting cells (APCs) that constitutively express MHC class&#160;II antigens and are capable of efficient mobilization and induction of T-cell responses. Therefore, immune-&#173;related corneal changes often occur in a peripheral location adjacent to the limbus. In addition, because the peripheral cornea is adjacent to the vascularized (posterior) limbus, circulating immune cells, immune complexes, and complement factors tend to deposit adjacent to the terminal capillary loops of the limbal vascular arcades, thereby producing a variety of immune phenomena that manifest in the corneal periphery. Predisposing factors include</p>

			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Marginal infiltrates (also referred to as <span class="italic">catarrhal infiltrates</span>) are creamy white elliptical opacities typically separated from the limbus by a relatively lucent zone. They most often occur near the point of intersection of the eyelid margin and the limbus, that is, at 10, 2, 4 and 8&#160;o’clock (see Chapter&#160;3, Fig&#160;3-19). In chronic disease, superficial blood vessels may cross the clear interval into the area of corneal infiltration. The epithelium overlying marginal infiltrates may be intact, show punctate epithelial erosions, or be ulcerated. Stromal opacification, peripheral corneal thinning, and/or pannus may develop following resolution of the acute marginal infiltrates. The management of marginal infiltrates is discussed in Chapter&#160;3.</p>

			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Autoimmune peripheral keratitis may develop in patients who have systemic immune-&#173;mediated and rheumatic diseases. Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) occurs most often in association with rheumatoid arthritis but may also be seen in other conditions (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;11-3</span>). Biopsy of conjunctival tissue adjacent to marginal corneal disease—though not a standard diagnostic procedure—typically shows evidence of immune-&#173;mediated vaso-&#173;occlusive disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Central corneal melting in the setting of systemic collagen-&#173;vascular disease may be due to a different mechanism associated with a T-lymphocyte infiltration.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> A history of connective tissue disease is often (but not invariably) present, although in some patients the ocular finding of peripheral corneal infiltration or frank stromal melting may be the first sign of the underlying systemic illness. Autoimmune PUK generally correlates with exacerbations of systemic disease activity. Follow-&#173;up of patients with autoimmune PUK reveals that if they are treated inadequately, severe disease-&#173;related morbidity may occur in a high number of these patients. The term <span class="italic">keratolysis</span> refers to the significant (and often rapid) stromal melting seen in some cases of immune-&#173;mediated PUK associated with systemic autoimmunity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although autoimmune PUK can be bilateral and extensive, it is usually unilateral and limited to 1&#160;sector of the peripheral cornea (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-17</span>). The initial lesions appear in a zone within 2&#160;mm of the limbus and are accompanied by varying degrees of vaso-&#173;occlusion of the adjacent limbal vascular networks. In most cases, the epithelium is absent in the affected area and the underlying stroma thinned; however, if the disease is detected early, epithelial involvement may be patchy and the stroma still of near-&#173;normal thickness. Ulceration may or may not be associated with a significant cellular infiltrate in the corneal stroma, and the adjacent conjunctiva can be minimally or severely inflamed. The sclera can be involved in patients with systemic immune-&#173;mediated diseases (eg, necrotizing scleritis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis); careful, complete examination must be performed.</p>

			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="h5-head">management</span> The goal of therapy is to provide local supportive measures to decrease melting. This is achieved through maneuvers intended to promote epithelialization, improve wetting, and suppress immune-&#173;mediated inflammation both locally and systemically.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Maintaining enhanced lubrication of the ocular surface is very important, as many patients with rheumatoid arthritis have KCS as a manifestation of their secondary Sjögren syndrome and because lubrication may help diminish the effect of inflammatory cytokines in the tear film. Melting will stop or slow appreciably if the epithelium can be made to heal by means of lubricants, patching, or a bandage contact lens. A number of topical collagenase inhibitors (eg, sodium citrate 10%, acetylcysteine solution 20%, medroxyprogesterone 1%) and systemic collagenase inhibitors such as tetracyclines (eg, doxycycline) are of potential value. Topical cyclosporine has been shown to be effective in patients with central melting that is likely due to a T-cell–mediated process rather than occlusive vasculitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Topical corticosteroids, which also inhibit collagenase function, can have variable effects. In general, when considering steroids, the clinician must weigh the benefits of treating inflammation against the risks of impaired healing. Excision or recession of adjacent limbal conjunctiva (as has been advocated for Mooren ulcer; see the following section) is often followed by healing of the ulcer, presumably because the procedure eliminates a source of inflammatory cells and collagenolytic enzymes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Definitive management often cannot be achieved by local measures alone and requires institution or escalation of systemic treatment, including immunosuppression therapy with oral prednisone, cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide, or immunomodulatory agents such as methotrexate or cyclosporine. Biologic agents such as infliximab have reportedly been used with some success in more &#173;severe cases. Patients with severe, rapid melting may require intravenous therapy with high-dose cyclophosphamide, with or without corticosteroid therapy. Threatened perforation should be treated with temporizing measures such as cyanoacrylate glue and bandage contact lens placement until systemic therapy has been initiated, because lamellar and penetrating grafts are also susceptible to melting. Sometimes multiple tectonic grafts are required to preserve the globe while the systemic therapy is being adjusted. Once the underlying disease process has been controlled, keratoplasty for visual restoration can be performed (see Chapter&#160;15). Although conjunctival flaps can be very helpful in controlling the stromal melting in difficult-to-&#173;manage microbial keratitis, they are probably best avoided in immune-&#173;mediated disease. Bringing the conjunctival vasculature even closer to the area of corneal disease could accelerate melting. It is very important to partner with a rheumatologist in caring for patients with immune-&#173;mediated disease, as their risk of morbidity and death is significant.</p>

			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> By definition, Mooren ulcer is of unknown cause. PUK due to known local (eg, rosacea) or systemic (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) diseases should not be called Mooren ulcer. Evidence is mounting that autoimmunity plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Mooren ulcer, as the following have been found in patients with this condition:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-18">abnormal function of T-suppressor cells</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">A significant number of resident cells in Mooren ulcer specimens express MHC class&#160;II antigens, a reflection of the degree of immune-&#173;mediated inflammation in the tissue. It has been suggested that autoreactivity to a cornea-&#173;specific antigen may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder, and humoral and cell-&#173;mediated immune mechanisms may be involved in the initiation and perpetuation of corneal destruction. The proximity of the ulcerative lesion to the limbus probably has pathophysiologic importance (as discussed earlier, in the section on PUK), because resection or recession of the limbal conjunctiva can often have a beneficial therapeutic effect.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the cause of Mooren ulcer is unknown, precipitating factors include accidental trauma, surgery, or exposure to parasitic infection. The latter is of considerable importance, as the incidence of Mooren ulcer is particularly high in areas where parasitic (eg, helminthic) infections are endemic. The principal hypotheses are that inflammation associated with previous injury or infection may alter the expression of corneal or conjunctival antigens (to which autoantibodies are then produced) or that cross-&#173;reactivity occurs between the immune effectors generated in response to infection and corneal autoantigens. The simultaneous presence of multiple types of inflammatory cells, adhesion molecules, and costimulatory molecules in Mooren ulcer conjunctiva suggests that their interaction may contribute to a sustained immune activation as at least part of the pathogenic mechanism of this disorder.</p>

			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Mooren ulcer is a chronic, painful, progressive ulceration of the peripheral corneal stroma and epithelium. Typically, the ulcer starts in the periphery of the cornea and spreads circumferentially and then centripetally, with a leading undermined edge of deepithelialized tissue (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-18</span>). Slower ulceration proceeds toward the sclera. The eye is inflamed and pain can be intense, with photophobia and tearing. Perforation may occur with minor trauma or during secondary infection. Extensive vascularization and fibrosis of the cornea may occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some patients, it may be very difficult to differentiate Mooren ulcer from idiopathic PUK. An important distinguishing feature is the purely corneal involvement of Mooren ulcer; in PUK, the sclera is often involved.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Two clinical types of Mooren ulcer have been described. Unilateral Mooren ulcer typically occurs in an older patient population. Sex distribution is equal in this form, which is slowly progressive. A second type of Mooren ulcer is more common in Africa. This form is usually bilateral, rapidly progressive, and poorly responsive to medical or surgical intervention. Corneal ulceration (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-19</span>) and perforation are frequent. Many patients with this form of Mooren ulcer also have coexisting parasitemia. It is possible that in this subgroup of West African males, Mooren ulcer may be triggered by antigen–antibody reaction to helminthic toxins or antigens deposited in the limbal cornea during the blood-borne phase of parasitic infection. Hepatitis C should be considered in patients who pre&#173;sent with Mooren ulcer–like findings.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> The multitude of therapeutic strategies used against Mooren ulcer underscores the relative lack of effective treatment.

After other tissues had been transplanted, it was observed that corneas were rejected less frequently than other transplanted tissues. The concept that the cornea was a site of “immunologic privilege” and that corneal grafts were somehow protected from immunologic destruction subsequently emerged. Early immunologists attributed ocular immune privilege to “immunologic ignorance” due to the absence of lymphatics draining the anterior segment. It was later recognized that corneal grafts are not different from other tissue grafts and that the allogeneic cells of the transplant elicit an immune response, but the response is aberrant.

			<p class="body-text">For an immune response to occur, an antigenic substance is introduced and “recognized” (afferent arm; sensitization), resulting in the synthesis of specific antibody molecules and the appearance of effector lymphocytes that react specifically with the immunizing antigen (efferent arm; rejection). Although antibodies to foreign tissues are formed during graft rejection, they are not believed to be important in the usual type of allograft rejection. Rather, extensive evidence indicates that allograft rejection is associated with cellular immune mechanisms. Such T-lymphocyte–mediated responses are delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Other mechanisms are also probably involved. For the endothelial cells to be rejected, they must express MHC class&#160;II antigens.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Angiogenesis and Lymphangiogenesis in the Cornea</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Though not normally present in the cornea, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels may extend into the cornea—as sprouts of the vascular endothelium from the limbal tissue—after inflammatory, infectious, traumatic, chemical, or toxic insults. Inflammatory cells infiltrate tissue at local sites of vascular remodeling, where they secrete proangiogenic factors and metalloproteinases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is upregulated in inflamed and vascularized corneas in humans and in animal models.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Targeting angiogenesis in order to modulate immune responses after corneal transplant has been the primary area of interest for many researchers. Treatment of corneal neovascularization after corneal transplant may limit both the afferent and efferent arms of alloimmunity and thus reduce the tendency toward inflammatory reactions, which can jeopardize graft survival. VEGF inhibitors, including ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept, are used to treat neovascular age-&#173;related macular degeneration. The efficacy of these antiangiogenic therapies, which are administered topically and subconjunctivally after transplantation, has been demonstrated. Novel antiangiogenic “t” molecules, which target the intracellular pathways of angiogenesis (small interfering RNA, antisense oligonucleotides), have been reported to provide a promising alternative.</p>
			<p class="body-text">VEGF-C induces lymphangiogenesis in various animal models. Lymphatics transport APCs to regional lymphoid tissue, where the APCs initiate the T-cell response. The growth of new lymphatic vessels thus facilitates access of donor and host APCs and antigenic material to regional lymph nodes, accelerating sensitization to graft antigens. Recently, the targeting of lymphangiogenesis has also become a focused area of research. There is evidence that blocking lymphatic vessels may play a key role in the prevention and treatment of corneal graft rejection.</p>

			<div id="Chapt11_Top6">
			<p class="h2-h1">Episcleritis</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1 body-text--no-indent-"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Episcleritis is a generally benign inflammation of the episcleral tissues. An underlying systemic cause is found in only a minority of patients.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Episcleritis is typically a transient (usually days to weeks), self-&#173;limited disease of sudden onset affecting adults aged 20–50&#160;years, with most cases occurring in women. The patient’s chief concern is usually ocular redness with irritation or pain. Slight tenderness may occur. The disease occurs most often in the exposed interpalpebral zone of the eye, in the area of a pinguecula. It may recur in the same or different locations. About one-third of patients have bilateral disease at one time or another.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Episcleritis is classified as simple (diffuse injection) or nodular. In simple episcleritis, the inflammation is localized to a sector of the globe in 70% of cases and to the entire episclera in 30% of cases. A localized mobile nodule develops in nodular episcleritis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-20</span>). Small peripheral corneal opacities can be observed adjacent to an area of episcleral inflammation in 10% of patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Episcleral inflammation is superficial and will blanch with application of topical phenylephrine 2.5%. Episcleritis must be differentiated from the deeper inflammation seen in scleritis (often with associated scleral edema clearly discernible on slit-lamp examination). The inflamed episclera is characteristically bright red or salmon pink in natural light, unlike the violaceous hue seen in most forms of scleritis.</p>
			<p class="reference-single--no-space- ParaOverride-7">Sainz de la Maza M, Molina N, Gonzalez-&#173;Gonzalez LA, Doctor PP, Tauber J, Foster CS. Clinical characteristics of a large cohort of patients with scleritis and episcleritis. <span class="italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2012;119(1):43–50.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> A workup for underlying causes (eg, autoimmune connective tissue disease such as Sjögren syndrome or rheumatoid arthritis; other conditions such as gout, herpes zoster, syphilis, tuberculosis, Lyme disease, or rosacea) is rarely indicated except after multiple recurrences. Episcleritis generally clears without treatment, but topical or oral NSAIDs may be prescribed for patients bothered by the pain. Most patients simply need reassurance that their condition is not sight threatening and can be treated with lubricants alone. Topical corticosteroid use should be kept to a minimum in this benign, self-&#173;limited condition. In cases that do not respond to lubricants and NSAIDs, a course of topical corticosteroids may be necessary and beneficial.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Scleritis</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> A much more severe ocular inflammatory condition than episcleritis, scleritis is caused by an immune-&#173;mediated (typically immune-&#173;complex) vasculitis that frequently leads to destruction of the sclera. Scleritis is often associated with an underlying systemic immunologic disease; about one-third of patients with diffuse or nodular scleritis and two-thirds of patients with necrotizing scleritis have a detectable connective tissue or auto&#173;immune disease; the different forms of scleritis are discussed in the following subsections.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Scleritis occurs most often in the fourth to sixth decades of life, is more common in women, and is exceedingly rare in children. About one-half of scleritis cases are bilateral at some time in their course. The onset of scleritis is usually gradual, extending over several days. Most patients with scleritis experience severe boring ocular pain, which may worsen at night and occasionally awaken them from sleep. The pain may be referred to other regions of the head or face on the involved side, and the globe is often tender. The inflamed sclera has a violaceous hue, which is best seen in sunlight. Inflamed scleral vessels have a crisscross pattern, adhere to the sclera, and cannot be moved with a cotton-&#173;tipped applicator. Scleral edema, often with overlying episcleral edema, is noted by slit-lamp examination. Scleritis may lead to structural alterations of the globe, with attendant visual morbidity. Scleritis can be classified clinically based on the anatomical location (anterior versus posterior sclera) and appearance of the scleral inflammation (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;11-4</span>). See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for histologic correlation.</p>
			<p class="reference-single--no-space- ParaOverride-7">Sainz de la Maza M, Molina N, Gonzalez-Gonzalez LA, Doctor PP, Tauber J, Foster CS. Clinical characteristics of a large cohort of patients with scleritis and episcleritis. <span class="italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2012;119(1):43–50.</p>
			<p class="h3">Diffuse versus nodular anterior scleritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Diffuse anterior scleritis</span> is characterized by a zone of scleral edema and redness. A part of the anterior sclera (&lt;50%) is involved in 60% of cases; the entire anterior segment, in 40% (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-21</span>). In <span class="italic">nodular anterior scleritis,</span> the scleral nodule is a deep violaceous color, immobile, and separated from the overlying episcleral tissue, which is raised by the nodule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-22</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-16">Necrotizing scleritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Necrotizing scleritis is the most destructive form of scleritis. Ocular and systemic complications develop in 60% of affected patients, vision loss occurs in 40%, and a significant minority may die prematurely because of complications of vasculitis.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Necrotizing scleritis with inflammation</span> Patients with necrotizing scleritis with inflammation typically present with severe pain. Most commonly, a localized patch of inflammation is noted initially, with the edges of the lesion more inflamed than the center. In more advanced disease (25% of cases), an avascular edematous patch of sclera is seen (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-23</span>). Untreated, necrotizing scleritis may spread posteriorly to the equator and circumferentially until the entire anterior globe is involved. Severe tissue loss may result if treatment is not intensive and prompt. The sclera may develop a blue-gray appearance (due to thinning, which allows the underlying choroid to show) and reveal an altered deep episcleral blood vessel pattern (large anastomotic blood vessels that may circumscribe the involved area) after the inflammation subsides.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h4-head">Necrotizing scleritis without inflammation</span> Though undoubtedly due to inflammation, this form of scleritis (also known as <span class="italic">scleromalacia perforans</span>) is said to be “without inflammation” because its clinical presentation is distinct from that of other forms of anterior scleritis, in which typical signs (redness, edema) and symptoms (pain) of inflammation are readily apparent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Scleromalacia perforans typically occurs in patients with long-&#173;standing rheumatoid arthritis. Signs of inflammation are minimal, and this type of scleritis is generally painless. As the disease progresses, the sclera thins and the underlying dark uveal tissue becomes visible (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-24</span>). In many cases, the uvea is covered with only thin connective tissue and conjunctiva. Large abnormal blood vessels surround and cross the areas of scleral loss. A bulging staphyloma develops if intraocular pressure is elevated; spontaneous perforation is rare, although these eyes may rupture with minimal trauma.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Posterior scleritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Posterior scleritis can occur in isolation or concomitantly with anterior scleritis. Some investigators include posterior scleritis as an anterior variant of inflammatory pseudotumor. Patients present with pain, tenderness, proptosis, vision loss, and, occasionally, restricted motility. Choroidal folds, exudative retinal detachment, papilledema, and angle-&#173;closure glaucoma secondary to choroidal thickening may develop. Retraction of the lower eyelid may occur in upgaze, presumably caused by infiltration of muscles in the region of the posterior scleritis. The pain may be referred to other parts of the head, and the diagnosis can be missed in the absence of associated anterior scleritis. Demonstration of thickened posterior sclera by echography (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-25</span>), computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Often, no related systemic disease can be found in patients with posterior scleritis.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Complications of scleritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complications of scleritis are frequent and include peripheral keratitis (occurring in 37% of cases), scleral thinning (33%), uveitis (30%), glaucoma (18%), and cataract (7%). In sclerokeratitis, the peripheral cornea becomes opacified by fibrosis and lipid deposition in conjunction with neighboring scleritis (which may be severe or very mild; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-26</span>). With progression, the central cornea becomes involved, resulting in opacification of a large segment of cornea. This type of keratitis commonly accompanies herpes zoster scleritis but may also occur in rheumatic diseases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anterior uveitis may occur as a spillover phenomenon in eyes with anterior scleritis. Some degree of posterior uveitis occurs in all patients with posterior scleritis and may also occur in anterior scleritis. Although one-third of patients with scleritis have evidence of scleral translucency and/or thinning, frank scleral defects are seen only in the most severe forms of necrotizing disease and in the late stages of scleromalacia perforans.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Scleritis can occur in association with various systemic infectious diseases, including syphilis, tuberculosis, herpes zoster, Lyme disease, “cat-scratch” disease, and leprosy (Hansen disease). It is most frequently seen, however, in association with autoimmune or connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and seronegative spondyloarthropathies (eg, ankylosing spondylitis) or secondary to vasculitides such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis), polyarteritis nodosa, and giant cell arteritis. Metabolic diseases such as gout may also, in rare instances, be associated with scleritis. More than 50% of patients with scleritis have an identifiable associated systemic disease. The differential diagnosis of scleritis is similar to that of PUK (see Table&#160;11-3).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The workup of scleritis should therefore include a complete physical examination, with attention to the joints, skin, and cardiovascular and respiratory systems. It is recommended that the ophthalmologist consult with a rheumatologist or other internist with experience in diagnosing and managing these conditions. Laboratory studies should always be guided by the history and findings of the physical examination. However, the laboratory tests listed in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;11-5</span> are generally recommended as an initial screening.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Although topical corticosteroids can be used to alleviate symptoms, the treatment of scleritis is systemic. A guideline for the treatment of patients with scleritis has been proposed by Sainz de la Maza et al and is shown in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;11-27</span>. It is important to clearly define treatment goals: treatment failure may be defined as progression of disease to a more severe form (eg, nodular to necrotizing) or failure to achieve response to treatment after 2–3&#160;weeks of therapy, in which case an alternate therapeutic strategy will need to be instituted. Idiopathic diffuse and nodular forms of scleritis, which have no ocular complications and little scleral inflammation, may be responsive to treatment with oral NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen, indomethacin). If one NSAID is not effective, another may be tried; only one NSAID should be prescribed at a time. Systemic corticosteroid treatment may be used if the patient is unresponsive to NSAIDs or inflammation is more severe; NSAIDs and steroids should not be given simultaneously. Prednisone may be started at 1&#160;mg/kg daily and then tapered within the first 2&#160;weeks of treatment. Remission may be maintained with NSAIDs. Gastroprotective medication should be given to patients prescribed NSAIDs or steroids.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If corticosteroid treatment fails or the patient relapses after tapering the steroid, immunosuppression therapy may be considered. These cases often respond to antimetabolites (eg, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil). Immunosuppression treatment (eg, antimetabolites; T-cell inhibitors such as cyclosporin&#160;A or tacrolimus; alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide) or biologic response modifiers (eg, anti-&#173;TNF-<span class="greek--tx-">a</span> medications such as infliximab; anti-&#173;CD20 agents such as rituximab) are usually necessary in patients with associated systemic disease, necrotizing scleritis, and/or progressive destructive ocular lesions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients receiving systemic treatment must be monitored closely by a physician specially trained in the administration of these medications and in the early detection and management of their complications. In addition, they should be informed that close follow-&#173;up with the ophthalmologist and partnering providers is necessary to monitor their disease status and treatment. Antituberculosis and anti-&#173;<span class="italic">Pneumocysti</span>s coverage may be necessary for at-risk patients. In patients whose systemic evaluation is initially negative, it is important to repeat the workup annually.</p>
