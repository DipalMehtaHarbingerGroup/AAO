			<p class="h2-h1">Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The slit lamp is a fundamental and invaluable tool in the ophthalmologist’s armamentarium. Mastery of the slit-lamp examination is critical in categorizing corneal pathology and formulating a diagnostic (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-1</span>) and therapeutic plan.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The slit-lamp biomicroscope has 2&#160;rotating arms—one for the slit illuminator and the other for the biomicroscope—mounted on a common axis. The illumination unit is essentially a projector with a light beam that is adjustable in width, height, direction, intensity, and color. The biomicroscope is a binocular Galilean telescope that offers a choice of magnifications. The illumination and microscope arms are parfocal, arranged so that both focus on the same spot, with the slit beam centered on the field of view. This setup provides direct illumination, and purposeful shifting of alignment allows for indirect illumination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Four reflections of light can be seen when the eye is examined with the slit lamp. These reflections are known as Purkinje images or reflexes, named after the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyně. The first Purkinje image is reflection off the surface of the cornea. The second is from the inner surface of the cornea. The third and fourth are from the anterior and posterior surfaces of the lens, respectively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The slit lamp allows clinicians to examine the eye in a variety of ways, as described in the discussions that follow.</p>
			<p class="h3">Direct illumination methods</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Diffuse illumination</span> With diffuse illumination, the light beam is broadened, reduced in intensity, and directed at the eye from an oblique angle. Swinging the illuminator arm to produce highlights and shadows can enhance the visibility of raised lesions of the ocular surface and iris (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Focal illumination</span> With focal illumination, the light and the microscope are focused on the same spot, and the slit aperture is adjusted from wide to narrow. Broad-beam illumination, which uses a beam width of about 3&#160;mm, is optimal for visualizing eyelid lesions as well as the corneal opacities seen in dystrophies or scarring. Slit-beam illumination, which uses a beam width of about 1&#160;mm or less, gives an optical section of the cornea (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-3</span>); this section is essential for evaluation of corneal thinning, edema, stromal infiltrates, and endothelial abnormalities. The examiner can use a very narrow slit beam to help identify differences in refractive index between transparent structures as light rays pass through the cornea, anterior chamber, and lens. The examiner can also reduce the height of a narrow beam to determine the presence and amount of cell and flare in the anterior chamber.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Specular reflection</span> Specular reflections are normal light reflexes bouncing off a surface (see Fig&#160;2-2B). An example is the bright round or oval spot seen reflected from the ocular surface in a typical flash photograph of an eye. These mirror images of the light source can be annoying, and it is tempting to ignore them during slit-lamp examination. However, the clarity and sharpness of these reflections from the tear film give clues to the condition of the underlying tissue.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A faint reflection also comes from the posterior corneal surface. The examiner can enhance this specular reflection by placing a light beam at an appropriate angle, revealing the corneal endothelium. Following are the steps for examining the corneal endothelium with specular reflection:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">&#9;1.&#9;Begin by setting the slit-beam arm at an angle of 60° from the viewing arm and using a short slit or 0.2-mm spot.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;2.&#9;Identify the very bright mirror image of the lightbulb’s filament and the paired epithelial and endothelial Purkinje light reflexes.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;3.&#9;Superimpose the corneal endothelial light reflex onto the filament’s mirror image, giving a bright glare.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-4">&#9;4.&#9;Use the joystick to move the biomicroscope slightly forward in order to focus the endothelial reflex.</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Specular reflection is monocular, and 1&#160;eyepiece may require focusing. A setting of 25<span class="CharOverride-1">×</span> to 40<span class="CharOverride-1">×</span> is usually necessary to obtain a clear view of the endothelial mosaic. Cell density and morphology are noted (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-4</span>); guttae and keratic precipitates appear as nonreflective dark areas.</p>
			<p class="h3">Indirect illumination methods</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Proximal illumination</span> Turning a knob on the illumination arm slightly decenters the light beam from its isocentric position, causing the light beam and the microscope to be focused at different but adjacent spots. This technique, proximal illumination, highlights an existing opacity against deeper tissue layers and allows the examiner to see small irregularities that have a refractive index similar to that of their surroundings. Moving the light beam back and forth in small oscillations can help the examiner detect small 3-dimensional lesions, such as a corneal foreign body.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Sclerotic scatter</span> Total internal reflection in the cornea makes possible another form of indirect illumination, sclerotic scatter. (See BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics,</span> for a discussion of total internal reflection.) Decentering the isocentric light beam so that an intense beam shines on the limbus and scatters off the sclera causes a very faint glow of the cornea (see Fig&#160;2-2C). Reflective opacities stand out against the dark field, whereas areas of reduced light transmission in the cornea are seen as shades of gray. This technique is effective in demonstrating epithelial edema, mild stromal infiltration, nebulae, and cornea verticillata.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Retroillumination</span> Retroillumination can be used to examine more than one area of the eye. Retroillumination from the iris is performed by displacing the beam tangentially while examining the cornea (see Fig&#160;2-2D). Through observing the zone between the light and dark backgrounds, the examiner can detect subtle corneal abnormalities. Retroillumination from the fundus is performed by aligning the light beam nearly parallel with the examiner’s visual axis and rotating the light so that it shines through the edge of the pupil. Opacities in the cornea, phakic or pseudophakic lens, or posterior capsule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-5</span>) are highlighted against the red reflex, and iris defects can be transilluminated.</p>

			<p class="h3">Clinical use</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The slit-lamp examination should be performed in an orderly fashion, beginning with direct illumination of the eyelids (margin, meibomian glands, and eyelashes), conjunctiva, and sclera. A broad beam illuminates the cornea and overlying tear film in the optical section. Details are examined with a narrow beam. The examiner estimates the height of the tear meniscus and looks for mucin cells and other debris in the tear film. Discrete lesions are measured with a slit-beam micrometer or an eyepiece reticule. All indirect illumination methods, including retroillumination, accentuate fine changes. The examiner then uses specular reflection to inspect the endothelium and has the patient shift gaze in different directions so that each corneal quadrant can be surveyed. A slit beam is used to estimate the thickness of the cornea and the depth of the anterior chamber. A short beam or spot will show flare or cells in the aqueous humor. Direct and indirect illumination and retroillumination techniques are used to identify abnormalities of the iris and lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With all illumination methods, the examiner actively controls the light beam to sweep across the eye, using shadows and reflections to bring out details. Having the patient blink can help the examiner distinguish ocular surface changes from tiny opacities floating in the tear film. After initial low-power screening, much of the slit-lamp examination is performed using higher magnifications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Visualization of deeper and peripheral intraocular structures, except for the anterior vitreous humor, requires special lenses. A contact lens allows examination of the intermediate and posterior portions of the eye; its use is often combined with angled mirrors and prisms for gonioscopy and peripheral fundus examination.</p>

			<p class="h1">Scanning</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Ultrasound Biomicroscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">High-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) provides high-&#173;resolution in vivo imaging of the anterior segment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-6</span>). Tissues visualized include the cornea, the anterior and posterior surface of the iris, the ciliary body, zonular fibers, angle structures, and the anterior lens capsule. UBM technology incorporates 50–100-MHz transducers into a B-mode clinical scanner. Paradigm Medical Industries (Salt Lake City, UT) and Ophthalmic Technologies (Toronto, ON, Canada) UBM scanners utilize 50-MHz transducers and provide axial and lateral physical resolutions of 25&#160;µm and 50&#160;µm, respectively. UBM allows structures to be viewed through an opaque cornea and total hyphema. The scleral spur, located where the trabecular meshwork meets an interface line between the sclera and ciliary body, is a constant landmark that aids the clinician in the examination of various angle configurations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">UBM is a helpful adjunct in the assessment of ciliary body pathology, including cysts and tumors. It is also very useful in the evaluation of various angle anomalies, including angle recession, occludable angles, pupillary block, plateau iris, malignant glaucoma, and cyclodialysis clefts. In addition, clinicians can use UBM to assist with accurate placement of phakic intraocular lenses (IOLs), identify pigment dispersion syndrome, and locate IOL haptic positions and foreign bodies in the angle. Its major advantage is its ability to visualize structures behind the iris; most of its other capabilities in visualizing the anterior segment have been supplanted by anterior segment optical coherence tomography.</p>

			<p class="h2">Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive technology that produces <br />2-dimensional, high-&#173;resolution, and high-&#173;definition cross-&#173;sectional images of ocular tissue. These images are similar to ultrasonographic images, but they are based on the emission and reflection of light (low-&#173;coherence interferometry). The extremely fine resolution of the images (5–10&#160;µm) allows exquisite delineation of the layers of the cornea, anterior chamber, and iris. There are 2&#160;types of anterior segment OCT: time-&#173;domain (TD-OCT) and frequency-&#173;domain (FD-OCT). Spectral-&#173;domain OCT (SD-OCT), also called Fourier-&#173;domain OCT, is a subtype of the latter. A new, faster OCT technique that features components of both TD- and SD-OCT, called swept-source OCT, has been developed; it is being used both in the clinical setting and in real time in the operating room as an attachment to the operating microscope.</p>
			<p class="body-text">OCT scans can measure the depth, width, and angle of the anterior chamber (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-7</span>). The corneal pachymetry feature of these devices is useful in the preoperative evaluation of patients with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy. In postoperative follow-&#173;up of endothelial keratoplasty cases, the shape, thickness, and attachment of the donor lenticule can be visualized and quantified. In patients who have undergone laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), clinicians can use OCT to measure the thickness of the corneal flap and the residual stromal bed to determine the safety of an enhancement (re-&#173;treatment). Recent software provides information on corneal curvature and epithelial thickness that is helpful in screening refractive surgery patients. Software is also available to calculate the true corneal power, which can be used in IOL power calculation after LASIK or photorefractive keratectomy. Intraoperative OCT has also recently been developed as an adjunct in Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) to ensure correct orientation of endothelial grafts.</p>

			<p class="h2">Specular Microscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Specular microscopy (contact and noncontact techniques) provides an objective measurement of corneal endothelial cells. The following parameters can be calculated from a specular or confocal image:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-7"><span class="italic">Density.</span> Endothelial cell density decreases with age. The endothelial cell count normally exceeds 3500&#160;cells/mm<span class="CharOverride-2">2</span> in children and gradually declines with age to approximately 2000&#160;cells/mm<span class="CharOverride-2">2</span> in older individuals. An average value for adults is 2400&#160;cells/mm<span class="CharOverride-2">2</span> (with a range of 1500–3500&#160;cells/mm<span class="CharOverride-2">2</span>), with a mean cell size of 150–350&#160;µm<span class="CharOverride-2">2</span>. Low cell density (ie, fewer than 1000&#160;cells/mm<span class="CharOverride-2">2</span>) may provide for a transparent cornea, but such corneas are at greater risk for corneal decompensation with intraocular surgery.

			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Confocal Microscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Confocal corneal microscopy is a noninvasive technique for in vivo imaging of the living cornea; it compares to in vitro histochemical analysis of the 5&#160;layers of the cornea. The basic principle of confocal microscopy is that a single point of tissue can be illuminated by a point source of light or laser and simultaneously imaged by a camera in the same plane (ie, confocal). Because this technique involves scanning a small region of tissue with thousands of spots of light, it produces a usable field of view at a cellular level and an image of very high resolution. A number of units are available for clinical use: (1)&#160;tandem scanning, (2)&#160;scanning-&#173;slit, and (3)&#160;laser scanning confocal microscopes. The major advantage of laser scanning confocal systems is the ability to serially produce extremely thin images of the cornea. The depth of focus is 7–9&#160;µm in tandem scanning, 26&#160;µm in slit scanning, and 5–7&#160;µm in laser scanning.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Confocal microscopy is useful in identifying causative organisms in cases of infectious keratitis, such as <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis, fungal keratitis, microsporidiosis, and herpetic eye disease. It is also helpful in evaluating corneal nerve morphology in diabetic neurotrophic keratitis and neuropathic pain occurring in ocular surface disease and after refractive surgery (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-9</span>); it is similarly useful in evaluating the corneal endothelial layer. In addition, confocal microscopy may help differentiate some corneal dystrophies, for example, Reis-&#173;Bücklers corneal dystrophy from Thiel-&#173;Behnke corneal dystrophy, both of which involve the Bowman layer, as well as Fuchs and posterior polymorphous dystrophies, both of which involve the corneal endothelium (see Chapter&#160;7, Figs&#160;7-6A and&#160;7-7A).</p>

			<p class="h1">Evaluation of Corneal Curvature</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Zones of the Cornea</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For more than 100&#160;years, the corneal shape has been known to be aspheric. Typically, the central cornea is about 3&#160;diopters&#160;(D) steeper than the periphery, a positive shape factor <span class="italic">(prolate).</span> Clinically, the cornea may be divided into zones (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-10</span>). The <span class="italic">central zone</span> is 1–3&#160;mm in diameter and closely resembles a spherical surface. It is surrounded by the <span class="italic">paracentral zone,</span> a 3- to 4-mm “doughnut” with an outer diameter of 7–8&#160;mm that progressively flattens from the center. Together, the paracentral and central zones constitute the <span class="italic">apical zone,</span> which is used in contact lens fitting. The central and paracentral zones are primarily responsible for the refractive power of the cornea. Adjacent to the paracentral zone is the <span class="italic">peripheral zone</span> or <span class="italic">transitional zone,</span> which has an outer diameter of approximately 11&#160;mm. This is the area of greatest flattening and asphericity in the normal cornea. Finally, there is the limbus <span class="italic">(limbal zone),</span> where the cornea steepens prior to joining the sclera at the limbal sulcus; its outer diameter averages 12&#160;mm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">optical zone</span> is the portion of the cornea that overlies the entrance pupil of the iris. The <span class="italic">corneal apex</span> is the point of maximum curvature, typically temporal to the center of the pupil. The <span class="italic">corneal vertex</span> is the point located at the intersection of the patient’s line of fixation and the corneal surface. It is represented by the corneal light reflex when the cornea is illuminated coaxially with fixation. The corneal vertex is the center of the keratoscopic image and does not necessarily correspond to the point of maximum curvature at the corneal apex (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-11</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Shape, Curvature, and Power</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Three topographic properties of the cornea are important to its optical function: the underlying <span class="italic">shape,</span> which determines its <span class="italic">curvature</span> and, hence, its refractive <span class="italic">power.</span> Shape and curvature are geometric properties of the cornea, whereas power is a functional property. Historically, power was the first parameter of the cornea to be described, and a unit representing the refractive power of the central cornea, the <span class="italic">diopter,</span> was accepted as its basic unit of measurement. However, with the advent of contact lenses and refractive surgery, knowing the overall shape and the related property of curvature has become increasingly important.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The refractive power of the cornea is determined by <span class="italic">Snell’s law,</span> the law of refraction. Snell’s law is based on the difference between 2&#160;refractive indices (in this case, of the cornea and of air), divided by the radius of curvature. The refractive index of air is 1.000; aqueous and tears, 1.336; and corneal stroma, 1.376. Although the air–tear film interface constitutes the primary refractive element of the eye, the difference between total corneal power calculated based on stroma alone and corneal power calculated with both stroma and tears is only –0.060, a clinically insignificant difference.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Calculating the anterior corneal power using the refractive indices overestimates the true power because it does not take into account the negative contribution of the posterior cornea. Average refractive power of the central cornea is about +43&#160;D, which is the sum of the refractive power at the air–stroma interface of +49&#160;D minus the endothelium–aqueous power of 6&#160;D. For most clinical purposes, a derived corneal refractive index of 1.3375 is used in calculating central corneal power. This value was chosen to allow +45&#160;D to equate to a 7.5-mm radius of curvature. BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics,</span> covers these topics in greater depth.</p>

			<p class="h2">Keratometry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ophthalmometer (keratometer) was invented by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1853. It empirically estimates, but does not directly measure, the central corneal power. It reads 2&#160;points in the 2.8- to 4.0-mm zone. A simple vergence formula used in computing the corneal power in this region is then utilized to calculate the radius of curvature. Results are reported as <span class="italic">radius of curvature</span> in millimeters or <span class="italic">refracting power</span> in diopters.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The 2&#160;basic keratometers are the Helmholtz type and the Javal-&#173;Schiøtz type. The former is more commonly used. The Helmholtz type is a 1-position device in which the image size is adjustable; the examiner aligns the “plus sign” and “minus sign” mires (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-12</span>). The Javal-&#173;Schiøtz type is a 2-position instrument in which the object size is adjustable; the examiner aligns mires resembling a red square and a green staircase.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The manual keratometer has certain limitations. It measures only a small region of the cornea without providing information about the cornea central or peripheral to these points. Keratometry assumes that the cornea has a symmetric spherocylindrical shape with a major and minor axis separated by 90°. It also does not account for spherical aberration, and it is susceptible to focusing and misalignment errors. Finally, if the cornea is irregular, distortion of the mires reduces the accuracy of the measurement.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Despite these drawbacks, the manual keratometer provides accurate information for most patients. It is a valuable instrument in ophthalmology for measuring astigmatism. Clinically, corneal curvature data are used primarily for contact lens fitting, IOL calculations, and planning for corneal refractive surgery. However, it is not accurate for IOL power calculations in patients who have undergone previous corneal refractive surgery. It is also helpful for detecting irregular astigmatism, which is visible as distortion or irregularity in the appearance of the mires. Clinicians can also use the keratometer dynamically by comparing the measurements in primary gaze with those in upgaze. Steepening of the measurements in upgaze is an early sign of keratoconus.</p>
			<p class="h2">Keratoscopy and Placido Disk–based Topography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The keratoscope, which is based on the original prototype invented by Antonio Plácido da Costa in 1880 (Placido disk), projects circular, concentric, illuminated mires onto the corneal surface. Unlike keratometry, which measures quantitative data and is limited to the central 4.0&#160;mm, keratoscopy provides a qualitative evaluation of a larger surface of the cornea, based on the shape and dimension of and the distance between the projected rings. It is helpful in the detection of paracentral and peripheral disorders of corneal contour, such as keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, and astigmatism following penetrating keratoplasty (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-13</span>). In addition, distorted mires can aid clinicians in identifying surface irregularity.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Topography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal topography is based on the Placido disk principle of reflecting images of multiple concentric rings onto the cornea; in corneal topography, the projected images are digitally captured and analyzed by computer software. Generally, in steeper parts of the cornea, the reflected mires appear closer together and thinner and the axis of the central mire is shorter. Conversely, along the flat axis, the mires are farther apart and thicker and the central mire is longer. Thousands of points are measured, and, using complex algorithms, the software generates color-&#173;coded maps of the topographic curvature of the cornea. These topographers assess only the anterior corneal surface and tear film.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There are 3&#160;types of maps. The first is the <span class="italic">axial curvature map,</span> which closely approximates the power of the central 1–2&#160;mm of the cornea but fails to describe the true shape and power of the peripheral cornea. The second is a <span class="italic">tangential map,</span> which typically shows better sensitivity to peripheral changes, with less “smoothing” of the curvature than the axial map (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-14</span>). (In these maps, diopters are relative units of curvature and do not equate to diopters of corneal power.) A third map, the <span class="italic">mean curvature map,</span> uses an infinite number of spheres to fit the curvature. The algorithm determines a minimum- and maximum-&#173;size best-fit sphere and, from the radius of each, determines an average curvature (arithmetic mean of the principal curvatures) known as the mean curvature. These powers are then mapped using standard colors to represent diopter changes, allowing for more sensitivity to peripheral changes of curvature (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-15</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Before any topographic maps are interpreted, the color scale needs to be evaluated, because it can grossly influence the interpretation of the map. Arranging the color bar in 0.50-D increments may improve accuracy in interpretation of the map. Smaller increments greatly exaggerate minor or normal changes and increase sensitivity. Larger increments decrease sensitivity and can mask significant changes. The absolute scale is constant for all examinations and is useful for comparisons over time and between patients. The normalized or relative scale adjusts to the range of powers on the corneal surface and differs for each cornea. Thus, the power range and step size may be narrow or broad, thereby magnifying or minifying significant changes. Besides the limitations of the algorithms and the variations in terminology used by manufacturers, various other problems may affect the accuracy of corneal topography:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">misalignment</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">limited stability (test-to-test variation)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">sensitivity to focus errors</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">tear film effects</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">distortions</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">limited area of coverage (central and limbal)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">no standardized data maps</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Despite these limitations, corneal topography maps allow clinicians to detect forme fruste and frank keratoconus in refractive surgery screenings and identify and predict corneal ectasia following refractive surgery. A normal astigmatic profile has a symmetric bow-tie pattern (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-16</span>). Keratoconus can be represented by a central cone or inferotemporal steepening (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-17</span>) (see Chapter&#160;7 for a discussion of keratoconus). Skew deviations and asymmetric bow ties associated with focal steepening inferiorly are also suggestive of keratoconus. The ratio between the inferior and superior keratometry values can be indicative of keratoconus. The inferior–superior value (I–S value) is derived by calculating the difference between inferior and superior corneal curvature measurements at a defined set of 5&#160;points above and below the horizontal meridian. I–S values greater than 1.4 and central corneal powers greater than 47.2&#160;D are all suggestive of corneal ectatic disorders, but there is some overlap between normal and abnormal eyes (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;2-1</span>). Pellucid marginal degeneration has a characteristic “crab-claw” configuration with against-&#173;the-rule astigmatism (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-18</span>). However, this pattern is not pathognomonic, as it can also be seen in keratoconus. Corneal topography can aid in accurately monitoring progression of these ectatic corneal diseases and in planning procedures such as corneal crosslinking. Prior refractive surgery leads to central flattening in myopic corrections and steepening in hyperopic corrections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal mapping is useful in managing congenital and postoperative astigmatism, particularly following penetrating keratoplasty. Complex peripheral patterns may result in a refractive axis of astigmatism that is not aligned with a topographic axis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to displaying power maps, computerized topography systems may display other data: pupil size and location, indices estimating degrees of regular and irregular astigmatism, estimates of the probability that the patient has keratoconus, simulated corneal curvature measurements, wavefront analysis, results of dry eye screening, meibomian gland imagery, and chord µ (angle kappa).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Angle kappa,</span> the angle formed between the visual axis and the optical (or pupillary) axis, is particularly useful in the selection of basic or premium IOLs for cataract surgery and in detailed planning of astigmatic correction. Generally, an angle kappa less than 0.4&#160;mm is desired. If angle kappa is greater than 0.4&#160;mm, the clinician may choose to avoid multifocal IOLs. The ideal amount of spherical aberrations varies by individual, and appropriate IOL selection might offset these aberrations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal mapping can also be useful in the selection of lens implants for patients with previous refractive surgery who are considering cataract surgery. Hyperopic ablation induces negative spherical aberrations because the central cornea is steeper, and myopic ablation induces positive spherical aberrations because the central cornea is flattened. To avoid halos in eyes with positive aberrations, the clinician may consider an IOL with negative or zero spherical aberrations.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Tomography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Placido disk–based topography describes only the surface corneal curvature (power), whereas corneal tomography computes a 3-dimensional image of the cornea, providing details such as the anterior and posterior corneal curvature, corneal thickness, and anterior chamber depth, as well as information on the iris and lens. Various technologies, including scanning-&#173;slit and Scheimpflug imaging, are utilized to obtain these images.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Scanning-slit technology has been combined with Placido disk–based topography; this combination of technologies derives its posterior elevation map mathematically. This map may overestimate the posterior corneal curvature, however, especially in patients who have undergone LASIK procedures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other systems are based on the Scheimpflug principle, which is a geometric rule that describes the orientation of the plane of focus of an optical system, such as a camera, when the lens plane is not parallel to the image plane. The principle is named after Austrian army captain Theodor Scheimpflug, who used it to devise an apparatus for correcting perspective distortion in aerial photography. In Scheimpflug-&#173;based corneal tomography, a thin layer of the cornea is illuminated with the slit. Because they are not entirely transparent, the cells scatter the light, creating a sectional image. This image is photographed according to the Scheimpflug principle, resulting in an image of the illuminated plane in complete focus from the anterior surface of the cornea to the posterior surface of the crystalline lens. A number of devices have employed the Scheimpflug principle with rotational scanning, dual rotational scanning, and Placido disk–based topography.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Scheimpflug-based systems present considerable information, including anterior curvature, corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, anterior and posterior elevation, and pupil diameter. As a result, the thickness and topography of the entire anterior and posterior surface of the cornea can be displayed (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-19</span>). In addition, a densitometry function measures the amount of corneal or lens opacification.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal tomography systems also employ keratoconus detection and classification algorithms. In keratoconus suspects, corneal tomography may provide additional useful information, as it may reveal subtle changes in the posterior corneal curvature that can precede anterior steepening. Measurements of the posterior corneal curvature and thickness provide important confirmation of thinning and steepening (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-20</span>).</p>

			<div id="Chapt2_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Ocular Surface Staining</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Fluorescein</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topical fluorescein is a nontoxic, water-&#173;soluble, synthetic organic hydroxyxanthene dye that is available in several forms: as a 0.25% solution with an anesthetic (benoxinate or proparacaine) and a preservative, as a 2% nonpreserved unit-&#173;dose eyedrop, and in impregnated paper strips. Fluorexon, a related macromolecular compound, is available as a 0.35% nonpreserved solution that does not stain most contact lenses. Staining is easily detected with a cobalt-&#173;blue filter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fluorescein is most commonly used for applanation tonometry and evaluation of the tear film, including filaments. <span class="italic">Tear breakup time (TBUT)</span> is measured by instilling fluorescein, asking the patient to hold the eyelids open after 1 or 2&#160;blinks, and counting the seconds until a dry spot appears. The appearance of dry spots in less than 10&#160;seconds is considered abnormal. TBUT is further discussed in Chapter&#160;3. Fluorescein detects disruption of intercellular junctions and stains punctate and macroulcerative epithelial defects (positive staining), such as herpetic dendritic lesions and dysplastic epithelium. It can also highlight nonstaining lesions that project through the tear film (negative staining), as in epithelial basement membrane dystrophy and Thygeson superficial punctate keratitis. Different disease states can produce various punctate staining patterns (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-21</span>). Fluorescein that collects in an epithelial defect will diffuse into the corneal stroma and cause a green flare in the anterior chamber. Pooling of the dye due to an indentation or thinning of the cornea must be distinguished from actual staining. This can be done by anesthetizing the eye and using a wisp of cotton from a cotton-&#173;tipped applicator to absorb the fluorescein in the area of concern. If the epithelium is intact, the dye will be removed, with no staining noted in the base. In the <span class="italic">dye disappearance test,</span> the tear meniscus is observed for the disappearance of fluorescein. Prolonged presence of the dye suggests a blockage of the drainage system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">Seidel test</span> is used to detect seepage of aqueous humor through a corneal perforation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-22</span>) or a conjunctival defect, such as a leaking trabeculectomy bleb. The examiner applies fluorescein to the site of suspected leakage using a moistened strip or concentrated drop and looks for a flow of clear fluid streaming through the orange dye under cobalt-&#173;blue light.</p>
			<p class="h3">Rose bengal and lissamine green</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rose bengal and lissamine green (both available as a 1% solution or in impregnated strips) are other water-&#173;soluble dyes. They stain the epithelial cells of the cornea and conjunctiva when a disruption occurs in the protective mucin coating. These dyes are routinely used for evaluating tear-&#173;deficiency states and for detecting and assessing various epithelial lesions, such as evaluating the extent of corneal intraepithelial neoplasia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-23</span>). Rose bengal is toxic to the epithelium. Lissamine green is better tolerated and has fewer toxic effects on cultured human corneal epithelial cells.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Evaluation of Tear Production</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">basic secretion test</span> is performed after instillation of a topical anesthetic and light blotting of residual fluid from the inferior fornix. To minimize irritation to the cornea during the test, a thin filter-&#173;paper strip (5 mm wide, 30 mm long) is placed at the junction of the middle and lateral thirds of the lower eyelid, with 5&#160;mm of the paper’s length folded within the inferior cul-de-sac and the remaining 25&#160;mm projecting over the lower eyelid. The test can be performed with the patient’s eyes open or closed, but some recommend that the eyes be closed to eliminate blinking. Although normal tear secretion is quite variable, repeated measurements of less than 3&#160;mm of wetting after 5&#160;minutes, with anesthetic, are highly suggestive of aqueous tear deficiency (ATD), whereas 3–10&#160;mm is equivocal. See Chapter&#160;3 for a discussion of ATD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">Schirmer&#160;I test,</span> which is similar to the basic secretion test but is done without topical anesthetic, measures both basic and reflex tearing. Less than 5.5&#160;mm of wetting after 5&#160;minutes is diagnostic of ATD. Although this test is relatively specific, its sensitivity is poor. Using lower thresholds increases the specificity of the test but decreases its sensitivity. The <span class="italic">Schirmer&#160;II test,</span> which measures reflex secretion, is performed in a similar manner but with topical anesthetic. However, after the filter-&#173;paper strips have been inserted into the inferior fornices, a cotton-&#173;tipped applicator is used to irritate the nasal mucosa. Wetting of less than 15&#160;mm after 2&#160;minutes is consistent with a defect in reflex secretion. Although an isolated abnormal result for any of these tests can be misleading, serially consistent results are highly suggestive of ATD. Schirmer testing is also useful in demonstrating to patients the presence of ATD. An alternative to use of the classic Schirmer strips involves use of a cotton thread impregnated with phenol red, which allows for quicker assessment of tear secretion but has not been fully validated.</p>

			<p class="h2">Tear Film Quantitative Tests</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As our understanding of the tear film has improved (see Chapter&#160;1), commercial assays to measure its various components have been developed. The objectivity and reproducibility of many of these tests have yet to be confirmed, and the results need to be evaluated in conjunction with symptoms and other clinical findings.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Microliter samples of tears can be used to measure tear film osmolarity. Values higher than 306–308&#160;mOsm/L are considered highly indicative of ATD. Other studies, however, have shown a lack of correlation between tear osmolarity and symptoms and objective signs of dry eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lactoferrin, an iron-&#173;binding protein secreted directly by the acinar cells of the lacrimal gland, plays an important antibacterial role in the tear film. Although it does not play a role in tear production, its levels are directly correlated to aqueous production. Microassays are now available to measure levels of lactoferrin, providing an indirect measure of lacrimal gland function.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in the tear film can also be measured with microassay technology, and increased levels can help distinguish between ATD and ocular allergies. Lactoferrin and IgE biomarkers can be measured in a single commercially available test requiring only 0.5&#160;µL of tears.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Matrix metalloproteinase&#160;9 (MMP-9) is an inflammatory cytokine released by distressed epithelial cells. Dry eye is multifactorial and can be associated with inflammation of the ocular surface and eyelids (eg, blepharitis), which in turn can cause the release of the inflammatory marker MMP-9. Elevated values (&gt;40&#160;ng/mL) might indicate evaporative dry eye (see Chapter&#160;3). However, this test is not specific for dry eyes, as high levels of MMP-9 are reported in conditions other than blepharitis, such as allergy, infection, and peripheral ulcerative keratitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sjögren syndrome is commonly associated with dry eye. Early biomarkers for this autoimmune disease may support the diagnosis in patients with systemic symptoms such as dry mouth and joint pains. A proprietary biomarker test is available that may be more sensitive than other blood tests, such as SS-A and SS-B antibody and rheumatoid factor tests.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Tear Film Qualitative Tests</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a major cause of evaporative dry eye and is discussed in Chapter&#160;3. Slit-lamp examination of the eyelid margin and meibomian gland orifices is an important clinical tool in the evaluation of MGD, but interferometry and infrared meibography have enhanced the ability to assess meibomian gland structure and pathology (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-24</span>). These tools allow clinicians to measure the height of the tear film meniscus and examine, with submicrometer accuracy, the thickness and structure of the lipid layer (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-25</span>). They also allow real-time evaluation of the blink rate, the completeness of blink patterns, and TBUT (noninvasive) and provide objective recordings of meibomian gland dropout.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-11">Pachymetry</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A corneal pachymeter measures corneal thickness, a sensitive indicator of endothelial physiology that correlates well with functional measurements. Optical pachymetry, which is performed using a special device attached to the slit-lamp biomicroscope, is somewhat imprecise and is rarely used today. Ultrasonic pachymetry, which is based on the speed of sound in the normal cornea (1640&#160;m/sec), is both easier to perform and more accurate. The applanating tip of the pachymeter must be perpendicular to the ocular surface because errors are induced by tilting. Scanning-&#173;slit technology, Scheimpflug-&#173;based anterior segment imaging, OCT, and high-&#173;resolution ultrasonography are newer techniques that can be used to produce precise maps of the entire corneal thickness, including curvature (see Fig&#160;2-19).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The thinnest zone of the cornea is usually about 1.5&#160;mm temporal to the geographic center, and the cornea becomes thicker in the paracentral and peripheral zones. The average central thickness of the normal human cornea is between 540 and 550&#160;µm. In the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study, the average central corneal thickness was higher, at 573&#160;± 39&#160;µm, but it was acknowledged that central corneal thickness was probably higher in the study population than in the general population. Corneal thickness affects the measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP), with thicker corneas producing falsely higher IOP readings and thinner corneas producing falsely lower readings. However, Liu and Roberts demonstrated that the biomechanical properties of the cornea, particularly stiffness, may have a greater impact on IOP measurement errors than does corneal thickness or corneal curvature. Adjustment for corneal biomechanical properties may lead to a more accurate measurement of the IOP. Despite these adjustments, low pachymetry measurements have been shown to be an independent risk factor for glaucoma even when the artificial lowering of IOP is accounted for.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pachymetry can also be used to assess corneal hydration and the function of the corneal endothelium in its dual role as a barrier to aqueous humor and as a metabolic pump. When functioning normally, the endothelial pump balances the leak rate to maintain the corneal stromal water content at 78% and the central corneal thickness at about 540&#160;µm. Acute corneal edema is often the result of an altered barrier effect of the endothelium or epithelium. Chronic corneal edema is usually caused by an inadequate endothelial pump. Early signs of corneal edema evident on slit-lamp examination include patchy or diffuse haze of the epithelium, mild stromal thickening, faint but deep stromal wrinkles (Waite-&#173;Beetham lines), Descemet membrane folds, and a patchy or diffuse posterior collagenous layer. Folds in the Descemet membrane are first seen when corneal thickness increases by 10% or more; epithelial edema occurs when corneal thickness exceeds 700&#160;µm. Stromal edema alters corneal transparency, but vision loss is most severe when epithelial microcysts or bullae occur. A central corneal thickness greater than 640&#160;µm, corneal thickening that is asymmetric between the 2&#160;eyes, or a thicker central cornea compared with inferior corneal measurements within the same eye may indicate a higher risk for symptomatic corneal edema after intraocular surgery.</p>

			<p class="h1">Corneal Esthesiometry</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal sensation is supplied by the ophthalmic division of the fifth (trigeminal) cranial nerve. Corneal esthesiometry is typically used clinically to evaluate for neurotrophic keratopathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the clinical setting, an evaluation of corneal sensation is most commonly achieved with a cotton-&#173;tipped applicator. This is performed without topical anesthesia and should be done before IOP is checked. A wisp of cotton from the cotton-&#173;tipped applicator is used to compare sensation in each eye. Approaching the patient from the side and testing all 4&#160;quadrants has the advantage of eliminating false-&#173;positive responses, which result when the patient sees the cotton-&#173;tipped applicator approaching the eye. The sensation in each location is recorded as normal, reduced, or absent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Various quantitative methods exist, but they are typically reserved for research or complex cases. The most common quantitative method is use of the handheld (Cochet-&#173;Bonnet) esthesiometer; this is discussed in the following section. Other methods include the noncontact air-puff technique, chemical stimulation using capsaicin, and thermal stimulation with a carbon dioxide laser.</p>
			<p class="h2">Handheld Esthesiometer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The handheld (Cochet-&#173;Bonnet) esthesiometer is a device that contains a thin, retractable nylon monofilament. Adjusting the length of the monofilament changes the pressure applied by the device.

			<p class="h1">Measurement of Corneal Biomechanics</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The biomechanical properties of the cornea affect its functional responses and can have a significant impact on vision. The cornea has both elastic and viscous elements, and these play a role in conditions such as keratoconus and ectasia. <span class="italic">Corneal hysteresis</span> is defined as the difference between the pressure at which the cornea bends inward during air-jet applanation and the pressure at which it bends out again. This difference, which is measured in millimeters of mercury, gauges elasticity, a biomechanical property of the cornea. Theoretical applications of these measurements might enable detection of corneas at risk for ectasia following corneal refractive surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A commercially available instrument now allows in vivo clinical testing of a cornea’s direct biomechanical properties. The <span class="italic">corneal resistance factor (CRF)</span> is calculated based on a mathematical correlation between hysteresis and corneal thickness. CRF values have a normal distribution within the general population but are lower in patients who have undergone LASIK or photorefractive keratectomy or whose corneas have an inherent biomechanical weakness, like forme fruste keratoconus. These values are also lower in patients who have corneal edema secondary to Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy. These measurements might also increase the accuracy of IOP measurements, which are affected by corneal properties such as thickness. However, use of the device may not be particularly effective in screening refractive surgery patients for risk of keratectasia or in documenting the increased stiffness associated with corneal crosslinking, aging, and diabetes mellitus, because it measures the viscous and not the elastic properties of the cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Newer technologies for evaluating corneal biomechanics integrate dynamic corneal imaging instruments using Placido disk–based technology, Scheimpflug imaging, or OCT and allow more accurate measurement of the corneal deformation produced by the collimated air puffs. These devices can differentiate the elastic biomechanical properties of normal corneas from those of ectatic corneas. They can also distinguish corneal <br />crosslinking–treated corneas from pretreatment corneas, using variables such as the quantitative amplitude of inward deformation (greater in softer, ectatic corneas) and the area of corneal tissue experiencing inward deformation (less in softer, ectatic corneas). Using these devices, investigators have shown that corneal deformation is influenced by the IOP and corneal thickness as well as the innate elastic biomechanical properties of the cornea.</p>
