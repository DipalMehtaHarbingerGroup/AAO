			<p class="chapter-title">The Patient With Transient Visual Loss</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Transient visual loss (TVL) is the sudden loss of visual function (partial or complete) in 1 or both eyes that lasts less than 24&#160;hours. In general, the most important cause of transient monocular visual loss (TMVL) is retinal ischemia due to temporary occlusion of the central retinal artery or its branches. The most common cause of transient binocular visual disturbance is migraine. A systematic approach to the evaluation of patients with TVL is imperative, beginning with a detailed historical account of the visual loss that includes the following points:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Monocular versus binocular.</span> Establishing TVL as monocular or binocular is important for localizing the lesion; monocular loss implies a prechiasmal problem (anywhere from the cornea to the optic nerve), whereas binocular loss is a chiasmal or retrochiasmal (intracranial) problem. In rare instances, binocular TVL can reflect bilateral ocular disorders. Patients should be asked if they occluded each eye during the episode of visual loss. Clinicians should be aware that transient homonymous hemianopia is frequently misperceived as a monocular visual loss in the eye with the temporal field deficit.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Age.</span> In patients younger than 50&#160;years, migraine is the most likely cause of binocular TVL. Arterial vasospasm can cause TMVL, but it is not common and is a diagnosis of exclusion. An important exception in pregnant women is eclampsia, in which TVL may be a harbinger of more serious and permanent visual loss, usually occurring within days of delivery (see Chapter&#160;14). In older patients, cerebrovascular disease and giant cell arteritis (GCA) should be considered.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Duration of visual loss.</span> Monocular or binocular transient obscurations of vision lasting only seconds are often precipitated by a change in posture (eg, bending over) and are a common complaint in patients with optic nerve head (ONH) drusen or papilledema. Sudden TMVL lasting several minutes (typically no more than 15&#160;minutes) is more suggestive of retinal ischemia from emboli. The duration of visual loss from retinal artery vasospasm varies; it may last seconds to 1&#160;hour. TMVL resulting from ocular hypoperfusion or venous insufficiency can last up to 30&#160;minutes. Occipital seizures are very brief binocular visual disturbances that last only a few seconds, whereas the binocular scintillating scotoma typical of migraine lasts 20–30&#160;minutes.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Pattern/description of visual loss and recovery.</span> The classic description of TMVL from retinal emboli is a descending curtain in 1&#160;eye; however, tunnel-&#173;like contraction of vision or sudden complete loss of vision may also occur. An altitudinal aspect of visual loss strongly suggests retinal emboli, but central retinal artery vasospasm can sometimes cause similar visual symptoms. Visual loss or disturbance precipitated by exercise can be caused by vasospasm, pigment dispersion syndrome, or demyelinating disease. <span class="italic">Uhthoff phenomenon</span> (transient visual blurring resulting from physical activity or elevation in body temperature) frequently occurs in patients with a current or previous episode of optic neuritis (see Chapter&#160;4). Posterior circulation ischemia typically causes complete bilateral TVL (ie, cortical blindness) or a homonymous hemianopia, often in association with brainstem and/or cerebellar symptoms. Binocular visual disturbances with geometric quality (eg, “fortification” pattern) strongly suggest occipital lobe dysfunction (eg, migraine, ischemia, or seizure). Whiteout of vision in both eyes or gradual constriction (ie, “closing in”) of peripheral vision without positive visual phenomena may also signal occipital lobe ischemia.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Associated symptoms and additional signs.</span> Positive visual phenomena and headache accompanying binocular TVL suggest migraine. Persistent headaches and pulsatile tinnitus suggest increased intracranial pressure. In an elderly patient, TVL accompanied by headaches, weight loss, fever, malaise, jaw claudication, and scalp tenderness strongly suggests GCA. The presence of other neurologic symptoms and signs can help localize the vascular territory involved. Loss of consciousness, dizziness, diplopia, dysarthria, or focal weakness accompanying binocular TVL suggests cerebral ischemia in the posterior circulation (basilar artery territory). Focal weakness contralateral to the TMVL or aphasia suggests cerebral ischemia in the anterior circulation (internal carotid artery territory). Ipsilateral periorbital pain in the setting of an ipsilateral Horner syndrome may indicate an internal carotid artery dissection (see Chapter&#160;10, Fig&#160;10-4). TVL associated with exercise or change in position may suggest hypoperfusion (eg, ocular ischemic syndrome). Skin or joint changes or Raynaud phenomenon may accompany systemic vasculitis.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Predisposing conditions.</span> The examiner should conduct a careful interview, eliciting information about the presence of vascular risk factors such as atheromatous disease (carotid stenosis, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysm), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, sleep apnea, cardiac source of emboli (previous myocardial infarction, valvulopathy, arrhythmia), intravenous drug use, family or personal history of a clotting disorder, systemic cancer, and history of connective tissue disease or vasculitis (eg, GCA or Takayasu arteritis).<p class="reference-single ParaOverride-1">Donders RC; Dutch TMB Study Group.

			<p class="h1">Examination</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although the patient may report complete recovery of visual function, a thorough examination is crucial to rule out ocular and orbital causes of TVL, to assess the afferent visual function, and to look for retinovascular clues (eg, emboli, cotton-&#173;wool spots, vascular attenuation, or hemorrhage) that might suggest a specific diagnosis. This process should include testing for best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (also called corrected distance visual acuity), color vision, and intraocular pressure (IOP), as well as an examination of the pupils (testing for relative afferent pupillary defect or Horner syndrome), a slit-lamp examination, perimetry to look for residual visual field defects, and a dilated funduscopic examination. A positive photostress recovery test may indicate macular ischemia (see Chapter&#160;3). When a vascular mechanism is suspected, retinal fluorescein angiography may be helpful.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Transient Monocular Visual Loss</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-table">Table&#160;5-1</span> outlines the most common ocular, orbital, and systemic causes of TMVL.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ocular Causes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nonvascular ocular causes of TVL are very common and are usually excluded by an ocular examination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tear-film abnormalities often result in blurred vision that improves with blinking or a tear supplement. These abnormalities may also be associated with brief sharp or stabbing pain. Slit-lamp examination may reveal keratitis sicca. Dry eye can also provoke blepharospasm, which can lead to moments of visual loss (see Chapter&#160;11, Fig&#160;11-10).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Opacities, inflammation, or blood in the media of the anterior chamber or the vitreous can also cause episodic visual disturbance. For example, recurrent hyphema occasionally causes TMVL in patients with intraocular lenses who have uveitis-glaucoma-&#173;hyphema (UGH) syndrome. Release of pigment in the anterior chamber during exercise may occur in pigment dispersion syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Transient monocular visual obscurations that are accompanied by halos and pain should always prompt gonioscopy of the anterior chamber angle to assess for angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. The anterior lens should be inspected for glaukomflecken, which indicate prior episodes of angle-&#173;closure glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">TVL, prolonged visual recovery, or persistent afterimages following exposure to bright light suggests macular disorders, such as serous detachment, age-&#173;related macular degeneration, or ocular ischemia. In such patients, the photostress recovery test is often abnormal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with papilledema or congenital ONH anomalies (eg, drusen or anomalous optic nerve) experience grayouts or blackouts of vision (so-called transient visual obscurations). Such episodes are typically brief (less than 10&#160;seconds) and often precipitated by changes in posture.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Orbital Causes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">TMVL that is specifically induced by moving the eyes toward a certain direction (gaze-&#173;evoked TMVL) suggests an orbital mass such as hemangioma or meningioma. The TMVL likely results from a combination of direct compression of the optic nerve and ischemia from positional vascular obstruction. Careful examination usually reveals other orbital findings, such as proptosis or limited ocular motility.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Vascular Causes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After ocular and orbital causes of TMVL have been ruled out, vascular causes must be considered. The term “amaurosis fugax” refers specifically to a retinal transient ischemic attack (RTIA). Retinal arterial ischemia, whether transient or permanent, is a form of anterior circulation ischemic stroke caused by decreased blood flow in the ophthalmic branches of the internal carotid artery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vascular TMVL is a well-known prodromal syndrome of cerebral infarction. Vascular causes of TMVL are most often related to retinal emboli. However, TMVL may also result from optic nerve ischemia in patients with GCA or diffuse ocular hypoperfusion in patients with severe carotid artery disease, or it may precede central retinal vein occlusion. Retinal emboli typically result in acute, painless visual loss in 1 eye, which is often described as a descending (or ascending) curtain over part or all of the visual field. The visual loss usually resolves over a few minutes. The examiner should conduct a careful interview and neurologic examination in order to look for contralateral neurologic symptoms and signs such as weakness and aphasia. Results of the ocular examination are often normal, although abnormalities of the retinal vasculature can occasionally be seen.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Emboli</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;5-1</span> shows the 3&#160;most common types of emboli: cholesterol (Hollenhorst plaque), platelet-&#173;fibrin, and calcium. The characteristics of these emboli are reviewed in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;5-2</span>. Other less common varieties of emboli include those resulting from cardiac tumors (myxoma), fat (long-bone fractures, pancreatitis), sepsis, talc, air, silicone, and depot drugs (corticosteroids).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Atheroma formation occurs most commonly at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery into the internal and external carotid arteries and in the carotid siphon (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-2</span>). Atheroma can remain stationary, become fibrotic, ulcerate, narrow and occlude the lumen, or release emboli. The internal carotid lumen must be reduced by 50%–90% before distal flow is affected, but emboli may occur on ulcerated atheromatous plaques with any degree of stenosis. Emboli from aortic arch atheroma are also common. Treatable risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking. In younger patients with TMVL and periorbital pain or headache, a carotid dissection should be considered.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cardiac emboli can arise from many causes, including cardiac arrhythmia, particularly atrial fibrillation, ventricular aneurysms, hypokinetic wall segments, endocarditis (infectious [associated with bacterial endocarditis] and noninfectious [marantic]), and valvular heart disease (including atrial myxoma).</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Clinical and laboratory evaluation</span> If an embolic cause of TMVL is suspected in a patient, a complete vascular and cardiac evaluation is urgently required; such patients have increased rates of morbidity and mortality from stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic aneurysm, and other related vascular events (see the following sections). Clinical examination should include assessment of the patient’s pulse (in particular examining for atrial fibrillation), blood pressure, cardiac auscultation, and carotid artery auscultation (best done at the angle of the jaw, where the bifurcation is located). A carotid bruit indicates turbulent flow within the vessel, and it may be heard with narrowing of the external or internal carotid artery. However, a bruit will be absent if flow is undisturbed <span class="italic">or</span> if carotid occlusion is complete.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once GCA is ruled out (in patients older than 50&#160;years), an immediate workup for a source of emboli must be initiated. Because RTIA may herald a devastating cerebral stroke, all patients with acute vascular TMVL should undergo a thorough vascular workup at once. It is best to immediately refer these patients to the nearest emergency department (preferably one affiliated with a stroke center). Sending a patient away for outpatient workup or to a primary care physician delays appropriate management.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is important to obtain noninvasive vascular imaging of patients with TMVL urgently. The carotid arteries (in patients with TMVL), the vertebral arteries (in patients with binocular visual loss), and the aortic arch can reliably be evaluated by carotid ultrasonography (duplex scanning), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or computed tomographic arteriography (CTA). Ultrasonography, while it is a sensitive method of detecting cervical ulcerated plaques, has varying reliability. MRA and CTA results enable the visualization and characterization of the plaque in question, as well as of the surrounding arterial wall; they are also extremely useful for detecting internal carotid artery dissection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Brain imaging performed to search for associated cerebral ischemia (ideally brain magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] with diffusion-&#173;weighted imaging [DWI]), should be obtained at the same time as the other tests for all patients with acute retinal ischemia, even those with TMVL. Results of studies have shown that up to 1&#160;of every 4&#160;patients with acute retinal ischemia has acute brain infarctions on DWI (often silent infarctions in patients who are neurologic asymptomatic). The probability of an abnormal MRI is higher in patients with embolic retinal ischemia (compared with patients with nonembolic retinal ischemia) and in patients with permanent visual loss (compared with patients with TVL). According to the 2013 guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA), if the brain MRI shows acute cerebral ischemia, even if the patient is neurologically asymptomatic, the patient should be admitted to the hospital for a stroke and managed accordingly.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Echocardiography is useful for detecting valvular and cardiac wall defects, intracardiac tumors, and large thrombi. Transesophageal echocardiography, which is more sensitive than conventional transthoracic echocardiography, also allows evaluation of the aortic arch. A normal-&#173;appearing echocardiogram does not exclude the possibility of emboli because very small particles are not revealed. Prolonged inpatient cardiac monitoring or ambulatory Holter monitoring may document previously undetected cardiac arrhythmias. Suspected endocarditis should prompt blood culture testing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If a cardiac or carotid source of embolism formation is not found, other systemic processes that could contribute to the stroke need to be considered. Major risk factors include advanced age, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and sleep apnea. Most of these conditions are treatable. Laboratory studies should be obtained to evaluate for these conditions and any others under clinical suspicion such as hypercoagulable states, collagen vascular diseases, vasculitis, or syphilis, depending on the presenting signs and symptoms of the patient.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Prognosis and treatment</span> Among patients with TMVL, significant carotid artery stenosis or occlusion is present in 53%–83% of cases. RTIA is a well-known prodromal syndrome of ischemic cerebral stroke; indeed, a transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a medical emergency associated with a high risk of early ischemic stroke and other cardiovascular events. Among patients with TIA (RTIA or hemispheric TIA [HTIA]), 10%–15% have a stroke within 90&#160;days, with approximately half occurring within 48&#160;hours. Individuals with TIA who survive the initial high-risk period have a 10-year stroke risk of approximately 19% and a combined 10-year risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death of 43% <br />(or approximately 4% per year). These statistics demonstrate the need for the urgent referral of patients with all types of TIA to an emergency department for expert evaluation and immediate treatment. As mentioned earlier, the most recent international guidelines from the AHA recommend that all patients with presumed retinal ischemia (whether transient or permanent) undergo urgent brain imaging and etiologic testing similar to patients with acute cerebral ischemia. According to these guidelines, an acute stroke is diagnosed in patients with abnormal DWI (these patients are then admitted to the hospital and managed accordingly), regardless of the patients’ initial clinical presentation, whereas patients with normal MRI results usually are evaluated within 24&#160;hours in a stroke clinic or an emergency department observation unit affiliated with a stroke center. Although the risk of stroke after an RTIA related to carotid atherosclerosis is lower than that after an HTIA, RTIAs must be managed similarly to HTIAs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several factors have been used to stratify the stroke risk in patients with RTIA, including male sex, age 75&#160;years or older, previous history of HTIA or cerebral stroke, intermittent leg claudication, stenosis of 80%–94%, and absence of collateral vessels on cerebral angiography. Patients with none or only 1 of these risk factors have a 3-year ipsilateral stroke risk of 1.8%. However, for patients with 2&#160;risk factors, the stroke risk is 12.3%, and for patients with 3 or more risk factors, the stroke risk increases to 24.2%. Thus, surgical management of carotid atheromatous stenosis (eg, carotid endarterectomy) may be more beneficial for those patients who have RTIA and 3 or more of these risk factors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Medical treatment of RTIA due to carotid artery stenosis begins with antiplatelet agents (aspirin, aspirin-&#173;dipyridamole, or clopidogrel). Treating the vascular risk factors and employing other secondary prevention measures (eg, carotid endarterectomy, treating arrhythmia, treating cardiac sources of emboli) is essential; treatment should be initiated as soon as possible by a stroke neurologist.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Additional systemic causes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Other possible systemic causes of vascular TMVL are ophthalmic artery disease, vasculitis (including GCA), hyperviscosity syndrome, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and central retinal artery vasospasm.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Vasculitis</span> TMVL in older patients (usually older than 50&#160;years) can be caused by GCA and may signal impending acute and permanent visual loss in 1 or both eyes. Therefore, a directed history of older patients with monocular or binocular TVL should include inquiries about the following symptoms:</p>
			<ul>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">However, systemic symptoms of GCA are absent in up to 20% of patients with visual symptoms (so-called “occult GCA”). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein concentration, and platelet count should be assessed in all patients aged 50&#160;years or more who present with TVL (see Chapter&#160;14). If GCA is the suspected cause of TVL, immediate treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is the only way to prevent progression to permanent visual loss.</p>

Recurrent orbital pain that improves when the patient lies down is highly suggestive of carotid occlusive disease. In the early stages, patients may experience transient or persistent blurred vision or TMVL on exposure to bright light. Severe ocular ischemia causes anterior segment changes that may be confused with chronic intraocular inflammation. The patient may have decreased vision; a red, painful eye with episcleral vascular injection; and aqueous flare (ischemic uveitis). Even though neovascularization of the chamber angle and iris is common, IOP may be low, normal, or high. In this instance, low or normal IOP is the result of impaired ciliary body perfusion. Fundus changes may include dilated retinal veins, narrowed retinal arteries with microaneurysms, midperipheral dot-and-blot hemorrhages, and macular edema (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-3</span>). Treatment of OIS is challenging and includes ocular reperfusion (via carotid endarterectomy, or carotid stenting when possible), IOP-&#173;lowering drugs, and treatment for neovascularization, including panretinal photocoagulation. If the preoperative IOP is low, restoration of blood flow may precipitate dangerously high IOP. Once the patient incurs signs of chronic hypoperfusion, however, improvement is unlikely. In other patients, carotid occlusion may be too advanced for surgical correction. Early detection is crucial because neovascularization and progressive ocular is&#173;chemia result from prolonged hypoperfusion (see also BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous</span>).</p>

Patients are generally young and experience stereotypic episodes of painless severe TMVL. The vision returns to normal in between episodes, and the prognosis is usually good. The ocular examination findings are usually normal, but occasionally, when the patient is seen during the episode of visual loss, funduscopic examination reveals constriction of the retinal arteries. The diagnosis of vasospastic TMVL is one of exclusion. Before a diagnosis of vasospastic TMVL is made, the workup should rule out all causes of embolic retinal TIA. If the patient is older than 50&#160;years, tests for erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein concentration should be obtained to rule out GCA. Particularly in younger patients, hyperviscosity syndrome and hypercoagulable states (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombocytosis, or other thrombophilia disorders) should be considered.</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Migraine</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common cause of binocular TVL is the homonymous hemianopic defect caused by migrainous visual aura. The patient typically notes a small scotoma in homonymous portions of the visual field, surrounded by jagged, luminous, shimmering edges. The scotoma enlarges over several minutes, sometimes to a complete homonymous hemianopia, then gradually disappears. The vision typically returns to normal within 20–30&#160;minutes (the aura may be as short as 5 minutes; it is always less than 1&#160;hour). The visual aura is usually followed by a headache, although some patients may experience the typical aura without headache (previously termed acephalgic migraine). The patient’s vision is completely normal between episodes, and the visual phenomena typically change sides. Evaluation of migraine is discussed in Chapter&#160;12.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Occipital Mass Lesions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In a patient with episodic headaches and binocular TVL, if the attacks always occur on the same side, a structural lesion—usually an occipital arteriovenous malformation or tumor—must be ruled out. Such patients require contrast-&#173;enhanced brain MRI and/or MRA.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Occipital Ischemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Episodes of complete binocular TVL may represent a TIA that involves the occipital lobes in the distribution of the basilar artery or the posterior cerebral arteries (see Chapter&#160;1); these episodes are particularly common in older patients with vascular risk factors or cardiac anomalies. As opposed to migraine, hemianopic events of ischemic origin are typically sudden in onset and last only a few minutes. There may be an associated headache, especially in the brow contralateral to the hemianopia, but the pain occurs at the time of TVL. Nonophthalmic symptoms of TIAs in the vertebrobasilar system are discussed in Chapter&#160;14.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with suspected occipital TIA must be referred immediately to an emergency department and evaluated by a neurologist.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Occipital Seizures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Occipital seizures typically produce unformed positive visual phenomena, such as colored or swirling lights or a whiting out of vision, like “bubbles” or “a flashbulb going off.” However, some patients experience negative visual symptoms, typically described as a blacking out of vision. These episodes usually last a few seconds to minutes, although they may persist for many hours (status epilepticus amauroticus). Most adults with occipital seizures harbor a structural lesion (eg, tumor, arteriovenous malformation, or trauma); in children, such seizures are more often benign. A normal electroencephalogram does not rule out seizures; prolonged electroencephalogram monitoring may be required. The visual symptoms resolve with anticonvulsant therapy.</p>
