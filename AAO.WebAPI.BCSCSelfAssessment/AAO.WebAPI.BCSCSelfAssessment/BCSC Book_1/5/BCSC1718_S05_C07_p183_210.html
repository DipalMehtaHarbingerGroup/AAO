			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most patients with acquired ocular motility disorders will have diplopia unless the motility limitation is symmetric. Depending on their motility limitation, some patients without diplopia in primary gaze may develop diplopia in horizontal or vertical gaze. Diplopia can also occur in patients with full ocular motility. Answers to the following questions, which are discussed in this chapter, offer important insight into the nature of a patient’s diplopia:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Does the diplopia resolve when either eye is covered (monocular vs binocular diplopia)?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Is the diplopia horizontal, vertical, oblique, or torsional?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Is the diplopia the same in all fields of gaze <span class="italic">(comitant)</span> or does it vary with gaze direction <span class="italic">(incomitant)</span>?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-2">Is the diplopia constant, intermittent, or variable?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h1">History</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with an ocular misalignment may report double vision or simply “blurred vision.” If closing either eye eliminates the visual disturbance, the blurred vision can be attributed to ocular misalignment (“binocular blur”). If binocular diplopia resolves when the patient closes either eye, it is because the diplopia results from misalignment of the visual axes. It is helpful to determine if the double vision is more bothersome with far or near fixation, or in a particular position of gaze. Ascertaining whether the patient has a history of head or eye pain, eye or eyelid swelling or redness, numbness, or other neurologic symptoms provides clues about possible orbital, cavernous sinus, or central nervous system causes of diplopia. It is also important to establish whether there is any history of malignancy, trauma, thyroid disease, or generalized weakness when formulating a differential diagnosis for binocular diplopia.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Physical Examination</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Maintaining alignment of the visual axes depends on coordinating the movement of both eyes. External examination may reveal obvious clues for the etiology of the patient’s diplopia, especially if proptosis or ocular redness is present. The movement of the eyes should be assessed in all positions of gaze, both individually <span class="italic">(ductions)</span> and together <span class="italic">(versions).</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">It is important to establish whether ocular misalignment is comitant or incomitant. Comitant misalignment is often present in congenital strabismus, whereas incomitant misalignment is evidence of an acquired disorder, except in rare cases. Abnormal ductions can often be recognized by gross observation, but formal measurement of the amount of misalignment with a prism and alternate cover test (PACT) is used to determine (quantitate) whether an ocular misalignment is comitant or incomitant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Maddox rod test, a sensitive method of obtaining quantitative information about the degree and pattern of ocular misalignment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-1</span>), can help reveal subtle cases of strabismus. When viewing a light source through a <span class="italic">red Maddox rod,</span> which contains a series of parallel cylinders, the patient sees a line perpendicular to the orientation of the cylinders. Typically, a red Maddox rod is placed in front of the right eye, producing a red line, while the left eye views the fixation light. Viewing such disparate images often makes it easier for patients to appreciate the misalignment of the visual axes. Because this test dissociates the 2&#160;eyes, patients who have a phoria will also report diplopia. Therefore, it is often useful to combine the subjective results of Maddox rod tests with the more objective results of the simultaneous PACT. PACT is used to determine the manifest deviation, paying attention to the pattern of misalignment in all 9&#160;positions of gaze (and, in some cases, to head tilt).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The double Maddox rod test helps identify and quantify torsional misalignment when vertical diplopia is present. Traditionally, a red Maddox rod is placed in front of the right eye and a white Maddox rod in front of the left eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-2</span>). Because patients may assume that the white line is oriented correctly and falsely localize the abnormal torsion to the red line (right eye), this test is best performed with a red lens in front of each eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A qualitative method for detecting relative cyclotropia uses a horizontal line. A base-down prism is placed over 1&#160;eye to dissociate the images such that 2&#160;vertically displaced lines are visible. The patient is asked whether both lines are parallel or if they converge to 1&#160;side. A cranial nerve (CN)&#160;IV palsy is typically associated with convergence of the lines toward the side of the palsy. A CN&#160;IV palsy may also be suspected if indirect ophthalmoscopy reveals appreciable extorsion of the ipsilateral fundus (ie, the fovea appears above the superior margin of the optic nerve head).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The presence of ocular deviation may be signaled by a consistent head tilt or head turn on examination. Old photographs (eg, a driver’s license photograph) may provide evidence of chronicity.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Monocular Diplopia</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As mentioned, patients may describe optical aberrations as distorted or double vision. Monocular diplopia usually results from abnormalities of the refractive media (eg, uncorrected astigmatism, corneal irregularities such as keratoconus and tear film abnormalities, and cataract). The characteristics of optical causes are seeing ghost images, haloes, or more than 2&#160;images. Monocular diplopia that resolves with use of a pinhole proves there is an optical etiology, obviating the need for a neurologic workup. Less commonly, monocular diplopia can arise from retinal pathology (eg, maculopathy with retinal distortion by fluid, hemorrhage, or fibrosis). Cerebral monocular diplopia or polyopia is always bilateral and extremely rare.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Differentiating Paretic From Restrictive Etiologies of Diplopia</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Restriction of eye movements should be strongly suspected in patients with proptosis, enophthalmos, or a history of orbital trauma or eye surgery. The most common causes of restrictive strabismus are thyroid eye disease and orbital trauma; these conditions are typically associated with orbital signs and symptoms. Diplopia in these patients may have both neural and restrictive components, especially after trauma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Paretic and restrictive syndromes may be distinguished by assessing saccadic speed. Paretic conditions reduce saccadic velocity, whereas restrictive conditions do not. If this method does not provide an answer, then the examiner may perform a <span class="italic">forced duction test</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-3</span>). A restrictive process produces a mechanical limitation of the range of eye movements that can often be felt by the examiner when forceps or a cotton swab is used to advance the limited eye movement. In rare cases, chronic neural lesions may also cause mechanical limitation by gradual shortening of the unopposed antagonist muscle; therefore, a “tight” muscle may give a false-&#173;positive result.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Comitant and Incomitant Deviations</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As previously mentioned, comitant misalignment is characteristically found in patients with congenital or early-&#173;onset strabismus. Patients with this condition typically do not report diplopia because of <span class="italic">suppression,</span> an adaptation that reduces the responsiveness of the visual neurons in the occipital cortex to the input from 1&#160;eye (see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> Chapter&#160;6, Fig&#160;6-5). Patients with a history of childhood strabismus may experience diplopia later in life if their ocular misalignment changes. For example, in patients with a long-standing exophoria, horizontal diplopia may develop in the fifth decade of life, when accommodation and convergence capacities wane.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Conversely, an incomitant deviation may become comitant with the passage of time. This spread of comitance may occur with either a restrictive or paretic incomitant deviation and is especially likely with a CN&#160;IV palsy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Incomitant strabismus is most frequently acquired and usually causes diplopia. If the deviation is very small, fusion may align the eyes and eliminate diplopia. Relatively small misalignments may produce blurred vision rather than an obvious perception of 2&#160;images. Patients with subnormal vision may not recognize diplopia or may have difficulty articulating how their visual perception changes in various positions of gaze. Congenital incomitant deviations, such as those caused by overaction of the inferior oblique muscles, typically do not produce diplopia, even when the strabismus is quite obvious. Generally, gross observation alone is not sufficient for the clinician to distinguish with confidence whether subnormal ductions are secondary to a paretic or restrictive process.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Localization</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Because many eye movement disorders have a neural basis, the clinician should attempt to localize the potential lesion that might be producing the patient’s eye movement disorder. Anatomical localization will dictate patient evaluation, including imaging modality and differential diagnosis. It is also useful to conceptualize the anatomical pathway of the ocular motor system (ie, extraocular muscles, neuromuscular junction, orbit, CNs, brainstem, premotor input, and cerebrum) that is assumed to be involved (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-4</span>). Adopting this kind of “wiring diagram” approach takes into account the supranuclear, internuclear, nuclear, and fascicular pathways within the brainstem, which then traverse the subarachnoid space, cavernous sinus, superior orbital fissure, and orbit, ending in the neuromuscular junctions of the extraocular muscles. In general, a lesion involving the CN&#160;nucleus or fascicle will cause neurologic deficits in addition to ophthalmoparesis (discussed later in the chapter). Central lesions can produce a clinically isolated CN&#160;III, IV, or&#160;VI palsy, but such isolated cranial neuropathies are the exception.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Attempts at neural localization may fail or give false results in the presence of diffuse disease (eg, meningeal inflammation, as in sarcoidosis). In addition, this approach is not helpful in a clinical syndrome, such as Wernicke encephalopathy, in which imaging may not show characteristic structural disturbances.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Supranuclear Causes of Abnormal Ocular Motility</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most supranuclear disorders affect both eyes equally and therefore do not cause diplopia. However, certain supranuclear lesions do not result in a symmetric effect and thus may produce ocular misalignment and diplopia (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;7-1</span>; also see Chapter&#160;8).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Nuclear Causes of Diplopia</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The CN&#160;III nucleus is actually a nuclear complex that contains subnuclei for 4&#160;extraocular muscles (superior, inferior, medial recti, and inferior oblique), a single subnucleus (central caudal nucleus) for the levator palpebrae muscles, and paired subnuclei (Edinger-&#173;Westphal nuclei) for the pupillary constrictor muscles (see Chapter&#160;1). Because the single central caudal nucleus controls both levator palpebrae superioris muscles, and the superior rectus fascicles decussate just after emerging from their subnuclei, lesions of the CN&#160;III nuclear complex either affect or spare both upper eyelids and may affect the contralateral superior rectus muscle. Injury to the CN&#160;III nuclear complex, while uncommon, may occur secondary to reduced perfusion through a small, paramedian-&#173;penetrating blood vessel, causing unilateral damage to 1&#160;nuclear complex. Such lesions are often asymmetric and may affect the CN&#160;III fascicle on one side in addition to the nucleus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intraparenchymal (either nuclear or intra-&#173;axial) lesions of CN&#160;IV are rare, given the relatively short course of the nerve within the brainstem. A lesion of the CN IV nucleus is clinically identical to a fascicular lesion. Microvascular, inflammatory, neoplastic, or demyelinating lesions may involve the central course of CN&#160;IV. Occasionally, a CN&#160;IV palsy may be accompanied by a contralateral Horner syndrome (first-&#173;order neuron lesion) because of the proximity of the descending sympathetic pathway to the caudal portion of the nucleus. A relative afferent pupillary defect may also be associated with a CN&#160;IV palsy due to the pupillary fibers running in the nearby brachium of the superior colliculus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A selective lesion of the CN&#160;VI nucleus causes a horizontal gaze palsy and not an isolated abduction paresis in 1&#160;eye; therefore, patients with this lesion may not experience diplopia. This occurs because the CN&#160;VI nucleus contains 2&#160;populations of motoneurons: (1)&#160;those that innervate the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle and (2)&#160;those that travel via the medial longitudinal fasciculus to innervate the contralateral medial rectus subnucleus of the CN&#160;III nuclear complex. Often, ipsilateral upper and lower facial weakness is also present with a nuclear CN&#160;VI palsy due to the adjacent facial nerve fascicle (eg, facial colliculus syndrome).</p>

			<p class="h1">Internuclear Causes of Diplopia</p>
            <div id="Chapt7_Top9">
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the context of eye movement control, an “internuclear” lesion is one that disrupts the <span class="italic">medial longitudinal fasciculus</span> (<span class="italic">ML</span><span class="italic">F</span>)<span class="italic">,</span> a bundle of fibers that connects the CN&#160;VI nucleus on one side of the pons to the medial rectus subnucleus (of CN&#160;III) on the contralateral side of the midbrain (see Chapter&#160;1, Fig&#160;1-27). This type of lesion produces an <span class="italic">internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO).</span></p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cardinal sign of a unilateral INO is slowed adducting saccadic velocity in 1&#160;eye, usually associated with abducting nystagmus of the fellow eye. The eye with the slowed adduction may have a full or limited range of adduction (Video 7-1; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-5</span>). Convergence may be spared or disrupted. A skew deviation, often with hyperdeviation ipsilateral to the lesion, may be present. The INO is named for the side with slowed adduction (ie, a right INO refers to slowed adduction of the right eye secondary to a MLF lesion on the right side of the brainstem). Patients with INO may report horizontal diplopia; they may also experience vertical-&#173;oblique diplopia due to an associated skew deviation, episodic diplopia related to head–eye movements if the lesion is partial, or difficulty tracking fast-&#173;moving objects <br />(eg, when playing sports) because of the mismatch in saccadic velocity between the eyes.</p>

                <p class="body-text">A bilateral INO produces bilateral adduction lag, bilateral abducting nystagmus, and <span class="italic">vertical, gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus</span> that is most noticeable in upgaze. This nystagmus is due to disruption of vertical vestibular pursuit and gaze-&#173;holding pathways, which ascend from the vestibular nuclei through the MLF. A large-&#173;angle exotropia may occur in bilateral INO (ie, “wall-eyed” bilateral INO, or <span class="italic">WEBINO,</span> syndrome) and is often caused by a midbrain lesion near the CN&#160;III nuclei.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The 2 most common causes of INO are demyelination and stroke. In adolescents and younger adults, INO is typically caused by demyelination. In older adults, microvascular disease is the most common cause. Other causes include infection, neoplasm, trauma, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Myasthenia gravis can produce pseudo-INO, which usually lacks the vertical gaze–evoked nystagmus of a true INO and is often accompanied by myasthenic eyelid signs. The adduction paresis of myasthenic pseudo-INO may resolve transiently after intravenous administration of edrophonium and typically responds to appropriate systemic therapy (see Chapter 14).</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">One-and-a-half syndrome, which combines a horizontal gaze palsy and ipsilateral INO (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-6</span>), is caused by a pontine abnormality that is large enough to involve the MLF and the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) or the CN&#160;VI nucleus on the same side of the brainstem. The only horizontal eye movement remaining is abduction of the eye contralateral to the lesion (ie, horizontal eye movements are lost in 1&#160;eye, whereas they are “half” lost in the fellow eye, hence the name). Vertical gaze is preserved. A lesion that produces one-and-a-half syndrome but also involves the intra-&#173;axial portion of CN&#160;VII is termed <span class="italic">eight-and-a-half syndrome</span> (7&#160;+&#160;1.5 =&#160;8.5). Stroke is the most common cause of this disorder.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intra-axial <span class="italic">(fascicular)</span> ocular motor CN&#160;palsies are due to lesions of the nerve distal to its nucleus but within the confines of the brainstem. Brainstem lesions tend to affect many structures and therefore produce numerous deficits, allowing accurate topographic localization of the lesion. In the midbrain, intra-&#173;axial lesions can damage either CN&#160;III or CN&#160;IV. Intra-&#173;axial involvement of the CN&#160;III fascicle can produce 1 of 4&#160;syndromes, each of which includes an ipsilateral CN&#160;III palsy:</p>
                <p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-3">&#9;1.&#9;Damage to the ventral midbrain and the cerebral peduncle can cause a contralateral hemiparesis <span class="italic">(Weber syndrome).</span></p>
                <p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;2.&#9;Involvement of the red nucleus and substantia nigra may produce contralateral ataxia or tremor <span class="italic">(Benedikt syndrome).</span></p>
                <p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;3.&#9;Damage to the dorsal midbrain may involve the superior cerebellar peduncle and produce contralateral ataxia <span class="italic">(Claude syndrome).</span></p>
                <p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-13">&#9;4.&#9;Dorsal lesion with a slightly different configuration can produce the same type of ataxia plus a CN&#160;III nuclear lesion and features of supranuclear eye movement dysfunction <span class="italic">(Nothnagel syndrome).</span></p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The localization and direct anatomical correlations of these lesions are more important than the eponyms, especially because the use and definitions of these eponyms have varied in the literature.</p>
                <p class="body-text">As mentioned, involvement of CN&#160;IV within the brainstem is uncommon. Pineal tumors may compromise the proximal course of both CNs&#160;IV by compressing the tectum of the midbrain. Such lesions may also obstruct the Sylvian aqueduct, leading to elevated intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus, as well as dorsal midbrain syndrome (see Chapter&#160;8).</p>
                <p class="body-text">Intra-axial lesions of the CN&#160;VI nucleus may also injure CN&#160;VII, whose fibers curve around the CN&#160;VI nucleus at the <span class="italic">facial genu</span> (see Chapter&#160;1, Fig&#160;1-36). Intra-&#173;axial lesions that involve the CN&#160;VI fascicle may also damage the CN&#160;VII fascicles, the tractus solitarius, and the descending tract of CN&#160;V, resulting in an ipsilateral abduction palsy, facial weakness, loss of taste over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and facial hypoesthesia <span class="italic">(Foville syndrome).</span> Lesions of the ventral pons can damage CN&#160;VI and CN&#160;VII along with the corticospinal tract, producing contralateral hemiplegia, ipsilateral facial weakness, and abduction deficit <span class="italic">(Millard-&#173;Gubler syndrome).</span></p>
                <p class="body-text">The subarachnoid segment of the ocular motor CNs extends from the brainstem to the cavernous sinus, where the nerves exit the dura. It is believed that most ischemic CN&#160;palsies occur within this section. Ischemic cranial mononeuropathies typically occur in isolation, with maximal deficit at presentation, but occasionally the loss of function progresses over 7–10&#160;days. Pain may or may not be present; if present, it may be quite severe in some patients. Therefore, pain does not distinguish ischemia from aneurysmal compression.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Ocular misalignment due to ischemic ocular motor CN&#160;palsy almost always improves over time, and the diplopia usually resolves within 6&#160;months. Patients require medical evaluation for ischemic risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertensive vascular disease, and elevated serum lipid levels. Progression of ocular misalignment beyond 2&#160;weeks or failure to improve within 3&#160;months is inconsistent with an ischemic cause of a cranial neuropathy and should prompt a thorough evaluation for another etiology. An isolated mononeuropathy of CN&#160;III warrants special attention because of the nerve’s close anatomical proximity to the cerebral vasculature (especially the posterior communicating artery) and the potential for aneurysmal compression (discussed later in this chapter).</p>
                <p class="body-text">Myasthenia gravis may mimic any pattern of painless, pupil-&#173;sparing extraocular muscle dysfunction and should be included in the differential diagnosis of such cases. Approximately 10%–15% of patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) may present with diplopia from a skew deviation, ischemic cranial neuropathy, or extraocular muscle ischemia.</p>
                <p class="body-text">If the patient has a history of cancer and an ocular motor cranial neuropathy is present, neuroimaging should be performed to rule out a compressive or infiltrative lesion.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">CN&#160;III palsies can cause dysfunction of the somatic muscles (superior, inferior, and medial recti; inferior oblique; and levator palpebrae superioris) and the autonomic muscles (pupillary sphincter and ciliary) (Video 7-2). A complete CN&#160;III palsy presents with downward and outward deviation of the eye; complete ptosis; and the inability to adduct, infraduct, or supraduct the eye. The pupil may or may not be involved in a complete CN&#160;III palsy. Pupillary involvement, which is discussed later in the chapter, is a critical distinction in the setting of a CN&#160;III palsy. Partial CN&#160;III palsies are more common; they present with variable limitation of supraduction, infraduction, adduction, and variable ptosis with or without pupillary dysfunction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-7</span>).</p>

                <p class="body-text">Most isolated unilateral CN&#160;III palsies result from (presumed) microvascular injury in the subarachnoid space or cavernous sinus. Less common causes include aneurysmal compression, tumor, inflammation (eg, sarcoidosis), vasculitis, infection (eg, meningitis), infiltration (eg, lymphoma, carcinoma), and trauma.</p>
                <p class="h3">Pupil-involving third cranial nerve palsy</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pupillary dysfunction with CN&#160;III palsy results from loss of parasympathetic input and produces a mid-&#173;dilated pupil that responds poorly to light. Patients may present with variable dysfunction of the levator palpebrae or extraocular muscles. Aneurysms that arise at the junction of the posterior communicating artery (PCoA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) are juxtaposed to CN&#160;III and are, therefore, in a position to produce a CN&#160;III palsy as the initial manifestation of aneurysmal expansion or rupture. Pupillary involvement occurs because the pupillomotor fibers reside superficially in the medial aspect of the nerve adjacent to the PCoA (see Chapter&#160;1, Fig&#160;1-31). Thus, until proven otherwise, the clinician must assume that a nontraumatic CN&#160;III palsy with pupillary involvement or evidence of progression to pupillary involvement is secondary to an aneurysm. Emergent cerebrovascular imaging (eg, catheter angiography, magnetic resonance angiography [MRA], or computed tomography angiography [CTA], depending on clinical scenario and neuroradiologic consultation) should be undertaken (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-8</span>). These angiographic methods can detect almost all aneurysms at this location that produce a CN&#160;III palsy. Modern CTA and MRA techniques can reliably detect aneurysms as small as 3&#160;mm in diameter. Of these 2&#160;methods, CTA is faster, provides images with slightly greater resolution, and may show evidence of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired with the MRA is more likely to show non&#173;aneurysmal lesions. When neuroimaging appears normal, lumbar puncture may yield evidence of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (xanthochromia of the spinal fluid) or detect an inflammatory or neoplastic cause. Catheter angiography is often used for diagnostic confirmation and definitive treatment of the aneurysm but rarely for diagnosis alone. Although aneurysms are uncommon in patients younger than 20&#160;years, in rare cases they may present as early as the first decade of life.</p>
                <p class="body-text">A patient who presents only with efferent pupillary dysfunction (ie, the pupil is dilated and responds poorly to light) but exhibits normal eyelid and extraocular muscle function almost always has a benign disorder. Such isolated pupillary involvement is not a form of CN&#160;III palsy but rather represents a pupil that is either tonic (Adie), pharmacologically dilated, or mechanically damaged (see Chapter&#160;10). Before concluding that the problem is limited to the pupil, the clinician must exclude minor degrees of incomitant strabismus (via careful PACT or Maddox rod testing) in order to exclude a subtle CN&#160;III palsy. Tentorial herniation is not a plausible explanation for an isolated, fixed, and dilated pupil in the absence of altered mental status or other neurologic abnormalities.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Pupillary dysfunction, or a progressive loss of function, does not always indicate the presence of an aneurysm or other serious problem. The vasculopathic form of a CN&#160;III palsy may produce some efferent pupillary defect in up to 20% of cases, although the pupillary involvement is generally mild (typically ≤1&#160;mm anisocoria). Elevated fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin&#160;A<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1c</span>, serum lipid levels, or blood pressure indicate an increased probability that microvascular ischemia is the cause of the CN&#160;III palsy; however, patients with these risk factors may also harbor aneurysms. Thus, pupillary involvement should prompt neuroimaging in search of an aneurysm.</p>
                <p class="h3">Pupil-sparing third cranial nerve palsy</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">pupil-sparing</span> <span class="italic">complete CN&#160;III palsy</span> should be reserved for cases in which pupillary function is normal (ie, equal pupil size and reactivity), but there is total loss of eyelid and ocular motor functions of CN&#160;III. These are the typical findings for ischemic cranial neuropathy, which usually fully resolves within 6&#160;months. A pupil-&#173;sparing complete CN&#160;III palsy is almost always benign and secondary to microvascular disease (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia). An acute, isolated, pupil-&#173;sparing (but otherwise complete) CN&#160;III palsy in a patient over 50&#160;years of age with known vascular risk factors and without history of cancer does not necessarily require neuroimaging. However, a general medical evaluation is indicated to assess the patient’s serum glucose levels, systemic blood pressure, and serum lipid levels. In older adults, screening for vasculitis (eg, GCA) using Westergren sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and platelets must also be considered. If progression occurs, other cranial neuropathies develop, or the expected improvement does not ensue within 3&#160;months, then neuroimaging should be undertaken to search for a mass or infiltrative lesion at the base of the skull or within the cavernous sinus. Occasionally, neuroimaging studies need to be repeated to discover a mass, especially if it is within the cavernous sinus. Lumbar puncture may be needed to detect carcinomatous meningitis, inflammation, or infection.</p>
                <p class="body-text">In contrast, if the pupil-&#173;sparing CN&#160;III palsy is <span class="italic">partial,</span> the pupil reacts normally, with incomplete impairment of levator palpebrae and extraocular muscle function. Although the pupil is normal, this does not have the same benign implication as in pupil-&#173;sparing but otherwise complete oculomotor paresis, given that many other fibers within CN&#160;III are also “spared.” This distinction is crucial because some partial CN&#160;III palsies with normal pupillary function are due to compressive lesions, including aneurysm, and may later progress to involve the pupil (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-9</span>). An MRA or CTA is therefore indicated to exclude an aneurysm. If the MRA/CTA is negative and the CN&#160;III palsy has progressed on follow-up, MRI of the brain and orbits using a gadolinium contrast agent should be obtained to search for an anatomical lesion. As mentioned, if the pupil is involved in any CN III palsy, neuroimaging is indicated.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The presence of head and periorbital pain is not helpful in establishing the cause of the CN&#160;III palsy. Although most CN&#160;III palsies caused by aneurysms present with pain, many vasculopathic palsies also produce pain that, in some cases, may be intense.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Patients with partial CN&#160;III palsy secondary to aneurysm tend to have better recovery of function than patients with complete CN&#160;III palsy after undergoing the same neurosurgical intervention. Better recovery is also seen in patients with partial CN&#160;III palsy versus those with complete CN&#160;III palsy resulting from pituitary adenoma or apoplexy.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">CN&#160;III branches into superior and inferior divisions within the cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure. Isolated involvement of either division usually indicates a lesion of the anterior cavernous sinus or posterior orbit. The initial diagnostic study of choice is cranial and orbital MRI with contrast and fat suppression in addition to an MRA. If neuroimaging results are normal, then medical evaluation is warranted, including assessment of blood pressure, blood glucose, and serum lipid levels, in addition to Westergren sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in the appropriate clinical scenario. In rare cases, a divisional CN&#160;III palsy may be secondary to brainstem disease, usually from small-&#173;vessel stroke (lacunae) or demyelination. Aneurysms are a much less common but potentially lethal cause of divisional CN&#160;III palsy. Rare additional causes include tumors, inflammation (eg, sarcoidosis, vasculitis), infection (eg, meningitis), infiltration (eg, carcinomatous meningitis or lymphoma), and trauma.</p>

The recurrent ophthalmoplegia usually presents as a CN&#160;III palsy, and onset most often occurs in childhood. Curiously, the ophthalmoplegia develops days after the onset of head pain. MRI may demonstrate reversible thickening and enhancement at the root exit zone of CN&#160;III. CN&#160;III schwannoma may mimic the fluctuating nature of this condition; however, CN enhancement will persist after resolution of the CN&#160;III palsy. Therefore, follow-up MRI is indicated.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">After nerve axons are damaged, the nerve fibers may regrow to innervate muscles other than those they originally innervated (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-10</span>). This fiber misrouting produces several synkinetic phenomena (ie, co-&#173;contraction of muscles that normally are not activated together). Classic findings include eyelid retraction with adduction or pupillary miosis with elevation, adduction, or depression.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Aberrant regeneration is common after trauma or compression by an aneurysm or tumor but does not occur with microvascular ischemia. Signs of aberrant regeneration without a history of CN&#160;III palsy—<span class="italic">primary aberrant regeneration</span>—are presumptive evidence of a slowly expanding parasellar lesion, most commonly a meningioma or carotid aneurysm within the cavernous sinus, which requires appropriate neuroimaging.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">An acute CN&#160;IV palsy typically causes diplopia that is worse in contralateral gaze, ipsilateral head tilt, and downgaze; hence, patients almost always report diplopia (or a tendency to close 1&#160;eye) while reading. In some cases, examination of the affected eye reveals limited downgaze in the adducted position, but in most cases ocular motility appears grossly normal. Accordingly, it is essential to perform PACT or Maddox rod testing to demonstrate a hypertropia that worsens on contralateral gaze and ipsilateral head tilt. Ipsilateral head tilting usually increases the vertical strabismus; thus, patients typically (subconsciously) tilt their head to the opposite side to avoid diplopia.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">Parks-&#173;Bielschowsky 3-step test</span> is an algorithmic approach to identifying ocular motility patterns that conform to dysfunction of a specific vertically acting extraocular muscle. The 3&#160;steps are as follows:</p>
                <p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-15">&#9;1.&#9;Find the side of the hypertropia in primary gaze.</p>
                <p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;2.&#9;Determine if the hypertropia is greater on left or right gaze.</p>
                <p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-17">&#9;3.&#9;Determine if the hypertropia is greater on left or right head tilt.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Excyclotropia of the affected eye should be assessed by double Maddox rod testing and indirect fundoscopy. The 3-step test is most helpful in determining whether a vertical strabismus conforms to the pattern of a CN&#160;IV palsy. For example, a right CN&#160;IV palsy shows right hyperdeviation that worsens on left gaze and right head tilt (positive 3-step test) and causes excyclotropia of the right eye. (For more on the 3-step test, see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span>) Occasionally, a skew deviation mimics a CN&#160;IV palsy on the 3-step test. However, in a skew deviation, the hypertropic eye will often be intorted as opposed to extorted, as it is in a CN&#160;IV paresis. In addition, moving the patient from sitting to a supine position (by reclining the examination chair) often reduces the magnitude of the hypertropia in skew deviation but has little or no effect on a CN&#160;IV palsy. Practically speaking, acquired vertical strabismus not from a CN&#160;IV palsy is often the result of the dysfunction of more than 1&#160;muscle and will not generate a positive 3-step test. In particular, TED, myasthenia gravis, or simultaneous dysfunction of multiple CNs can produce a variety of nonspecific patterns of ocular misalignment. The reliability of the 3-step test in identifying patterns of vertical strabismus lessens somewhat over time because of the phenomenon called “spread of comitance” (see the section Comitant and Incomitant Deviations).</p>

                <p class="body-text">CN&#160;IV palsies are often congenital. Recognized causes of congenital CN&#160;IV palsies include an anomalous superior oblique tendon, an anomalous site of its insertion, or a defect in the trochlea. Similarly, some cases of presumed congenital CN&#160;IV palsy are secondary to a benign tumor (eg, schwannoma) of the nerve. Patients may be asymptomatic until adulthood, when their vertical fusional amplitudes diminish and diplopia develops. Most patients maintain a chronic head tilt. The longstanding nature of the head tilt may cause facial asymmetry and can often be confirmed by reviewing old photographs (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-11</span>). Patients with a longstanding CN&#160;IV palsy have relatively large vertical fusional amplitudes (&gt;3&#160;Δ). Comparing superior oblique size on MRI between the affected and unaffected sides does not reliably distinguish acquired from congenital palsies.</p>
                <p class="body-text">In patients older than 50&#160;years, an isolated CN&#160;IV palsy is typically caused by microvascular ischemia. Function always improves and typically resolves within 6&#160;months. CN&#160;IV is particularly vulnerable to closed head trauma because of the unique dorsal midbrain-&#173;crossing anatomy. In addition, CN&#160;IV can be damaged by disease within the subarachnoid space or cavernous sinus.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Diagnostic evaluation for an isolated, nontraumatic CN&#160;IV palsy usually yields little information because most cases have congenital, ischemic, or idiopathic causes. In older patients, who are at increased risk for vasculopathy, a full medical evaluation is appropriate to assess for vascular risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension). Occasionally GCA can cause a CN&#160;IV palsy. Older patients should have follow-&#173;up evaluation to ensure recovery. Lack of improvement after 3&#160;months should prompt neuroimaging directed toward the skull base to search for a mass lesion. Other possible causes of an acquired vertical strabismus include orbital restrictive syndromes (eg, TED or previous trauma). Skew deviation, partial CN&#160;III palsy, or myasthenia gravis should be considered in atypical cases.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">CN&#160;VI is the most frequently affected nerve in an isolated ocular motor palsy. CN&#160;VI palsy presents as horizontal diplopia that worsens on ipsilateral gaze, correlating with an abduction deficit and esodeviation that increases with gaze to the affected side (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-12</span>). A pattern of divergence insufficiency or paralysis may occur during the evolving or resolving phase of a CN&#160;VI palsy (see Chapter&#160;8).</p>
                <p class="body-text">An ischemic mononeuropathy is the most common cause of an isolated CN&#160;VI palsy. Lesions of the <span class="italic">cerebellopontine angle</span> (especially acoustic neuroma or meningioma) may involve CN&#160;VI and other contiguous CNs, causing decreased facial and corneal sensation (CN&#160;V), facial paralysis (CN&#160;VII), and decreased hearing with vestibular signs (CN&#160;VIII). Chronic inflammation of the petrous bone may cause an ipsilateral abducens palsy and facial pain <span class="italic">(Gradenigo syndrome),</span> especially in children with recurrent middle ear infections. After exiting the prepontine space, CN&#160;VI is vulnerable to meningeal or&#160;skull-based processes, such as meningioma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, chordoma, or chondrosarcoma. In addition, CN&#160;VI is susceptible to injury from shearing forces of head trauma or elevated intracranial pressure. In such cases, injury occurs where CN&#160;VI enters the cavernous sinus through the <span class="italic">Dorello canal</span> (the opening below the petroclinoid ligament). The appearance of a CN&#160;VI palsy after seemingly minor head trauma should raise concern for a preexisting pathology, such as tumor compression, that makes the nerve more susceptible to injury.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Congenital CN&#160;VI palsies almost never occur in isolation. An abduction paresis that is present early in life usually manifests as Duane syndrome (see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> Chapter&#160;12).</p>
                <p class="body-text">Isolated CN&#160;VI palsies in adults older than 50&#160;years are usually ischemic. Ocular motility in such cases usually improves over time and typically resolves within 6&#160;months. Whether or not neuroimaging is required at the time of initial diagnosis is controversial. Some experts recommend neuroimaging at the time of initial presentation. As with other isolated ocular motor cranial nerve palsies, medical evaluation is appropriate. However, a cranial MRI is mandatory if obvious improvement has not occurred after 3&#160;months. Other diagnostic studies that may be required include lumbar puncture, chest imaging, and hematologic studies to identify an underlying systemic process such as syphilis, sarcoidosis, collagen vascular disease, or GCA. Recovery does not necessarily indicate a benign cause. Occasionally, a CN&#160;VI palsy will resolve spontaneously and then recur as a manifestation of an intracranial tumor or ocular myasthenia gravis.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Impaired abduction in patients younger than 50&#160;years requires careful scrutiny because few such cases are caused by ischemic cranial neuropathy. Younger patients should undergo appropriate neuroimaging. A CN&#160;VI palsy may be the only presenting ocular sign of a posteriorly draining carotid-&#173;cavernous fistula (eg, white eye shunt syndrome, discussed later in this chapter). If imaging results are negative, consideration should be given to evaluation for (1) neuromuscular junction disease by obtaining acetylcholine receptor antibody titers or performing edrophonium testing; (2) for mechanical pathophysiologies, such as TED with medial rectus muscle involvement; and (3) for meningeal-&#173;based disease by obtaining a lumbar puncture. Leukemia and brainstem glioma are important considerations in children. In adolescents and young adults, demyelination may be the cause, in which case MRI with fluid-&#173;attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging typically reveals T2&#160;hyperintensities consistent with multiple sclerosis. (See Chapter&#160;2 for a discussion of neuroimaging and Chapter&#160;14 for a discussion of multiple sclerosis.) Other potential CN&#160;VI palsy mimics include Duane syndrome (type&#160;1), spasm of near reflex, myasthenia gravis, TED, and medial orbital wall fracture with entrapment.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular neuromyotonia, a rare but important cause of episodic diplopia, is thought to be neurogenic in origin. Prior skull-based radiation therapy, typically for neoplasm (eg, meningioma), is the most common historical feature. Months to years postradiation, patients experience episodic diplopia lasting typically 30–60&#160;seconds. Ocular neuromyotonia may affect any of the ocular motor nerves or their divisions. Diplopia is often triggered by activation of the affected nerve in eccentric gaze with resultant sustained muscle contraction producing ocular misalignment (eg, CN&#160;VI neuromyotonia produces sustained lateral rectus muscle spasm of the involved eye and attendant exotropia). If unrecognized, such patients often undergo extensive and largely unnecessary workup in the search for a recurrent neoplasm. The disorder generally responds well to medical therapy. Carba&#173;mazepine and its derivatives constitute first-line treatment.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The framework for managing isolated ocular motor CN&#160;palsies presented earlier in this chapter assumes that no other neurologic abnormalities are present. Benign microvascular disease rarely causes simultaneous involvement of more than 1&#160;ocular motor CN. Simultaneous involvement of unilateral CNs&#160;III, IV, V, and VI, and sympathetic nerves strongly suggests a lesion of the cavernous sinus (see the following section). Bilateral involvement of the CNs suggests a diffuse process such as infiltrative disease (eg, carcinoma, leukemia, or lymphoma), a midline mass lesion that extends bilaterally (eg, chordoma, chondrosarcoma, or nasopharyngeal carcinoma), a meningeal-&#173;based process, an inflammatory polyneuropathy (eg, Guillain-&#173;Barré syndrome or its variant, the Miller Fisher syndrome, or sarcoidosis), or myasthenia gravis.</p>
                <p class="body-text">If symptoms or signs indicate that more than 1&#160;CN is involved, a neurologic evaluation should be undertaken. If neuroimaging is normal, a lumbar puncture with cytopathologic examination should be considered. Special testing for cancer-&#173;associated protein markers may be helpful in uncovering an elusive diagnosis. In suspected neoplastic meningeal involvement (ie, meningeal carcinomatosis), combined computed tomography–positron emission tomography (CT-PET) scans are often the studies of choice to demonstrate accessible biopsy sites. Repeat studies may be needed to obtain a definitive diagnosis. <span class="italic">Idiopathic multiple cranial neuropathy syndrome</span> should be considered only after neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, other tests, and extended observation have excluded neoplastic, inflammatory, or infectious causes.</p>
                <p class="h2 ParaOverride-21">Cavernous Sinus and Superior Orbital Fissure Involvement</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ipsilateral CN&#160;dysfunction involving a combination of CNs&#160;III, IV, V, and VI, and sympathetic fibers is the hallmark of ophthalmoplegia that is secondary to a cavernous sinus lesion (see Chapter&#160;1 for illustrations). The presence of CN&#160;V involvement with facial hypoesthesia, a third-&#173;order (postganglionic) Horner syndrome, or both is helpful for localizing the lesion to the cavernous sinus. If only 1&#160;CN is involved, it is usually CN&#160;VI, which is the only CN not protected within the lateral dural wall of the cavernous sinus. Aggressive lesions of the cavernous sinus, especially infectious or inflammatory processes, may compromise venous outflow and produce engorgement of ocular surface vessels, orbital venous congestion, increased intraocular pressure, and increased ocular pulse pressure.</p>
                <p class="body-text">It is often impossible to distinguish cavernous sinus lesions clinically from those involving the superior orbital fissure. The CNs pass through this fissure from the cavernous sinus into the orbit, and lesions often cross this anatomical boundary. In recognition of this difficulty, the more general designation of <span class="italic">sphenocavernous syndrome</span> or <span class="italic">parasellar syndrome</span> may be used. The offending lesion may extend toward the optic canal or into the orbital apex, in which case optic nerve function can be compromised. The designation <span class="italic">orbital apex syndrome</span> is then applied.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is an idiopathic, sterile inflammation that primarily affects the cavernous sinus. Severe, “boring” pain is almost always present. Neuroimaging may show an enhancing mass within the cavernous sinus. The pain typically responds rapidly and dramatically to corticosteroid therapy, but a positive therapeutic response may also occur with neoplastic mass lesions, especially lymphoma. Frequently, it is later discovered that the cause of the painful ophthalmoplegia in patients initially diagnosed with Tolosa-&#173;Hunt syndrome is neoplastic. Therefore, Tolosa-&#173;Hunt syndrome is a <span class="italic">diagnosis of exclusion.</span> Other causes of cavernous sinus lesions include aneurysm, meningioma, lymphoma, schwannoma, pituitary adenoma (with or without apoplexy), carotid-&#173;cavernous fistula, metastasis, sarcoidosis, and cavernous sinus thrombosis.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Abnormal connections between the cavernous sinus and the carotid artery or its branches introduce high arterial pressure into the normally low-&#173;pressure venous circulation of the cavernous sinus. Such a high-&#173;pressure connection may reverse blood flow within the superior ophthalmic vein and produce venous congestion within the orbit. Arterialization of conjunctival vessels is a classic sign of this fistula (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-13</span>). Patients with this condition may have either direct, high-flow connections between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus or indirect, “dural,” low-flow connections mediated by small arterial feeders off the internal or external carotids (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-14</span>). High-flow, direct fistulas most commonly occur after severe head trauma and produce a cranial bruit, whereas low-flow, indirect fistulas most often occur spontaneously, particularly in older women. The sequence of events leading to indirect fistula formation is not known. Physical examination cannot reliably distinguish between high-flow and low-flow fistulas, aside from a cranial bruit that indicates high flow. MRA, CTA, or cerebral angiography is necessary to make the correct diagnosis.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common cause of restrictive strabismus in adults is TED. Any of the extraocular muscles may be involved, but the muscles most commonly affected are the inferior and medial recti. When the inferior rectus muscle is involved, an ipsilateral hypotropia typically occurs in primary position that increases in upgaze—the restrictive process pulls the eye down and limits supraduction. When the medial rectus is the affected muscle, an esodeviation typically occurs that increases on lateral gaze to the same side (the enlarged, “tight” medial rectus restricts abduction). The diagnosis of TED is straightforward if associated with proptosis, chemosis, eyelid retraction, and eyelid lag; however, restrictive strabismus may be the only sign. Forced duction testing (see Fig&#160;7-3) may provide information to support this diagnosis. Neuroimaging results for patients with TED typically reveal enlargement of the extraocular muscle bellies with sparing of the tendons (see Chapter&#160;4, Fig&#160;4-16).

                <p class="h2">Posttraumatic Restriction</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blowout fractures of the orbit often cause diplopia. The most typical presentation involves fracture of the orbital floor with entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle or its fascial attachments. This entrapment, best illustrated with coronal CT of the orbit, mimics the pattern of vertical strabismus often present in TED. Less commonly, the medial rectus muscle becomes entrapped (see Chapter&#160;2, Fig&#160;2-15). Paretic strabismus from swelling also may occur in the acute phase. In either case, as the swelling resolves, so may the diplopia. Hence, decisions about the need for surgery for orbital blowout fractures must be made judiciously.

The onset of vertical diplopia immediately following surgery initially suggests nerve damage or myotoxicity from the local anesthetic. Over time, the initial paretic or myotoxic effect evolves into extraocular muscle fibrosis, leading to an overaction or a restricted eye movement pattern. Concomitantly, if the inferior rectus muscle is affected, the involved eye transitions from hypertropic (paretic) to hypotropic (restricted) status. In addition, restrictive diplopia may be caused by pterygium excision, scleral buckle placement, episcleral plaque brachytherapy, or tube shunt procedures.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Idiopathic inflammation of 1 or more extraocular muscles typically produces ophthalmoplegia and pain, often with conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, and sometimes proptosis. The pain may be quite intense and is exacerbated by eye movements. If the inflammation is confined to the posterior orbit, the eye may appear to be white and quiet. Results of CT or MRI typically show enlargement of 1 or more of the extraocular muscles with tendon involvement, and the inflammation often extends into the orbital fat (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-16</span>). Orbital myositis–related pain usually responds to systemic corticosteroid therapy within 24&#160;hours, whereas diplopia may take longer to resolve. Orbital myositis is usually an isolated phenomenon but may be part of a systemic disease such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener granulomatosis), systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, immunoglobulin G4–related ophthalmic disease, lymphoma, or, in rare cases, metastatic disease.

                <p class="h2">Brown Syndrome</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Brown syndrome is a restrictive ocular motor disorder that produces limited upgaze when the affected eye is in the adducted position. It is usually congenital but can be acquired. Acquired Brown syndrome is typically found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease, or trauma, including iatrogenic trauma, but in rare cases, it may be a manifestation of a focal neoplastic metastasis to the superior oblique muscle (see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>).</p>
                <p class="h2">Heavy Eye Syndrome</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">“Heavy eye syndrome,” also termed strabismus fixus, may result in progressive esotropia and hypotropia in patients with high myopia. The esotropia and hypotropia are associated with limited abduction and supraduction of the eye resulting from the superotemporal shift of the staphylomatous globe posteriorly, with medial displacement of the superior rectus muscle and inferior displacement of the lateral rectus muscle. The intervening connective tissue band also degenerates. Neuroimaging is necessary to confirm the muscle slippage. The preferred initial surgical approach for heavy eye syndrome is bilateral loop myopexy between the superior and lateral rectus muscles in order to restore the normal anatomic configuration, as opposed to medial rectus muscle recession or lateral rectus muscle resection, which can make the deviation worse.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sagging eye syndrome, which can be seen in older patients without the prerequisite of myopia, presents with a mild- to moderate-angle esotropia at distance (ie, divergence insufficiency), full lateral gaze, and minimal hypotropia with limited supraduction (see Chapter 8). The lateral rectus–superior rectus band degenerates, with inferior displacement of the lateral rectus muscle, in conjunction with the prolapse of connective tissue superotemporally, but there is no globe prolapse. In addition, patients often experience degenerative changes that can cause deep superior sulci, high lid creases, and ptosis resulting from levator aponeurosis dehiscence. Sagging eye syndrome is the mechanism underlying divergence insufficiency in the elderly. Augmented medial rectus muscle recession is typically successful in correcting the esotropia.</p>

                <p class="h2">Refractive Procedure–Induced Diplopia</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">In patients with childhood strabismus, diplopia may be induced by refractive procedures that cause a change in fixation preference to the nondominant eye (eg, monovision correction, cataract surgery on an amblyopic eye prior to the dominant eye, or noncycloplegic refraction leading to undercorrected hyperopia and fixation with the amblyopic eye). “Fixation switch diplopia” resolves with appropriate optical correction to reestablish fixation with the dominant eye.</p>

The cranial nerve segments within the brainstem are often referred to as being “intramedullary.” The subarachnoid space lies between the brainstem and cavernous sinus.
