			<p class="chapter-title">The Patient With Illusions, Hallucinations, and Disorders of Higher Cortical Function</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients are often reluctant to report “seeing things” due to concerns that it may reflect mental illness; however, many visual hallucinations or illusions are not a harbinger of psychiatric disease but are instead indicators of brain, ocular, or optic nerve pathology. The ophthalmologist should therefore make sure to ask patients about these symptoms. <span class="italic">Illusions</span> are false perceptions of visual stimuli. For example, a person looking at stationary high-&#173;contrast borders may perceive an illusion of movement. A <span class="italic">hallucination</span> is the subjective perception of an object or event when no sensory stimulus is present. Illusions should disappear with eye closure; hallucinations often do not.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When assessing a patient who reports illusions or hallucinations, the first step is to ascertain the patient’s mental status and the function of the patient’s afferent visual system. Patients with dementia or altered sensorium (eg, delirium, hypnosis) are prone to hallucinations. Reduced visual acuity or visual field loss often leads to positive visual phenomena. The ophthalmologist should determine the corrected distance visual acuity, assess color vision, and test for perimetry. By localizing the disorder anatomically, the ophthalmologist is able to establish a likely pathophysiology, or at least a differential diagnosis.</p>

			<p class="h1">The Patient With Visual Illusions and Distortions</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The alterations of perception that make up the spectrum of illusions can arise at various points in the visual system. Nonvisual causes of illusions and hallucinations are listed in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-1</span>.</p>
			<p class="reference-single ParaOverride-1">Fraunfelder FT, Fraunfelder FW, Chambers WA. <span class="italic">Drug-&#173;Induced Ocular Side Effects.</span> 7th&#160;ed. Philadelphia: Saunders/Elsevier; 2014.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ocular Origin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many illusions have an ocular basis and may be classified as optical or retinal (due to alterations in photochemical transduction).</p>
			<p class="h3">Optical causes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Irregularities in the eye’s refracting elements can produce visual distortion and resulting illusions such as ghost images (monocular diplopia), movement, or multiple images. Any alteration in the tear film (eg, dry eye syndrome) or in the corneal surface (eg, keratoconus, corneal edema, or scarring) can distort vision. Peripheral iridectomy may result in dysphotopsia and shadowing of images. Early cataract may produce visual distortion rather than decreased visual acuity, especially in eyes with early oil-&#173;droplet nuclear sclerotic changes or posterior subcapsular changes. The crystalline lens acts as a filter, changing the transmitted spectrum of light, and thereby producing altered perception of shape and color. Cataract extraction may also produce changes in brightness and color perception. After intraocular lens implantation, some patients experience temporal field visual disturbances such as an arc of light or a dark area, termed <span class="italic">positive</span> or <span class="italic">negative dysphotopsia,</span> respectively; these disturbances are typically transient and resolve spontaneously.</p>
			<p class="h3">Retinal causes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Any disruption of normal foveal architecture (eg, epiretinal membrane, macular edema, macular hole, or subretinal disease) can cause visual distortion. Changes in the position of the retinal photoreceptors can cause various alterations in vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Metamorphopsia (perceptual distortion) is characteristic of macular disorders. Patients with these disorders usually report that linear objects appear curved or discontinuous. In patients with intraretinal edema, the retinal elements are often pushed apart, causing micropsia (perceived image shrinkage). Macropsia (perceived image enlargement) is much rarer and can occur if the photoreceptors are pushed together.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The retina may be the source of changes in color perception (dyschromatopsia) associated with drug effects (eg, digoxin-&#173;induced yellowing of vision, sildenafil-induced blue tinge). Other changes in color perception may be related to vitamin A deficiency and choroidal or retinal ischemia, which can also lead to persistent afterimages or dazzle (brightness that temporarily confuses vision).</p>
			<p class="h2">Optic Nerve Origin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After an episode of demyelinating optic neuritis, a relative conduction delay within the affected optic nerve may lead to an altered perception of motion. Because of the disparity in neuronal transmission, a pendulum, for example, may appear to trace an elliptical path instead of its true single-&#173;plane oscillation <span class="italic">(Pulfrich phenomenon).</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Cortical Origin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Depending on the affected area (the primary visual cortex [V1] or the associative areas V2, V3, and&#160;V4), occipital lobe pathology may alter the perceived shape and position of an object, change perception of motion, cause color vision loss, or induce multiplicity of images. Patients with parietal lobe abnormalities commonly experience disorders of visual perception, such as micropsia, macropsia, <span class="italic">teleopsia</span> (objects appearing too distant), and <span class="italic">pelopsia</span> (objects appearing too close). See Chapter&#160;1 for anatomy discussion.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">The Patient With Hallucinations</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hallucinations are perceptions unrelated to active stimuli. They may originate anywhere along the visual pathway but occur most commonly within the globe or cortex. Hallucinations may be <span class="italic">formed</span> (eg, real objects such as animals, flowers, cars, or people) or <span class="italic">unformed</span> (eg, light, spots, dots, or geometric patterns).</p>
			<p class="h2">Ocular Origin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Unlike illusions, hallucinations have no optical causes. Vitreous detachment with persistent vitreoretinal adhesions may produce photopsias (flashing lights) or vertical white flashes (so-called lightning streaks of Moore). Such hallucinations are often apparent in a dark environment and may be induced by saccades. Retinal detachment may produce persistent photopsias and floaters.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Photopsias resulting from outer retinal diseases are often continuous. They may be simple white lights or form geometric webs that take on colors, including silver and gold. Photopsias often herald the onset of autoimmune retinopathy, including cancer-&#173;associated retinopathy, a paraneoplastic process. In addition, photopsia may accompany a variety of retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroidal abnormalities (eg, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, acute zonal occult outer retinopathy, or birdshot chorioretinopathy; see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> for more on these conditions).</p>
			<p class="reference-first">Gass JD, Agarwal A, Scott IU. Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy: a long-term follow-&#173;up study. <span class="italic">Am&#160;J Ophthalmol.</span> 2002;134(3):329–339.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Optic Nerve Origin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optic neuritis often produces phosphenes induced by eye movement or a dark setting. Patients with subacute or long-&#173;standing optic neuropathy may experience <span class="italic">sound-&#173;induced photisms</span> (sensations of color or light induced by a loud noise). These photisms are attributed to discharges from the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is also responsive to sound.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Cortical Origin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although the conventional teaching is that lesions affecting the anterior optic radiations (ie, temporal lobe) typically cause formed hallucinations while more posterior lesions (ie, parietal and occipital lobes) typically produce unformed hallucinations, there are many exceptions. In rare cases, lesions involving the mesencephalon may cause formed hallucinations (peduncular hallucinosis) that can be constant; they are usually associated with an inverted sleep-wake cycle. Associated symptoms may occur if adjacent midbrain structures are involved.</p>
			<p class="h3">Palinopsia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Interesting cortical phenomena may occur with disorders of both the dominant and, more frequently, the nondominant temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Palinopsia is visual perseveration after removal of the original stimulus (multiple afterimages) and can be divided into two categories: illusory and hallucinatory. Illusory palinopsia is triggered by contrast and/or motion; the visual afterimage or trails appear in the same location as the original stimulus. Migraine, hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and medications (eg, clomiphene, nefazodone, topiramate, trazodone, and zonisamide) can cause illusory palinopsia. In contrast, hallucinatory palinopsia is not affected by environmental conditions, and the perseverated image can occur in a different location than the original stimulus. When the afterimages are associated with homonymous hemianopia and appear in the blind hemifield, a posterior cortical lesion is usually present.</p>

			<p class="h3">Temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe lesions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Temporal lobe lesions most often produce olfactory and gustatory hallucinations; however, they can also cause complex, formed hallucinations in either the ipsilateral or the contralateral visual field. Epilepsy is the most common cause of hallucinations from this region. An accompanying visual aura implies that the seizure began focally.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the parietal lobe, hallucinations may be either formed or unformed, whereas occipital lobe disorders commonly cause unformed hallucinations. Patients with occipital lobe lesions may describe white or colored flashes of light, kaleidoscopic colors, moving discs, flickering, or a hexagonal array (eg, chicken-&#173;wire or honeycomb patterns). A complete whiteout of vision suggests bilateral occipital lobe ischemia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hallucinations within a homonymous hemianopia or quadrantanopia are generally complex; they may be static or move throughout the visual field.</p>

			<p class="h3">Migraine</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Abnormal excitatory activity in the cerebral cortex, followed by a wave of depressed neuronal function <span class="italic">(cortical spreading depression),</span> is believed to cause the visual phenomena of migraine. In migraine with aura, the binocular hemifield visual phenomena can last 5–60&#160;minutes and are often followed by a headache (see Chapter&#160;12). In addition to the classic fortification spectra (teichopsia), false sensation of motion (scintillations), and false perception of colors, patients may also experience “Alice in Wonderland effect” (micropsia and/or macropsia), formed or unformed images, or visual distortion. Common patient descriptions of visual phenomena experienced during a migraine with aura include heat waves, cracked glass, kaleidoscopic vision, or fragmented vision. Patients may also experience <span class="italic">typical aura without headache</span>, previously termed <span class="italic">acephalgic migraine. </span></p>
			<p class="h3">Persistent positive visual phenomena</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">These visual phenomena are often described as snow, television static, dots (black-and-white or colored), colored pixelated images, or a rainlike pattern affecting the entire visual field. Such visual phenomena usually last for months to years and, while bothersome, rarely interfere with visual function. They are commonly, but not exclusively, noted in patients with a personal or family history of migraine. Prophylactic treatment with migraine medication is usually unsuccessful. Persistent positive visual phenomena are distinct from migraine aura and cannot be attributed to another disorder. Isolated visual snow (with no other neurological or visual symptoms) may be a normal phenomenon.</p>

			<p class="h3">Sleep-associated visual hallucinations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hypnagogic hallucinations are vivid perceptual experiences that occur at sleep onset, whereas hypnopompic hallucinations are similar experiences that occur during awakening. Both phenomena are frequently associated with sleep disorders (eg, insomnia and daytime sleepiness) and may be suggestive of narcolepsy.</p>
			<p class="h3">Charles Bonnet syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Visually impaired patients with preserved cognitive status may experience visual hallucinations, a condition known as <span class="italic">Charles Bonnet syndrome.</span> Patients may have formed or unformed hallucinations that are either persistent or abruptly intermittent. Hallucinations may be elementary or highly organized and complex. Patients with this syndrome have a clear sensorium and realize the hallucinations are not real. If the cause of the vision loss is known and there is no homonymous visual field defect, neuroimaging is unnecessary. Common underlying conditions include age-&#173;related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and cerebral infarction. Medical treatment is often unsuccessful in suppressing the hallucinations.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">The Patient With Disorders of Higher Cortical Function</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The process of “seeing” begins when visual information reaches the occipital striate cortex (area&#160;V1). For visual awareness to occur, this information must be processed by the associative cortical areas (see Chapter&#160;1). Visual information is then projected through a ventral occipitotemporal pathway and a dorsal occipitoparietal pathway (see Chapter&#160;1, Fig&#160;1-22). The ventral pathway helps process the physical attributes of an image (the “what”) such as color, shape, and pattern. The dorsal pathway is important for visuospatial analysis (the “where”) and for guiding movements toward items of interest. In addition, interconnecting pathways are crucial for transferring information from the primary cortex to the associative areas (V2–V5).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, <span class="italic">cortical syndromes</span> due to abnormal visual processing result from either damage to the cortical areas responsible for processing information or from interruption of information flow between cortical areas <span class="italic">(disconnection syndromes).</span> Disorders of higher cortical visual function may be further subdivided into disorders of object recognition, visual-spatial relationships, and awareness of visual deficit (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-2</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2">Disorders of Recognition</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Object agnosia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Interruption of signal flow from the occipital lobe to the area of the temporal lobe involved in object identification results in an inability to recognize objects termed <span class="italic">object agnosia</span>. The condition, which is a form of visual–visual disconnection, often results from a bilateral ventral pathway dysfunction that affects occipitotemporal projections. Patients with object agnosia can identify objects by touch or description but not by sight.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Prosopagnosia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize familiar faces, is a more specific form of visual–visual disconnection. It is more frequently congenital, with acquired cases resulting predominantly from stroke. Patients usually have difficulty performing other visual memory tasks. The condition usually occurs with bilateral inferior occipitotemporal lobe damage but may also occur with right inferior occipital lobe damage. Accompanying superior homonymous visual field defects are common.</p>
			<p class="reference-single--no-space-">Schmidt D. Neuro-ophthalmological findings in patients with acquired prosopagnosia. <span class="italic">Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol.</span> 2015;253(3):333–334.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Akinetopsia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with pathology affecting the dorsal pathway (area V5; also known as MT, medial temporal area) may experience akinetopsia, which is the loss of the perception of visual motion, but still retain perception of form, texture, and color.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Alexia without agraphia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The interruption of visual information between the occipital lobe and the dominant angular gyrus causes visual–verbal disconnection. During the act of reading, the right occipital lobe receives visual information from the left visual field. This information is transferred to the left side of the brain through the corpus callosum and then relayed anteriorly to the angular gyrus of the parietal lobe for comprehension. If the splenium of the corpus callosum is damaged, the information from the left visual field (right occipital lobe) cannot cross to the opposite hemisphere (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-1</span>). Typically, the left occipital lobe is also damaged and no visual input reaches the angular gyrus, resulting in alexia (ie, the patient cannot read); however, because the structures anterior to the splenium are intact, the patient can produce language and write (alexia without agraphia). These patients cannot read what they have just written! This condition is usually due to infarction. If the left angular gyrus is damaged, then both reading and writing will be affected <span class="italic">(alexia with agraphia).</span> Such patients also often have acalculia, right–left confusion, and finger agnosia <span class="italic">(Gerstmann syndrome).</span></p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Cerebral achromatopsia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Color discrimination may be abnormal with bilateral inferior occipitotemporal lobe lesions (lingual and fusiform gyrus; see Chapter&#160;1). Affected patients cannot match colors or order them according to hue. Bilateral occipital ventromedial cortex damage may cause complete achromatopsia. Unilateral damage may cause only hemiachromatopsia. Accompanying superior homonymous visual field defects are often present.</p>
			<p class="h2">Disorders of Visual-Spatial Relationships</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Simultanagnosia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Simultanagnosia, which is the failure to integrate multiple elements of a scene to form the total picture, can be assessed by asking patients to describe a picture scene (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-2</span>). A patient with simultanagnosia will describe only part of the picture and not the other portions unless the examiner identifies them. Testing color vision with the Ishihara pseudoisochromatic color plates may suggest simultanagnosia if the patient can identify colors but not the shapes of numbers (ie, the patient does not see the whole picture as the sum of its parts).</p>
			<p class="h3">Balint syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Balint syndrome is a rare phenomenon resulting from bilateral occipitoparietal lesions and consists of the triad of simultanagnosia, optic ataxia (disconnection between visual input and the motor system), and acquired ocular motor apraxia (loss of voluntary movement of the eyes while fixating on a target). Clinically, this triad of findings rarely occurs together.</p>
			<p class="h3">Visual allesthesia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with visual allesthesia see their environment as rotated, flipped, or inverted. These symptoms localize the lesion to either the lateral medullary region <span class="italic">(Wallenberg syndrome)</span> or the occipitoparietal area.</p>
			<p class="h2">Disorders of Awareness of Vision or Visual Deficit</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Anton syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with Anton syndrome characteristically have cortical blindness but deny having any visual problem. These patients have no demonstrable visual behavior, but they hallucinate and confabulate visual images, claiming the ability to see. Anton syndrome is most common with bilateral occipital infarctions but has been described with blindness from bilateral optic nerve lesions.</p>
			<p class="h3">Riddoch phenomenon</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Preservation of the perception of motion in a blind hemifield is termed staticokinetic dissociation, or the Riddoch phenomenon. When present in an otherwise complete homonymous hemianopia, it is thought to portend a better visual prognosis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Blindsight</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cortically blind patients may have an unconscious rudimentary visual perception (blindsight). This condition manifests in the presence of damage to retrogeniculocalcarine visual pathways.</p>
			<p class="h3">Hemispatial neglect</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with hemispatial neglect (hemineglect) will not acknowledge seeing objects in one hemifield (usually the left) if presented with simultaneous stimuli in both hemifields; however, they will see the stimulus if it is presented in that hemifield alone. Confrontation visual field testing using double simultaneous stimulation may be used to verify this condition (see Chapter&#160;3). Hemispatial neglect usually results from damage in the right hemisphere (eg, the posterior parietal cortex, frontal eye fields, cingulate gyrus) that mediates attention in both hemifields.</p>
