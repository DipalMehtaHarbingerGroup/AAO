			<p class="chapter-title">The Patient With Supranuclear Disorders of Ocular Motility</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">efferent visual system,</span> the anatomy of which is introduced in Chapter&#160;1, controls ocular movements. Like all efferent nervous systems, the ocular motor system consists of supranuclear and infranuclear pathways. The supranuclear pathways originate from multiple locations and innervate the cranial nerve (CN) nuclei. <span class="italic">Prenuclear</span> is a more accurate term than <span class="italic">supranuclear</span> because some of these pathways (eg, the vestibular pathways) originate below the CN nuclei. However, the term <span class="italic">supranuclear</span> is used throughout the literature and will be used in this chapter as well.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The infranuclear pathways originate in the CN nuclei and innervate the extraocular muscles. The distinction between the supranuclear and infranuclear pathways is clinically important because supranuclear disorders almost always affect both eyes similarly, whereas infranuclear disorders affect each eye differently. The patterns of symmetric dysfunction that occur with supranuclear disorders typically do not produce diplopia, although exceptions such as skew deviation exist. Conversely, infranuclear lesions usually do produce diplopia.</p>

			<p class="h1">Fundamental Principles of Ocular Motor Control</p>
				<div id="Chapt8_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In primates, the afferent visual system is broadly designed to achieve 2&#160;fundamental goals: (1)&#160;to detect objects and motion in the environment and (2)&#160;to provide a high level of spatial resolution for objects that command attention. The entire retina outside the fovea is essentially devoted to the detection of objects. Only the fovea, which occupies a tiny fraction of the total retinal area, provides the fine-&#173;quality resolution that allows us to read or to perform highly precise visual motor tasks. Therefore, if one is to discern the fine details of an object, the image of that object must be precisely located on the fovea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ocular motor system directs and holds the fovea in alignment with objects of interest. Six supranuclear ocular motor systems have evolved to meet this challenge (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;8-1</span>):</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-2">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="italic">Ocular fixation system.</span> Holds the image of a stationary object on the fovea when the head is not moving</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;2.&#9;<span class="italic">Vestibular-&#173;ocular system.</span> Holds the image steady on the fovea during brief head movements</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;3.&#9;<span class="italic">Optokinetic system.</span> Holds the image on the fovea during sustained head movements</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;4.&#9;<span class="italic">Saccadic system.</span> Rapidly brings the image of an object of interest onto the fovea</p>

			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-3">&#9;6.&#9;<span class="italic">Vergence system.</span> Moves the eyes in opposite directions so that an image of an object of interest is simultaneously held on each fovea</p>
			<p class="body-text">These supranuclear systems are controlled by different anatomical pathways that converge at the level of the brainstem to innervate the ocular motor CN nuclei. Their separate origins allow selective disruption of these ocular motor systems by disease processes. Therefore, targeted clinical examination of these systems allows the clinician to identify the affected system and determine the responsible disease process.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Supranuclear Ocular Motor Systems: Function, Anatomy, Clinical Testing, and Disorders of Eye Movements</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinical examination of the supranuclear systems includes assessment of ocular fixation, vestibular-&#173;ocular reflex (VOR), optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), saccadic and pursuit eye movements, and convergence (see Table&#160;8-1). Each of these movements is controlled by dedicated anatomical pathways, the collective goals of which are to direct and maintain the image of a target of interest on the fovea. Methods of assessing each subsystem and signs of malfunction are described in the following sections. A thorough assessment of ocular motility also requires a search for nystagmus (see Chapter&#160;9). Videos of many of the supranuclear ocular motility disorders discussed in this chapter are available at the NOVEL (Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology Virtual Education Library) website at <a href="http://novel.utah.edu">http://novel<br />.utah.edu</a>.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Ocular Fixation System</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ocular fixation system holds the image of a stationary object on the fovea when the head is immobile. Eye movement recordings show that the eye is not completely still during ocular fixation; subclinical eye movements prevent attenuation of neuronal responses in the retina. A basic principle of all sensory systems is that any persistent, unchanging stimulus gradually produces an attenuated neural response. This phenomenon explains, for instance, why one does not attend to the constant tactile stimulus of wearing clothing or a wristwatch.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The degradation of image quality that would result if the eye was completely still is countered by <span class="italic">microsaccadic refixation movements. </span>These eye movements are continuous, very small amplitude (0.1°–0.2° of visual angle) square waves. The term <span class="italic">square waves</span> derives from the appearance of eye movement tracings, in which eye movements of equal amplitude and speed to the left and right have a brief intersaccadic interval that produces tracings in the shape of square waves (see Chapter&#160;9). The to-and-fro movements are small enough that the image is maintained within the field of the fovea but large enough to provide a constantly changing image to photoreceptors, thereby enhancing perceptual quality. As is true for most saccadic movements, there is a slight pause (180–200&#160;milliseconds) between movements, known as an <span class="italic">intersaccadic <br />interval.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">The anatomic pathways that control ocular fixation include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the supplementary eye field, the parietal eye field, regions V5 and V5a, the basal ganglia, and the superior colliculi. Clinical evaluation of ocular stability involves observing the patient’s ability to fixate on a target when the head and body are held stationary.</p>
			<p class="h3">Ocular fixation dysfunction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Malfunction of other ocular motor systems may disrupt steady fixation. Saccadic eye movements that disrupt fixation are referred to as <span class="italic">saccadic intrusions</span> (see Chapter&#160;9). Saccadic intrusions are of brief duration, quite rapid, and in most cases small amplitude. The most common intrusions are <span class="italic">square-wave jerks (SWJs),</span> which lead the eyes off and then back onto the target with symmetric movements (amplitude of 0.5°–3° of visual angle). Infrequent SWJs (4–6&#160;per minute) may be observed in patients with normal vision. Frequent SWJs (&gt;15&#160;per minute) are pathologic and occur in patients with <span class="italic">progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)</span> or certain cerebellar diseases. They may also be seen in patients who smoke cigarettes. Other examples of saccadic intrusions include ocular flutter and opsoclonus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sustained slow eye movements that disrupt fixation characterize nystagmus, which is often caused by an imbalance of vestibular input to the ocular motor nuclei. A continuous slow eye movement that displaces the eye off fixation, followed by a corrective saccade, is referred to as a <span class="italic">jerk nystagmus.</span> A continuous slow eye movement that oscillates around fixation without a corrective saccade is referred to as a <span class="italic">pendular nystagmus</span> (see Chapter&#160;9).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Vestibular-Ocular System (Vestibular-Ocular Reflex)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The VOR holds foveal alignment on a target of interest during brief, high-&#173;frequency head movements by generating ocular rotations of equal speed, and in the opposite direction, as that of the head movements. VOR responses are driven by the labyrinth, which is composed of 3&#160;semicircular canals and the otoliths (the utricle and saccule). The labyrinth contains hair cells with cilia that project into the endolymph fluid. Head movement causes endolymph flow that deflects cilia on the hair cells, subsequently altering the neurologic activity of CN&#160;VIII. The semicircular canals respond to head rotation, and the otoliths respond to linear head movements and static head tilt. Neural activity (excitatory and inhibitory) from these structures passes along the vestibular nerves to synapses in the CN&#160;VIII nuclei in the medulla of the brainstem; from there, the activity projects to the ocular motor nuclei (ie, the VOR pathway; see Chapter&#160;1). CN&#160;VIII nuclei have many interconnections with the cerebellum that “fine-tune” the VOR.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Each semicircular canal responds to head movements and governs ocular rotations within the same plane as the canal. In addition, each semicircular canal responds in opposite ways to head movements in each direction within the plane of the canal. Thus, the right horizontal semicircular canal stimulates right CN&#160;VIII discharge in response to rightward head rotation and inhibits right CN&#160;VIII discharge in response to leftward head rotation. Conversely, the left horizontal semicircular canal excites the left CN&#160;VIII in response to leftward head rotation and inhibits the left CN&#160;VIII in response to rightward head rotation. This arrangement results in a “push–pull” relationship between the paired canals in which stimulation from 1&#160;canal occurs with inhibition from the contralateral, paired canal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Stimulation from the horizontal semicircular canal projects via the CN&#160;VIII nucleus to the contralateral CN&#160;VI nucleus, resulting in horizontal ocular rotations away from the side of the canal. For example, stimulating the right horizontal semicircular canal generates left gaze. Together, the horizontal canals generate horizontal ocular rotations that are equal in speed and opposite in direction to horizontal head rotation. For example, rightward head rotation stimulates the right horizontal semicircular canal (and inhibits the left horizontal semicircular canal) to generate leftward ocular rotations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The anterior semicircular canals stimulate upgaze (in response to downward head rotation), and the posterior canals stimulate downgaze (in response to upward head rotation). The anterior and posterior canals also stimulate contralateral torsion in response to dynamic ipsilateral head tilt.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sustained head rotation stimulates the VOR to generate slow-phase ocular movements that are <span class="italic">opposite the direction</span> of head rotation (to maintain fixation); these alternate with fast-phase, reflexive, refixation saccades <span class="italic">in the direction</span> of head rotation (VOR nystagmus). The VOR response to sustained head rotation attenuates fairly quickly as the cilia on the hair cells resume their normal position. However, a “velocity storage” mechanism prolongs the VOR for several seconds during sustained head movements. This velocity storage mechanism is generated by interconnections within the CN&#160;VIII nuclei (the vestibular commissure) and is fine-tuned and stabilized by connections with the cerebellum.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The otoliths (saccule and utricle) respond to linear head movement and static head tilt. Head tilt stimulates a response that improves ocular orientation with the horizontal plane. Thus, rightward head tilt stimulates the right otolith to generate compensatory elevation and intorsion of the right eye and depression and extorsion of the left eye. Conversely, leftward head tilt stimulates the left otolith to generate compensatory elevation and intorsion of the left eye and depression and extorsion of the right eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Examination can readily elicit evidence of VOR dysfunction. Spontaneous nystagmus may be a sign of imbalanced vestibular input, resulting in a slow-phase gaze deviation that disrupts fixation, followed by a corrective saccade. Nystagmus can be detected by observation of the eyes as the patient fixates on a distant target with the head stationary. Subtle small-&#173;amplitude nystagmus can be detected by viewing the fundus with a direct ophthalmoscope while looking for repetitive shifts in the position of the optic nerve head. Note that the optic nerve head is behind the center of ocular rotation and will therefore beat in a direction opposite to that of the nystagmus. This test is first performed while the fellow eye is allowed to fixate on a target. Next, the effect of removing visual fixation (achieved by covering the fixating eye) is assessed. Fixation suppresses nystagmus from peripheral vestibular disorders; thus, the onset of nystagmus after removal of visual fixation suggests the presence of an imbalance of the peripheral vestibular system. In contrast, nystagmus from central vestibular disorders is not altered by fixation and will therefore be observed with or without fixation (see Chapter&#160;9).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The VOR gain (ie, the ratio of the amplitude of eye rotation to the amplitude of head rotation) can be assessed clinically with the head thrust maneuver, which requires the clinician to turn the patient’s head briskly while the patient fixates on a target. Normally, if the head is rotated 10°, the eyes will rotate exactly 10° in the opposite direction, with equal speed, to maintain foveation of a stationary target. Any imbalance in the VOR gain results in the eyes being dragged off target at the end of the head thrust, followed by a refixation saccade to recapture the target. The horizontal semicircular canals are evaluated by horizontal head rotation. When the head is rotated toward the side of the lesion, a defective response is observed. For example, rightward head rotation should stimulate the right horizontal semicircular canal to generate leftward ocular rotations of equal speed and amplitude. If a lesion is present in the right horizontal semicircular canal pathway, the eyes will be dragged off target, followed by a leftward, compensatory, refixation saccade. The anterior and posterior semicircular canals can be assessed by vertical head rotations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">VOR gain may also be tested by measuring visual acuity during head rotations <span class="italic">(</span><span class="italic">dy</span><span class="italic">namic visual acuity)</span>. Relatively small horizontal or vertical head rotations at approximately 2&#160;Hz are performed while the patient reads the Snellen chart. In a patient with normal VOR gain, visual acuity will decrease by 1&#160;or 2&#160;lines at most. Abnormal VOR gain will produce a mismatch between the amplitude of the eye and head movements, causing the intended target to drift off the fovea, resulting in a decrease in visual acuity by several lines (typically 4 or more).</p>
			<p class="h3">Vestibular-ocular dysfunction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eye movement abnormalities can develop from either peripheral or central disruptions of vestibular activity, although peripheral end-&#173;organ disease of the semicircular canals is by far the most common cause of such abnormalities. Patients with vestibular disease often have nystagmus and abnormal VOR gain (see Chapter&#160;9).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Otolith dysfunction may produce skew deviation or an ocular tilt reaction. <span class="italic">Skew deviation</span> is a vertical misalignment of the eyes caused by asymmetrical otolithic input to the ocular motor nuclei. The vertical misalignment, which may be comitant or incomitant, may simulate a CN&#160;IV palsy, including a positive head tilt test. However, skew deviation typically occurs with intorsion of the hypertropic eye. In contrast, CN&#160;IV palsy causes extorsion of the hypertropic eye. Additionally, the vertical deviation in skew deviation typically improves when the patient lies down, whereas it does not change in CN&#160;IV palsy. An alternating skew deviation manifests as hypertropia of the abducting eye (ie, right hypertropia on right gaze and left hypertropia on left gaze).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">ocular tilt reaction,</span> which occurs with otolithic imbalance, consists of a head tilt, skew deviation, and cyclotorsional rotation of the eyes (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-1</span>). As described earlier, normally, the otoliths <span class="italic">respond</span> to head tilt to improve ocular orientation with the horizontal plane (eg, a right head tilt stimulates the right otolith, resulting in elevation and intorsion of the right eye, and depression and extorsion of the left eye). However, a lesion that decreases innervation from the left otolith (resulting in a pathologic relative increase in innervation from the right otolith) will <span class="italic">drive</span> the head tilt and generate a left head tilt, elevation and intorsion of the right eye, and depression and extorsion of the left eye (left ocular tilt reaction). The subjective visual vertical may be tilted in the direction of the ocular rotation, although the patient may not recognize that such a shift has occurred.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Skew deviation and the ocular tilt reaction are caused by peripheral or central nervous system (CNS) lesions. A peripheral lesion will generally be ipsilateral to the hypotropic eye (eg, a left otolith lesion is associated with left hypotropic skew deviation or left ocular tilt reaction). However, otolithic innervation crosses within the CNS and projects to multiple ocular motor nuclei, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, and the cerebellum. Thus, skew deviation and the ocular tilt reaction do not localize dysfunction to a specific region of the CNS and may be caused by lesions anywhere in the brainstem or cerebellum (eg, the posterior fossa) that result in asymmetric otolithic input to the ocular motor nuclei.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vestibular imbalance is common with lesions of the caudal brainstem (lower pons and medulla) because of disruption to the CN&#160;VIII nuclei or their interconnections. One of the better-&#173;known stroke syndromes involving this area is the <span class="italic">lateral medullary syndrome</span> (or <span class="italic">Wallenberg syndrome</span>). In general, damage to a lateral region of the brainstem disrupts the sensory pathways; therefore, Wallenberg syndrome is a type of “stroke without paralysis” (see Chapter&#160;2, Fig&#160;2-6). Patients may present with the following signs and symptoms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-7">ipsilateral loss of facial pain and temperature sensation (involvement of the descending tract of CN&#160;V)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">contralateral loss of hemibody pain and temperature sensation (involvement of the lateral spinothalamic tract)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ipsilateral cerebellar ataxia (damage to spinocerebellar tracts)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ipsilateral first-order Horner syndrome</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-8">ipsilateral ocular tilt reaction (head tilt toward the side of the lesion)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition, patients may have dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, or persistent hiccups; there is no extremity weakness.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the lateral medulla is in the distribution of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), Wallenberg syndrome usually results from occlusion of the more proximal vertebral artery. Consequently, patients may experience <span class="italic">lateropulsion,</span> the sensation of being pulled toward the side of the lesion, which results from damage to the CN&#160;VIII nuclei. Patients may also manifest <span class="italic">ocular lateropulsion;</span> this effect can be tested by examination of horizontal pursuit and saccadic movements, which will reveal a bias that produces hypermetric movements toward the side of the lesion and hypometric movements away from the side of the lesion. Vertical saccades may follow an elliptical path as the eyes deviate toward the side of the lesion during the vertical movement. Finally, this directional bias also can be observed by noting that the eyes turn toward the side of the lesion after visual fixation is removed for a few seconds.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Optokinetic System (Optokinetic Nystagmus)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">optokinetic system</span> maintains steady alignment of images on the retina during <span class="italic">sustained</span> rotation of the head (or environment). OKN is induced when a large visual image sweeps across the retina. The initial response is a slow-phase, pursuit-&#173;like movement that follows the visual scene, followed by a contraversive, involuntary, reflexive saccade. The VOR generates similar reflexive eye movements. However, the vestibular response is generated by brief head rotations that stimulate the semicircular canals and is attenuated after approximately 30&#160;seconds as the cilia on the hair cells resume their normal position. In contrast, the optokinetic system response is a sustained response that is generated by continuous visual image motion over a large area of retina.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The vestibular and optokinetic systems act synergistically to hold the visual scene steady on the retina during sustained head rotations. For example, when a normal subject is rotated, the VOR initially stimulates the slow-phase ocular rotations in the opposite direction that hold the visual image steady on the retina. However, after approximately 30&#160;seconds, the rotation-&#173;induced VOR is attenuated. Thereafter, the optokinetic system responds to the visual scene sweeping across the retina by providing a sustained output, which generates continuous ocular movements that hold the visual image steady on the retina.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The smooth-&#173;pursuit system and the optokinetic system are similar but distinct. The smooth-&#173;pursuit system is voluntarily activated; its function is to place the image of a small moving object onto the fovea. In contrast, the optokinetic system is involuntary and is reflexively activated when a large visual image sweeps across a large area of retina.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The optokinetic system cannot be isolated for testing in the clinical setting. In order to do so, the moving stimulus would have to fill the complete visual environment. Although practical, OKN induced by the rotating OKN drum of black-and-white stripes that clinicians use in the office subtends only a portion of the visual field and primarily tests the pursuit and saccade systems, not the optokinetic system.</p>
			<p class="h3">Optokinetic nystagmus dysfunction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Isolating the optokinetic system response from the pursuit response to a moving target requires specialized testing equipment not typically used in the clinical setting. As noted, the OKN drum subtends a small portion of the visual field and therefore primarily tests smooth-&#173;pursuit movements in the direction of drum rotation and saccadic eye movements opposite the direction of drum rotation (eg, drum rotation toward the patient’s right side generates a rightward ocular pursuit movement followed by a leftward saccade.)</p>
			<p class="body-text">Asymmetry of the OKN drum–induced responses can be caused by a unilateral lesion of the cerebral pathways that descend from the ipsilateral parietal, middle temporal, or medial superior temporal areas to the brainstem ocular motor centers. These regions control ipsilateral smooth pursuit. Therefore, abnormal, jerky pursuits (ie, saccadic pursuits) will occur when the drum is rotated toward the side of the lesion. Asymmetry of OKN responses, with normal smooth-&#173;pursuit movements produced by drum rotation toward the patient’s left and abnormal saccadic pursuit movements produced by drum rotation toward the patient’s right, suggests a lesion in the right cerebrum. Typically, relatively large lesions of the parietal or parieto-&#173;occipital cortex are required to produce drum-&#173;induced asymmetries; these lesions are usually accompanied by a homonymous hemianopia. A lesion confined to the occipital lobe (eg, as usually occurs secondary to a stroke within the distribution of the posterior cerebral artery) also produces a homonymous hemianopia but not OKN asymmetry. Thus, the clinician may use the OKN drum to gain insight into the location and extent of a cerebral lesion that produces a homonymous hemianopia.</p>
			<p class="h2">Saccadic System</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The saccadic system rapidly shifts the fovea to targets of interest. Saccades are ballistic, rapid movements that generally cannot be altered once initiated. The speed of saccades correlates with the extent of eye movement; larger-&#173;amplitude saccades are faster than smaller-&#173;amplitude saccades. This relationship is referred to as the <span class="italic">main sequence.</span> Saccadic velocity may exceed 500° per second, a speed that allows the eyes to move from primary position to the farthest extent of the temporal visual field in only 0.2&#160;second. Saccadic latency (the interval between appearance of a target and onset of a saccade) is approximately 200&#160;milliseconds, and saccadic duration is generally less than 100&#160;milliseconds.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Saccades may be volitional or reflexive (as in the reflexive quick phases of optokinetic and vestibular nystagmus). Volitional saccades are controlled by several areas of the cerebral cortex, including premotor zones that project to the <span class="italic">frontal eye fields (FEFs)</span> (see Chapter&#160;1). Descending pathways from the FEFs also communicate with several intermediate structures, including the basal ganglia and superior colliculi. Reflexive saccades are controlled primarily by the superior colliculi. Activation of these pathways generates conjugate, contralateral saccades by innervating the contralateral PPRF. The PPRF contains 2&#160;populations of neurons: (1)&#160;<span class="italic">burst cells</span> that activate the neighboring CN&#160;VI nucleus and (2)&#160;<span class="italic">omnipause cells</span> that inhibit the burst cells. The FEFs and superior colliculi generate a saccade by stimulating the burst cells and inhibiting the omnipause cells within the contralateral PPRF. The PPRF burst cells project to the adjacent CN&#160;VI nucleus that innervates the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle and, via the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), the contralateral medial rectus muscle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The PPRF generates saccades via 2&#160;innervational components: (1)&#160;a pulse and (2)&#160;a step (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-2</span>). The <span class="italic">pulse</span> initiates the saccade with a burst of high-&#173;frequency, phasic innervational activity that enables the globe to overcome inertia and the viscous drag of the orbit (gaze initiation). The <span class="italic">step</span> consists of tonic innervational activity that continues after the saccadic eye movement is complete in order to hold the eye in its new eccentric position against elastic forces in the orbit (gaze holding). The pulse determines saccade velocity, and the step maintains the position of the eye after the saccade. For the saccade to be accurate, the velocity of the saccade (pulse innervation) must match the final ocular position maintained after the saccade is complete (step innervation). The process of matching the pulse and step components of a saccade is referred to as <span class="italic">neural integration.</span> For horizontal movements, the neural integrator consists of the medial CN&#160;VIII nucleus and the accessory nucleus of CN&#160;XII (also known as the <span class="italic">nucleus prepositus hypoglossi [NPH]</span>) in the medulla. The PPRF contains neurons that project directly to the CN&#160;VI nucleus as well as neurons that project to the neural integrator prior to innervating the CN&#160;VI nucleus, enabling pulse–step integration of horizontal saccades.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The FEFs and the superior colliculi generate volitional and reflexive vertical saccades, respectively, via bilateral descending pathways that project to the <span class="italic">rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF)</span>. The riMLF, which is located in the midbrain, is the supranuclear brainstem center for control of conjugate vertical and torsional saccadic eye movements. Neural integration of vertical saccades occurs in the nearby <span class="italic">interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC),</span> which matches phasic pulse innervation (gaze initiation) with tonic step innervation (gaze holding) in order to hold the eyes in the proper vertical eccentric position after completion of the saccade; note that this structure is the homologue of the NPH, which performs the neural integration for control of horizontal eye movements. Thus, the riMLF contains burst-cell neurons that project directly to the CN&#160;III and CN&#160;IV nuclei as well as neurons that project to the INC prior to innervating these nuclei, enabling pulse–step integration of vertical saccades.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Saccadic eye movements are fine-tuned by the cerebellum, which receives neural input from the pons and supplies innervation to the PPRF and riMLF. The cerebellum influences saccadic speed and accuracy and assists in neural integration (pulse–step matching).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Volitional saccades can be tested by having the patient rapidly shift gaze between 2&#160;targets, such as the extended index fingers of the clinician’s outstretched hands, which are held to the left and right of the patient. Reflexive saccades are tested by observing the quick phases of OKN (elicited by patient fixation on a rotating OKN drum) and vestibular nystagmus (elicited by patient rotation in an examination chair). The <span class="italic">latency</span> (duration from stimulus to movement), <span class="italic">accuracy</span> (arrival of the eyes on target), <span class="italic">velocity,</span> and <span class="italic">conjugacy</span> (degree to which the 2&#160;eyes move together) of the movements should be monitored. A <span class="italic">hypometric saccade</span> falls short of the intended target; 1–2&#160;small catch-up saccades may be within normal limits. A <span class="italic">hypermetric</span> <span class="italic">saccade</span> overshoots the target and is usually pathologic.</p>
			<p class="h3">Saccadic dysfunction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Saccadic disorders may produce involuntary saccades, reduced speed of saccades, poor accuracy of saccades (ie, hypometria or hypermetria), delayed latency to initiate saccades, or the inability to maintain eccentric gaze after completion of a saccade. The specific saccadic disorder relates to the pattern of neural activity delivered to the ocular motor nuclei. Excessive firing of burst cells (or excessive inhibition of omnipause cells) in the PPRF will cause unwanted, involuntary saccadic intrusions that disrupt fixation (see the section “Ocular fixation dysfunction” earlier in this chapter, and Chapter&#160;9).</p>
			<p class="body-text">When a patient appears unable to initiate saccades, the doll’s head maneuver can determine whether this inability is the result of a supranuclear or nuclear/infranuclear lesion. In a patient with a supranuclear lesion that causes a horizontal saccadic gaze deficit, the doll’s head maneuver will activate the intact vestibular-&#173;ocular system, bypassing the PPRF and directly stimulating the CN&#160;VI nucleus to induce horizontal gaze. Conversely, a CN&#160;VI nuclear lesion will impair horizontal gaze in response to the doll’s head maneuver as well as attempted volitional saccades.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Slow saccades can result from central or peripheral lesions (including nuclear and infranuclear lesions). Peripheral lesions almost always produce slowed saccadic movements that are hypometric. In contrast, slow saccades with normal amplitude are typically due to CNS lesions, especially lesions of the cerebral hemispheres or basal ganglia. Irrespective of the location of a CNS lesion, slowed saccades ultimately result from decreased discharge frequency of burst-cell neurons causing a deficit in phasic innervation (the pulse component) of the saccade. Saccadic slowness confined to the horizontal plane suggests dysfunction of the PPRF in the pons, whereas saccadic slowness confined to the vertical plane suggests dysfunction of the riMLF in the midbrain. Patients with PSP have slow volitional saccades, especially in the vertical plane, but their reflexive saccades (the fast phases of OKN) often are initially normal. Other CNS disorders that cause slow saccades include cerebellar degeneration, Huntington disease, Wilson disease, and Whipple disease. Most of these cases typically include a prolonged latency to initiate saccades. Myasthenia gravis may produce faster-than-&#173;normal (“lightning-&#173;like”) saccades that suddenly stop short of the intended target (reduced saccadic amplitude).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Dysmetric saccades result from peripheral lesions or from abnormal discharge duration of the burst-cell neurons responsible for phasic innervation (the pulse component) of the saccade. Hypometric saccades can be observed with peripheral or central lesions, whereas hypermetric saccades are usually the result of disease of the cerebellum or its interconnections. The accuracy of saccadic eye movements can be difficult to assess in patients with significant bilateral loss of vision, especially those with large visual field defects (eg, homonymous hemianopia and bitemporal hemianopia). Thus, the clinician should exercise caution in describing the presence of hypometric saccades in these patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In other cases, saccades are initiated only after prolonged latency, which is a characteristic feature of ocular motor apraxia (discussed later in this chapter). Assessment of saccadic latency must take into account the patient’s age; a gradual increase in latency may occur with advancing age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The inability to maintain eccentric gaze after completion of a saccade is a result of decreased tonic innervation (the step component of a saccade). Insufficient tonic innervation arises from infranuclear lesions, cerebellar disease, or malfunction of the neural integrator, often referred to as a leaky integrator (the neural integrator consists of the NPH for horizontal saccades and the INC for vertical saccades). After completion of the saccade, the deficient tonic innervation causes the eyes to drift slowly off of the target back to the central position, followed by a corrective saccade toward the target. This combination of eye movements is known as <span class="italic">gaze-evoked nystagmus</span> (see Chapter&#160;9).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common saccadic dysfunction—the conjugate limitation of upgaze characterized by eye movements that have reduced range but normal velocity—is part of normal aging. Abnormalities of saccadic function are relatively nonspecific with regard to etiology and site of the lesion, but notable exceptions occur in which saccadic abnormalities provide important clues to the diagnosis. These exceptions include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">slowed saccades in a patient with extrapyramidal (ie, Parkinson-&#173;like) syndrome with imbalance and impaired cognition, which suggest a diagnosis of PSP</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">hypermetric saccades, which usually indicate disease of the cerebellum or its outflow pathways</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">unidirectional hypermetric saccades, ocular lateropulsion, and hypermetric pursuit movements, which are generally present as part of the lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-11"><span class="h4-head">Ocular motor apraxia</span> An extreme instance of saccadic dysfunction is ocular motor apraxia. An <span class="italic">apraxia</span> is an inability to voluntarily initiate a movement that can be initiated by another means, which reveals that a paralysis is not present.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Ocular motor apraxia in children</span> is characterized by increased latency or failure of saccadic initiation. Voluntary and reflexive saccades (in response to OKN and VOR) are affected. Horizontal OKN drum rotation induces lateral gaze in the direction of drum rotation, as slow-phase pursuit movements are relatively intact. However, the failure to generate saccades consistently results in the eyes getting “locked up” in lateral gaze. Saccades, once generated, are often hypometric.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Congenital ocular motor apraxia</span> (as described by Cogan) is idiopathic and is characterized by increased latency and intermittent failure of horizontal saccadic initiation. Vertical eye movements are normal. Children with congenital ocular motor apraxia characteristically use horizontal head thrusts past the point of interest, employing the VOR to move the eyes into extreme contraversion until foveation on the target is possible; this maneuver is followed by slower head rotation in the opposite direction to primary position while the eyes maintain target fixation. Older patients use subtle head movements and blinking to generate saccades. Infants with congenital ocular motor apraxia may be misperceived as having poor vision because they cannot initiate saccades to fixate objects, and they do not yet have the head control to utilize head thrusts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The location of the lesion that causes congenital ocular motor apraxia is not known. Saccades, once initiated, are of normal velocity and often hypometric; however, normal-&#173;velocity, large-&#173;amplitude saccades are occasionally generated, indicating that the burst-cell neurons are intact and that the lesion is therefore proximal to the PPRF. Patients with this condition may have other neurologic abnormalities, including mild developmental delay. Neuroimaging may be normal, although multiple abnormalities of uncertain significance, most commonly cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, have been described. Most cases are sporadic, although familial inheritance (autosomal dominant and recessive) has been reported.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular motor apraxia in children is associated with several diseases, including ataxia telangiectasia, Joubert syndrome, Pelizaeus-&#173;Merzbacher disease, Niemann-&#173;Pick disease type&#160;C, Gaucher disease, Tay-Sachs disease, abetalipoproteinemia (which causes vitamin&#160;E deficiency), and Wilson disease. In these cases, both vertical and horizontal saccades are affected. Head thrusting is present in approximately half of these cases. Other signs that should prompt a search for an associated disease include nystagmus, skew deviation, retinal pigment epithelial changes, ataxia, seizures, and progressive developmental delay. If these signs are present, a workup should include neuroimaging, an electroretinogram, and genetic evaluation.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Acquired ocular motor apraxia in adults</span> results from bilateral lesions of the supranuclear gaze pathways of the frontal and parietal lobes, usually caused by bilateral strokes, often as part of an anoxic encephalopathy following either cardiac arrest or coronary artery bypass grafting. This condition has also been observed after thoracic aortic aneurysm repair. Patients are unable to initiate voluntary saccades (horizontal and vertical) and often blink to break the fixation and then turn their head toward a new point of interest. Reflexive saccades are intact. Bilateral lesions at the parieto-&#173;occipital junction may impair the guidance of volitional saccades. Such inaccurate saccades, together with <span class="italic">optic ataxia</span> (inaccurate arm pointing; eg, when a patient misdirects his or her hand when attempting to shake yours, despite being able to see your hand) and <span class="italic">simultanagnosia</span> (disordered visual attention that makes it difficult for a patient to perceive all the major features of a scene at once) are known as <span class="italic">Balint syndrome;</span> this syndrome is often associated with cognitive dysfunction (see Chapter&#160;6).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Smooth-Pursuit System</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The smooth-pursuit system generates smooth conjugate eye movements that maintain the image of a moving target on the fovea. Pursuit eye movements are able to track a moving target both when the head is immobile and when it is in motion. In order to perform the latter function, the pursuit system must override the VOR. For example, rightward head rotation stimulates the VOR to move the eyes in the opposite direction, toward the left. Therefore, in order to track a rightward-&#173;moving object with simultaneous rightward head rotation, the pursuit system (which tracks the object by moving the eyes toward the right) must cancel the VOR (which drives the eyes in the opposite direction, toward the left).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pursuit movements cannot be generated without a moving target; attempts to pursue an imaginary target will result in a series of saccades. When a patient tracks an object, the moving target generates signals from the M ganglion cells in the retina that are relayed through the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus to the striate cortex (V1), and from there to the extrastriate cortex (V2, V3). These signals are subsequently relayed to the middle temporal (MT) area (where neurons preferentially respond to the speed and direction of moving stimuli), the medial superior temporal (MST) area, the posterior parietal cortex, and the FEF. The MT and MST areas are part of the <span class="italic">dorsal visual processing stream,</span> which plays an important role in detecting moving visual stimuli (see Chapter&#160;1, Fig&#160;1-23). The descending cortical pathways of the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes converge and pass through the posterior limb of the internal capsule to innervate the ipsilateral dorsal lateral pontine nucleus (DLPN). The pathway that follows the DLPN comprises 2&#160;decussations. First, the neurons in the DLPN decussate and project to the contralateral cerebellar lobe (the first decussation), which in turn innervates the medial CN&#160;VIII nucleus. Thereafter, neurons in the medial vestibular nucleus decussate and project to the contralateral CN&#160;VI nucleus (the second decussation). The CN&#160;VI nucleus initiates conjugate horizontal eye movements by innervating the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle and, via internuclear neurons that travel in the MLF, the contralateral medial rectus muscle. Thus, the cortical regions control ipsilateral pursuit movements as a result of the double decussation pathway. Vertical pursuit movements are generated by similar pathways that ultimately stimulate CN&#160;III and CN&#160;IV.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinicians test pursuit eye movements by having the patient’s eyes follow a predictably slow-&#173;moving target horizontally and then vertically while the head and body are held in position. Two main types of pursuit dysfunction occur: (1)&#160;abnormal gain and (2)&#160;delayed initiation. The gain of pursuit eye movements should be 1—that is, the eyes should accurately follow the slow-&#173;moving stimulus. A low gain results in eye movements that trail the target (ie, the motor output is not commensurate with the speed of the moving target), which prompts initiation of catch-up saccades to maintain visual fixation. This combination of too-slow pursuit movements with interposed saccades is called <span class="italic">cogwheel,</span> or <span class="italic">saccadic, pursuit</span>. Conversely, a high gain causes the eyes to pursue ahead of the target, which prompts backup saccades.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The OKN drum can be used to evaluate smooth pursuit. The smooth-&#173;pursuit system generates the eye movements that follow the rotating lines on the OKN drum. Pursuit movements toward the side of drum rotation should be accurate without saccadic interruptions. The OKN drum should be rotated to each side to evaluate the symmetry of the pursuit response.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The smooth-pursuit system can also be evaluated by testing VOR cancellation. This is assessed by having the patient fixate on a target (his thumb or a near card) in his outstretched hand while he is rotated from side to side in the examination chair. The patient’s head, the target, and the chair rotate in the same direction as a unit. If the smooth-&#173;pursuit system cancels the VOR, the patient will maintain fixation on the target during chair rotation. If the smooth-&#173;pursuit system does not cancel the VOR, the VOR will drive the eyes off target in the direction opposite of the chair rotation, followed by a corrective saccade. For example, a patient with intact VOR cancellation will maintain fixation on his thumb during rightward chair rotation. If there is inadequate VOR cancellation, the VOR will rotate the eyes off of the thumb to the left in response to rightward rotation. This will be followed by a rightward corrective saccade, which indicates low pursuit gain to the right (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-3</span>). It is normal in such assessments for the patient to exhibit catch-up saccades during the first 4 or 5&#160;rotations but not thereafter.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Smooth-pursuit system dysfunction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Smooth-&#173;pursuit system dysfunction is of poor localizing value. Accompanying neurological abnormalities are often required to determine the location and etiology of the lesion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Abnormal gain is typically observed in older patients without other definable neurologic problems or secondary to use of a wide range of medications. With age, reduced gain decreases the smoothness of smooth pursuit, although obvious saccadic pursuit is pathologic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Large cerebral lesions that involve the frontal, parietal, or temporal lobe or the underlying white matter may cause decreased pursuit gain (saccadic pursuits) when the patient fixates on an object moving toward the side of the lesion. These lesions may cause an asymmetric OKN response, with abnormal saccadic pursuits in response to drum rotation toward the side of the lesion and normal smooth pursuits when the drum is rotated away from the side of the lesion. Occipital lobe lesions do not cause OKN asymmetry.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cerebellar disease of any etiology may cause saccadic pursuits and an inability to cancel the VOR, demonstrated by the chair rotation fixation test (see Fig&#160;8-3). Accompanying signs of cerebellar disease are often present.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Smooth-&#173;pursuit deficits are usually present in both horizontal and vertical planes, although the vertical plane may be involved selectively in patients with bilateral <span class="italic">internuclear ophthalmoplegia</span> or PSP.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Vergence System</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vergence eye movements slowly drive the eyes in opposite directions to maintain the image of an object on the fovea of both eyes as the object moves toward or away from the observer. Vergence stimuli include tonic vergence, fusional vergence, accommodative vergence, and voluntary vergence. Without innervation, the anatomy of the orbits creates a divergent misalignment of the eyes (as occurs during sleep or anesthesia). Thus, a baseline amount of <span class="italic">tonic vergence</span> is required to align the eyes in alert humans. <span class="italic">Fusional vergence</span> is driven by a disparity in the relative location of images on the retinas and realigns the lines of sight to achieve single binocular vision. <span class="italic">Accommodative vergence</span> is driven by retinal blur. As an object approaches the eye, retinal blur stimulates the near triad, which consists of accommodation, convergence, and pupillary constriction. Humans are also able to voluntarily stimulate the near triad <span class="italic">(voluntary vergence).</span> Clinically, the most important stimuli for vergence consist of retinal disparity <span class="italic">(</span><span class="italic">fusional vergence)</span> and retinal blur (<span class="italic">accommodative convergence,</span> as part of the near triad).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cerebral structures controlling vergence movements in primates are not well understood. Binocularly driven cortical cells in the occipital lobe as well as regions of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes innervate brainstem neurons located in the mesencephalic reticular formation just dorsal to the CN&#160;III nuclei (both directly and via the cerebellum). The mesencephalic reticular formation in turn innervates the medial rectus subnucleus of each CN&#160;III nucleus, resulting in convergence.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Convergence is tested with an accommodative target that has enough detail to require an effort to see it clearly (a penlight or finger is not adequate). Fusional and accommodative convergences are simultaneously evaluated by determining the near point of convergence (NPC). The patient fixates on a small accommodative target that is slowly brought toward the nose. The NPC is the distance at which fusion is not maintained and a divergent movement occurs. A normal NPC is approximately 3–5&#160;cm from the nose.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fusional convergence is measured by placing a <span class="italic">base-out prism</span> in front of 1&#160;eye while the patient fixates on a target, either near or at a distance. The prism strength is increased until diplopia occurs (ie, until fusion is broken). The strength of the prism at which diplopia occurs is the convergence amplitude. Divergence amplitudes are measured in a similar manner with <span class="italic">base-in prisms.</span> Normal convergence amplitudes are 25&#160;prism diopters (Δ) for distance fixation and 35Δ for near fixation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Accommodative convergence is measured by the accommodative convergence/accommodation ratio (AC/A ratio), using the <span class="italic">lens gradient method</span> or the <span class="italic">heterophoria method.</span> The lens gradient method entails performing the prism and alternate cover test to measure the ocular deviation with distance fixation. The test is repeated with a –2.00&#160;D lens placed in front of each eye. The change in the ocular deviation after lens placement (in prism diopters) is divided by 2 to determine the AC/A ratio. A normal AC/A ratio is 3–5&#160;Δ/D. The <span class="italic">heterophoria method</span> determines the AC/A ratio by the following formula:</p>
			<p class="equation-single ParaOverride-14">AC/A = pupillary distance (in centimeters) + (deviation near – deviation distance)/3.</p>
			<p class="h3">Vergence dysfunction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although vergence disorders are common, they can be challenging to diagnose because convergence depends strongly on patient effort. These disorders are frequently classified as convergence insufficiency, accommodative esotropia, convergence spasm, or divergence insufficiency. Unlike other supranuclear disorders, vergence disorders usually result in diplopic symptoms.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Convergence insufficiency</span> Convergence insufficiency (CI) consists of an exodeviation that is greater at near fixation than at distance fixation. It is a common cause of eye strain, headache, blurred vision, and intermittent diplopia during near-point tasks. Patients with CI have decreased convergence amplitudes and a remote NPC, often greater than 10&#160;cm. This condition often occurs as an isolated finding; in the absence of other neurologic symptoms, further workup is not needed. Nonetheless, many neurologic conditions are associated with CI, most notably closed head trauma and extrapyramidal disorders such as Parkinson disease and PSP. Lesions of the pretectal area may also be associated with CI; however, such lesions are typically accompanied by other features of dorsal midbrain syndrome (see the section Gaze Preference, Gaze Palsy, and Tonic Deviations). In rare instances, lesions of the midbrain (within the mesencephalic reticular formation and just dorsal to the CN&#160;III nuclei) may cause CI with normal CN&#160;III function. Treatment options include monocular occlusion, convergence exercises, prism glasses, and, in rare cases, strabismus surgery.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Accommodative esotropia</span> Excessive convergence tone is typically observed in younger patients who have an inborn convergence abnormality that manifests as an early-&#173;onset esotropia—that is, a high AC/A ratio, which produces an excessive amount of convergence for a given amount of accommodation (see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Spasm of the near reflex (convergence spasm)</span> Spasm of the near reflex consists of intermittent episodes of excess convergence, accommodation, and pupillary constriction. Isolated spasm of the near reflex is almost never related to organic disease. However, when convergence spasm is associated with other abnormalities, especially convergence-&#173;retraction nystagmus and reduced conjugate upgaze (as in dorsal midbrain syndrome), organic neurologic impairment is present. Acquired convergence spasm may also be observed in patients with lesions at the junction of the diencephalon and mesencephalon, thalamus, lower brainstem, and cerebellum, in association with other signs and symptoms related to lesion location (eg, thalamic esotropia due to thalamic hemorrhage, Wernicke encephalopathy, Arnold-&#173;Chiari malformation, multiple sclerosis, midbrain stroke, and phenytoin intoxication).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Divergence insufficiency</span> Divergence insufficiency (DI) is an acquired ocular misalignment defined by an esodeviation that is greater at distance than near fixation, without lateral incomitance and without abduction deficits. This disorder is usually benign and not related to neurologic dysfunction. In older patients, DI often results from involution of the connective tissue band between the superior rectus and lateral rectus muscles, causing inferior displacement of the lateral rectus muscles (ie, sagging eye syndrome). The malpositioned lateral rectus muscles have reduced abduction force, resulting in DI pattern esotropia. Rarely, DI may be caused by neurological disorders such as increased intracranial pressure, midbrain tumors, Miller Fisher syndrome, head trauma, intracranial hypotension, Arnold-&#173;Chiari malformation, and cerebellar degeneration (often with other signs of these disorders). In addition, DI can be confused with bilateral CN&#160;VI palsies, incipient unilateral CN&#160;VI palsy, or resolving CN&#160;VI palsy. Unlike DI, CN&#160;VI palsy is associated with slow abduction saccades and abduction deficits. When present as an isolated neurologic finding, DI does not require further workup, although patients should be observed for development of other neurologic signs. Treatment options include monocular occlusion, prism glasses, and strabismus surgery.</p>

			<p class="h2">Gaze Preference, Gaze Palsy, and Tonic Deviations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Gaze preference is an acute inability to produce gaze contralateral to the side of a cerebral (supranuclear) lesion; it is accompanied by a tendency for tonic deviation of the eyes toward the side of the lesion. In such cases, the doll’s head maneuver generates a full range of horizontal eye movements because the vestibular-&#173;ocular pathways are intact. Stroke is the most common etiology for this type of cerebral injury. The eye movement dysfunction is generally temporary, lasting only days or weeks. Presumably, alternative cerebral-&#173;bulbar pathways (perhaps from the parietal lobe) become increasingly capable of generating the saccades and maintaining central gaze.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Gaze palsy is a symmetric limitation of the movements of both eyes in the same direction (ie, a conjugate ophthalmoplegia). Brainstem lesions that produce a horizontal gaze palsy disrupt eye movements toward the side of the lesion (opposite to the pattern observed with lesions of the FEF). With CN&#160;VI nuclear lesions, a gaze palsy occurs because the CN&#160;VI nucleus also contains internuclear neurons destined for the contralateral CN&#160;III subnucleus via the MLF. CN&#160;VI nuclear lesions damage the final common site for supranuclear innervation of horizontal eye movements; thus, the doll’s head maneuver is ineffective in driving the paretic eyes toward the side of the lesion. Bilateral pontine injury can abolish all horizontal eye movements (Fig 8-4). This devastating injury still allows vertical eye movements, which often occur spontaneously (ie, ocular bobbing). Congenital horizontal gaze palsy can occur as part of Möbius syndrome, in which aplasia of the CN&#160;VI nuclei is accompanied by bilateral facial paresis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vertical gaze palsies can manifest as selective limitation of upgaze or downgaze. In either case, the lesion is usually in the midbrain. Limitation of conjugate upgaze occurs with damage to the pretectum, an isthmus between the superior colliculi and the thalamus. Supranuclear fibers that control vertical gaze (upgaze greater than downgaze) decussate through the pretectum (posterior commissure) as they pass to the riMLF, the midbrain structure that functions as the saccadic generator for vertical eye movements (and thus is the homologue of the PPRF for horizontal saccades). Clinical manifestations of <span class="italic">dorsal midbrain syndrome</span> (also known as <span class="italic">pretectal</span> or <span class="italic">Parinaud syndrome</span>) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-5</span>) include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">conjugate limitation of vertical gaze (usually upgaze)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">co-contraction of extraocular muscles with attempted upgaze (convergence-&#173;retraction nystagmus)</li>

				<li class="bullet-list-last">increased SWJs</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with dorsal midbrain syndrome often present with only a subset of these signs, although the limitation of conjugate upgaze is the most common feature. Common etiologies of this syndrome include hydrocephalus, ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction, mass lesions (especially pineal-&#173;based tumors), multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Whipple disease. Workup must include neuroimaging. Treatment consists of addressing the underlying etiology. Residual diplopia can be treated with prisms, and upgaze deficits can be improved with strabismus surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The pretectum is the terminal structure supplied by the artery of Percheron (small penetrating arteries that arise from the area around the top of the basilar artery; see Chapter&#160;1). Stenosis at the origin of these vessels, disease of the more proximal basilar artery, or entrapment of emboli that lodge at the top of the basilar artery can infarct the riMLF, resulting in vertical saccadic gaze deficits with relative sparing of vertical pursuit and vestibular-&#173;ocular movements.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Deviation of the eyes may occur with seizures involving any cerebral lobe. Most notably, a lesion of the FEF that causes excess neural activity, such as a focal seizure, will drive the eyes contralaterally during the period of the seizure. The head also may turn contralateral to the seizure focus during the ictus. In the postictal state, when there may be lingering hypoactivity of the FEF neurons, the eyes may deviate ipsilateral to the side of the lesion because of a relative increase in input from the unaffected FEF on the opposite side of the brain.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Transient and conjugate downward or upward ocular deviation may occur in healthy newborns. In these cases, the vertical doll’s head maneuver can move the eyes out of their tonically held position. Tonic downgaze in premature newborns, however, may be associated with serious neurologic disease, especially when intraventricular hemorrhage expands the third ventricle and presses on the pretectum. Tonic downward deviation of the eyes combined with retraction of the eyelids, referred to as the <span class="italic">setting sun sign,</span> is primarily observed in children as part of dorsal midbrain syndrome. Conjugate paresis of upgaze is an associated finding, and in these cases, the doll’s head maneuver cannot induce upward movements of the eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Oculogyric crisis</span> is a tonic upward ocular deviation, sometimes directed toward the right or left. Patients find it difficult to direct their eyes downward. This disorder often arises from an idiosyncratic reaction to neuroleptic antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol and fluphenazine, as well as antiemetic drugs such as metoclopramide, which are strong dopaminergic blockers. These drugs alter supranuclear input onto the ocular motor nuclei. The crisis may persist for hours. Patients with Wilson disease may have an oculogyric crisis. Administration of anticholinergic drugs (eg, prochlorperazine) promptly stops the crisis.</p>
