			<p class="chapter-title">The Patient With Nonorganic Ophthalmic Disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nonorganic ophthalmic disorders can occur in children or adults and are diagnosed after the clinician determines that there is no physiologic or organic basis for the patient’s symptoms. A diagnosis of nonorganic vision loss is not a diagnosis of exclusion but rather an active diagnosis that requires confirmatory findings.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Malingering</span> refers to the willful feigning or exaggeration of symptoms. Litigation involving monetary compensation or disability status is frequently an issue with these patients. Secondary psychological gain is often the underlying basis of <span class="italic">Münchausen syndrome,</span> in which patients intentionally induce physical damage. <span class="italic">Hysteria</span> is a subconscious expression of nonorganic signs or symptoms; patients with hysteria are often unconcerned about their incapacitating symptoms (exhibiting “la belle indifference”). The terms <span class="italic">functional, nonphysiologic,</span> and <span class="italic">nonorganic</span> are preferable when describing this disease spectrum. A substantial proportion of patients with actual organic disease may also exhibit superimposed nonorganic behavior. Patients with so-called nonorganic overlay may be very challenging; the clinician must ensure that the organic portion of disease is properly identified and treated (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;13-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="h1">Clinical Profile</p>
				<div id="Chapt13_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The first step in identifying a patient with a nonorganic disorder is to have a high index of suspicion when the patient’s pattern of vision loss does not fit the common sequence of known diseases. For example, trivial external trauma to the eye should not cause long-term disabling vision loss. Potential secondary gain factors may become evident as the examiner records the patient’s history. Some patients may be more focused on impending litigation or disability determination than on the diagnosis or treatment of their complaint.</p>
			<p class="body-text">“Everything counts” should be the clinician’s guiding principle. Each piece of information about the patient, from the time the appointment is made through completion of the office visit, may help direct the examination. For example, patients wearing sunglasses to their appointments were found to be more likely to have nonorganic vision loss. The patient’s general behavior and ocular capabilities should be observed throughout the examination. Can the patient successfully walk into the room and take a seat in a chair or shake the physician’s silently outstretched hand? Does the patient appear to have difficulty with nonvisual tasks such as signing in at the front desk? Displaying empathy, employing active listening, and carefully recording the patient’s story help the clinician to ensure that the doctor-&#173;patient relationship remains productive and nonconfrontational.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Suspicion should increase if the ophthalmic examination demonstrates a mismatch between objective and subjective findings. Examiners must be patient, persistent, and confident with the tests being used. The examiner can use <span class="italic">misdirection</span> to encourage a patient’s belief that a particular eye or function being tested is part of a normal eye examination, when in reality the examiner may be working to confirm a nonorganic disorder by demonstrating a nonphysiologic response, improved visual acuity, visual fields, or ocular motility.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A diagnosis of a nonorganic component can be confirmed when the patient does something that should not be possible based on the stated symptoms. Some tests may yield results that suggest the patient is not cooperating but do not prove a nonorganic disorder. The examination must be tailored to the individual and the specific concerns.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the scope and economic impact of nonorganic ophthalmic disorders are difficult to measure, somatic manifestations of psychogenic origin may account for at least 10% of patient visits to family physicians. The cost to society from nonorganic ophthalmic disturbances is enormous.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Examination Techniques</p>
				<div id="Chapt13_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician’s main goals for the examination of patients with suspected nonorganic ophthalmic disorders are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2">exclude an organic cause by performing a thorough and complete history and examination</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">distinguish organic findings from nonorganic findings</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">meticulously test for positive clinical features that support the diagnosis</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The examination is based on symptoms that may manifest in the following categories:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">&#9;1.&#9;afferent visual pathway (visual acuity and visual field)</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;2.&#9;ocular motility and alignment</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;3.&#9;pupils and accommodation</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-4">&#9;4.&#9;eyelid position and function</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Afferent Visual Pathway</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Selection of the appropriate tests of the afferent visual pathway will depend on whether the dysfunction appears to be visual acuity loss (complete or partial, bilateral or monocular) or a visual field defect.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Bilateral no light perception</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several tests, visual and nonvisual, are used when a patient reports complete bilateral blindness (ie, no light perception). A patient’s inability to perform nonvisual tasks may provide evidence of a nonorganic component to that patient’s report of total blindness. Proprioceptive testing, such as failure to sign a paper or adequately perform a finger-&#173;to-nose test, in the absence of systemic neurologic diseases, should alert the clinician to problems (conscious or unconscious) with patient cooperation.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h4-head">Finger-touching test</span> In this test, the patient is asked to touch the fingertips of each hand together. A truly blind person can easily touch the fingertips together, because it requires proprioception, not vision (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-1</span>). Therefore, a patient who claims to have no vision but cannot touch the fingertips of each hand together is responding in a nonphysiologic fashion.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h4-head">Pupillary reaction</span> The presence of normal pupillary reactions suggests that the anterior visual pathways are intact. However, it does not prove the loss is nonorganic; there could be involvement of the bilateral anterior visual pathways or the pathways posterior to the branching of axons to the pretectal nuclei (eg, lateral geniculate nucleus, optic radiations, or occipital cortex). An aversive light reaction by a patient who claims blindness establishes at least some level of afferent input.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h4-head">Optokinetic nystagmus drum</span> Perhaps the easiest test to perform is to slowly rotate an optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) drum in front of the patient. If the patient claims to see nothing but the patient’s eyes move with the drum, a nonorganic component has been established. It is possible for malingerers to purposely minimize or prevent the response by looking around or focusing past the drum.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Mirror test</span> In this test, a large mirror is slowly rotated side to side in front of the patient. As in the drum test, if the patient claims to see nothing but the examiner notes eye movement with the mirror, then a subjective–objective mismatch has been documented.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Electrophysiologic testing</span> Flash and pattern-&#173;reversal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) can play a role in assessing a possible nonorganic disorder. Although both false-&#173;positive and false-&#173;negative results are possible, the results can be used to confirm organic disease, for example a VEP with increased latency and decreased amplitude. Normal VEP results for a patient who reports severe monocular or binocular vision loss and who has normal clinical examination findings support a diagnosis of nonorganic disturbance of vision. An abnormal pattern-&#173;reversal visual evoked response in a patient who has normal findings on neuro-&#173;ophthalmic examination should not, by itself, lead to a diagnosis of an organic defect. A patient can use a variety of techniques (eg, inattention, lack of concentration, meditation, defocusing) to willfully suppress a visual evoked response (see the section “Visual evoked potential” in Chapter&#160;3).</p>
			<p class="h3">Monocular no light perception</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All of the tests described for bilateral no light perception may be performed unilaterally. The clinician may also employ tests that involve ocular viewing confusion or tests that require binocularity.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Relative afferent pupillary defect</span> In patients who claim complete vision loss in 1&#160;eye only, the absence of a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) substantially increases, but does not confirm, the likelihood of nonorganic visual loss when eye examination findings are normal (see Chapter&#160;3).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Base-out prism test</span> For this test, the clinician places a 4–6&#160;prism diopters (<span class="greek--tx-">D</span>) prism base-out in front of 1&#160;eye while the patient keeps both eyes open; normally, this procedure elicits an inward shift of that eye (either as a conjugate saccade followed by a convergent movement of the opposite eye or by a convergent movement alone). Movement that occurs when the prism is placed over the eye with worse vision (“bad eye”) indicates vision in that eye.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Vertical prism dissociation test</span> A 4&#160;<span class="greek--tx-">D</span> prism is placed base-down in front of the eye with better vision (“good eye”) of a patient who reports monocular vision loss. If the subject has symmetric vision in both eyes, 2&#160;images should be seen, 1 above the other. If the subject is able to see the letters only with the “good” eye, then only 1&#160;image should be seen (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-2</span>).</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Confusion tests</span> For confusion tests to be successful, the patient must be unaware of which eye is actually being tested. Testing must appear to be simply a normal part of the examination. Any suspicion on the part of the patient will be detrimental to the test interpretation.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h5-head">fogging test</span> In this test, the clinician employs a trial frame with plus and minus cylinder lenses (6&#160;diopters [D]), which have their axes aligned; these are placed in front of the patient’s “good” eye. The patient is asked to read the Snellen chart while one of the cylinder lenses is rotated. The rotation will severely blur vision as the two axes are rotated out of alignment. If the patient continues to read, he or she is doing so with the “bad” eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h5-head">duochrome test</span> The examiner places duochrome (Worth 4-dot) glasses over the patient’s eyes, with the red lens over the “bad” eye. The red-green filter is then placed over the Snellen chart, presenting the letters simultaneously either on a green or a red background. The green lens will prevent the good eye from seeing the red background letters. If the red letters are read, the patient is reading with the “nonseeing” eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h5-head">polarized lens test</span> The patient wears the polarized lenses that are used in the stereoacuity test while reading a chart specially projected with corresponding polarized filters. The clinician can ask the patient to read specific letters or lines to determine whether the patient is reading with the “bad” eye.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Stereopsis testing</span> Stereopsis requires binocular vision. Patients may be tested for stereopsis with the standard stereoacuity test (using their appropriate near correction). Any evidence of stereopsis demonstrates that vision is present in the “bad” eye. It should be noted that patients with vision in only 1&#160;eye may be able to detect asymmetries in the first several circles on the basis of monocular clues. However, if the circle is “standing out from the page,” the patient has binocularity.</p>
			<p class="h3">Monocular reduced vision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients who report symptoms of reduced vision are more challenging. The clinician must convincingly demonstrate that the patient has better visual acuity than initially claimed. Many of the tests described for patients with binocular or monocular no light perception can also be used for patients with monocular (and binocular) reduced vision.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Confusion tests</span> The confusion tests described in the section “Monocular no light perception” are useful if the patient reports substantial reduction in visual acuity in 1&#160;eye. The fogging test, duochrome test, and polarized lens test may help the clinician obtain a quantitative visual acuity measurement if the patient is cooperative enough to continue reading. Unlike the assessment of a patient who claims monocular blindness, in this case, simply demonstrating that the patient can read is not sufficient; the clinician must determine the actual visual acuity.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Stereopsis testing</span> As previously stated, the presence of stereopsis indicates that the patient has at least some vision in both eyes. Although attempts have been made to equate visual acuity and quantitative stereopsis, this relationship suggests, but does not establish, nonorganic vision loss (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;13-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Binocular reduced vision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Binocular reduced vision is the most difficult symptom to address in patients with nonorganic vision loss. Proving a nonorganic disorder requires time and patience from the examiner to induce the patient to admit to seeing better than initially claimed.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Bottom-up acuity</span> This examination begins with a visual acuity determination on the smallest line on the Snellen chart (20/10). If the patient cannot see these letters, the examiner announces the use of a “larger line” and then switches to the 20/15&#160;line and several different 20/20&#160;lines. The examiner continually expresses disbelief that such “large” letters cannot be identified. If the patient still denies being able to read the letters, he or she is asked to determine the number of characters present and whether the characters are round, square, and so on. The examiner might suggest that the characters are letters and that the first one is easier to identify than the others. By the time the “very large letters” (ie, 20/50) are reached, the patient often can read optotypes much smaller than initially identified.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Alternately, small (⅛&#160;D) plus and minus lenses or small cylinders are added and subtracted while the patient is asked how many letters are visible and what shape they are. It is sometimes possible to gradually improve the best-&#173;recorded visual acuity with this method.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">“Visual aids”</span> The examiner can have the patient wear trial frames with 4&#160;lenses equaling the correct prescription but suggest that they are special magnifying lenses that might enable improved vision. The potential acuity meter can also be presented as a means of “bypassing the visual block.” Improvement in either case suggests a nonorganic component.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Use of alternative charts</span> Patients may be persuaded to see substantially better by a switch in optotypes. For example, a patient who refuses to read type smaller than 20/200&#160;using standard optotypes might read much better from a tumbling E&#160;chart or a chart with numbers.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Specialty charts</span> Specialty charts with the top line in 50&#160;optotype instead of 400&#160;optotype are available. Patients who say they can read only the “top line” immediately improve their resolution by 4&#160;lines. Alternatively, the standard chart may be moved farther away.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Visual field defect</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although less common than visual acuity loss, patients do occasionally report difficulty seeing on 1&#160;side. The problem may be binocular but is more commonly monocular with nonspecific constrictions.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Automated perimetry testing</span> In general, this type of testing is not helpful in distinguishing organic from nonorganic visual field loss. The machines are quite easy to fool; if motivated, an observer can reproduce homonymous defects, altitudinal defects, or even arcuate and central scotomata. Nonetheless, central scotomata are extremely rare in nonorganic vision loss and warrant further evaluation. There are no characteristic changes in automated perimetry testing results that would confirm the suspicion of a nonorganic deficit. However, one unusual situation in which automated perimetry testing might be useful would be for a patient with a monocular defect that appears to respect the vertical midline. If repeating the field testing with both eyes open produces a similar, or even incomplete or “missing-&#173;half,” defect, then a nonorganic component is present (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="reference-first ParaOverride-8">Frisen L. Identification of functional visual field loss by automated static perimetry. <span class="italic">Acta Ophthalmol.</span> 2014;92(8):805–809.</p>
			<p class="reference-last--no-space-">Sitko KR, Peragallo JH, Bidot S, Biousse V, Newman NJ, Bruce BB. Pitfalls in the use of stereoacuity in the diagnosis of nonorganic visual loss. <span class="italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2016;123(1):198–202.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Confrontation testing</span> This test is useful in the case of a dense visual field defect. The area where the patient “can’t see” is carefully identified. Later, the patient is tested for “motility.” As part of this examination, stimuli are placed in various areas of the patient’s peripheral field, including those areas where the patient “couldn’t see.” Accurate saccades to these nonauditory targets indicate an intact visual field.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some cases, confrontation testing (“silent visual fields”) might initially appear to confirm a dense visual field defect. The patient is subsequently asked to count fingers in the “nonseeing” field and is instructed to report “none” when no fingers are seen. As the test progresses, the examiner begins showing fingers without saying anything. A response of “none” each time the fingers are put up confirms vision in that area.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Kinetic perimetry testing</span> In manual kinetic perimetry (Goldmann) testing, the visual field is tested continuously in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction starting with the I4e stimulus. A common nonorganic response shows a spiraling isopter getting closer and closer to fixation as testing continues. As larger stimuli (III4e and V4e) are employed, there is often further constriction, resulting in overlapping isopters (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-6</span>). The latter can also be detected with automated kinetic perimetry. It is important to make sure there is no step across the vertical or nasal horizontal midline; a step across the midline may indicate that at least some physiologic component is present in the field abnormality.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Tangent screen testing</span> In tangent screen testing, the patient is tested with a 9-mm white stimulus at 1&#160;m. The areas of patient response are marked and the patient is moved back to 2&#160;m. The test is then repeated using an 18-mm white stimulus. The field should expand to twice the original size. Failure to expand (tubular or gun-&#173;barrel field) is nonphysiologic and indicates a nonorganic component to the field constriction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-7</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Ocular Motility and Alignment</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Voluntary flutter (“nystagmus”)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Voluntary flutter, which is sometimes misdiagnosed as nystagmus, is characterized by irregular, brief bursts of rapid-&#173;frequency and low-&#173;amplitude eye movements with no slow phase (see Chapter&#160;9).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Gaze palsy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients may report an inability to move the eyes horizontally or vertically. Such claimed gaze palsies may be overcome by a variety of maneuvers or tests, such as including those in oculocephalic reflex (doll’s head phenomenon), OKN drum, mirror tracking, and inner ear caloric stimulation.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Spasm of the near reflex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Spasm of the near reflex is characterized by episodes of intermittent convergence, increased accommodation, and miosis. Patients generally report diplopia and, at times, micropsia. The degree of convergence is variable, ranging from a large esotropia to only 1&#160;eye turning in. This syndrome may be mistaken for unilateral or bilateral cranial nerve (CN)&#160;VI palsies, divergence insufficiency, horizontal gaze paresis, or ocular myasthenia gravis. Variability of the eye movements, miosis with convergent eye movements, and lack of other neuro-&#173;ophthalmic abnormalities are clues that can help the examiner reach the correct diagnosis. Further, when ductions are examined with 1&#160;eye occluded or with oculocephalic testing, both eyes demonstrate full abduction, and the miosis observed with the eyes in an esotropic position immediately resolves. Although spasm of the near reflex is almost always observed in patients with nonorganic disturbances, it has also been associated with Arnold-&#173;Chiari type&#160;I malformation, posterior fossa tumors, pituitary tumors, and head trauma.</p>
			<p class="h2">Pupils and Accommodation</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Fixed, dilated pupil</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Few patients provoke more concern regarding a potentially life-&#173;threatening neurologic condition than those with headaches and a fixed, dilated pupil. The differential diagnosis can be narrowed to pharmacologic blockade, CN&#160;III palsy, and Adie tonic pupil. <span class="italic">Pharmacologic blockade</span> may occur because of inadvertent or purposeful application of mydriatic or cycloplegic eyedrops; it may also occur after touching the eyes with fingers contaminated through use of a scopolamine patch or touching certain plants that contain parasympatholytic chemicals.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The pilocarpine test distinguishes parasympathetic denervation from pharmacologic blockade. In pharmacologic blockade, 1% pilocarpine cannot overcome the receptor blockade, and the pupil remains large. Dilute pilocarpine will constrict a dilated pupil in a majority of patients with either a CN&#160;III palsy or Adie tonic pupil. See Chapter&#160;10 for further discussion of pupillary abnormalities.</p>
			<p class="h3">Changes in pupil size</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Widely dilated pupils may be observed in young patients, most likely caused by increased levels of circulating catecholamines. A few patients are able to voluntarily dilate both pupils. Intermittent miosis occurs in spasm of the near reflex (discussed earlier), accompanied by esotropia and accommodation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Changes in accommodation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Weakness or paralysis of accommodation sometimes occurs, primarily in children and young adults. Such patients may complain of an inability to read clearly even in the presence of an appropriate plus lens. If a patient with normal distance vision fails to read despite appropriate near-&#173;vision correction, a nonorganic condition is possible.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Spasm of accommodation can be observed with spasm of the near reflex. Patients may report blurred distance vision and often can produce 8–10&#160;D of myopia. Refraction with and without cycloplegia during the period of spasm establishes the presence of the induced myopia.</p>
			<p class="h2">Eyelid Position and Function</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Ptosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyelid “droop” from nonphysiologic causes can usually be distinguished by the position of the brow. In a patient with true ptosis, the brow is usually elevated as the patient tries to widen the palpebral fissure. With orbicularis overactivity, the brow is lowered.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients who feign ptosis generally cannot simultaneously elevate the eye and maintain a drooping eyelid. Thus, with upward gaze, the ptosis will “resolve.” Often the patient will realize this and not cooperate. In such cases, the examiner can use his or her thumb to manually elevate the ptotic eyelid and the patient will then look upward. The examiner’s thumb is then slowly moved away. If the ptosis returns, the condition may well have an organic basis, but if it “resolves,” then it is nonorganic.</p>
			<p class="h3">Blepharospasm</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nonorganic blepharospasm may be unilateral or bilateral and typically occurs in children or young adults. It may be triggered by an emotionally traumatic event and may cause nonorganic ptosis. Pressure over the supraorbital notch is often useful in raising the eyelids.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Management of the Patient With Nonorganic Ophthalmic Disorders</p>
				<div id="Chapt13_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After taking a detailed history and performing a thorough examination, the clinician needs to clearly document that no organic damage to the visual system was detected. In addition, the clinician should highlight any specific findings from the clinical examination and tests that confirm the inconsistencies and suggest a nonorganic etiology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with nonorganic visual disorders are best managed with understanding and encouragement. Confrontation is seldom beneficial, and it is prudent to allow patients a graceful way out by reassuring them that their disorder, while unlikely to reflect a serious condition, is a problem that will resolve over time. Often, the symptoms will clear after 1 or 2&#160;follow-&#173;up visits, and patients should be reassured of an “excellent prognosis.” This approach is usually more effective with children than adults. Children may be further encouraged through the prescription of “eye rest”—for example, by limiting the use of electronic technology and entertainment devices.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with combined organic and nonorganic (nonorganic overlay) complaints, it is best to manage the organic problem and attempt to downplay the nonorganic portion. In some cases, consultation with a psychiatrist or psychologist may be warranted for an underlying psychological illness. Finally, it is always important to monitor a patient with what initially appears to be a nonorganic visual disturbance. Occasionally, an organic disorder becomes apparent later and can be managed appropriately.</p>
