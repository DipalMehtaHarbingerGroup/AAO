			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Normal Development of the Lens</p>
		    <div id="Chapt4_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The formation of the human crystalline lens begins very early in embryogenesis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-1</span>). At approximately 25&#160;days of gestation, 2&#160;lateral evaginations, called the <span class="italic">optic vesicles,</span> form from the forebrain, or diencephalon. As the optic vesicles enlarge and extend laterally, they become closely apposed and adherent to the <span class="italic">surface ectoderm,</span> a single layer of cuboidal cells, in 2&#160;patches on either side of the head. (See BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> for additional discussion and illustrations of ocular development.)</p>
			<p class="h2">Lens Placode</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ectoderm cells that overlie the optic vesicles become columnar at approximately 27&#160;days of gestation. This area of thickened cells is called the <span class="italic">lens placode.</span> Growth factors of the <span class="italic">bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)</span> family are required for formation of the lens placode and, subsequently, the lens.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lens Pit</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens pit appears at 29&#160;days of gestation as an indentation (infolding) of the lens placode. The lens pit deepens and invaginates to form the lens vesicle.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lens Vesicle</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As the lens pit continues to invaginate, the stalk of cells connecting it to the surface ectoderm degenerates by programmed cell death (apoptosis), thereby separating the lens cells from the surface ectoderm. The resultant sphere, a single layer of cuboidal cells encased in a basement membrane (the <span class="italic">lens capsule</span>), is called the <span class="italic">lens vesicle.</span> At the time of its formation at 30&#160;days of gestation, the lens vesicle is approximately 0.2&#160;mm in diameter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because the lens vesicle was formed through a process of invagination of the surface ectoderm, the apices of the cuboidal cells are oriented toward the lumen of the lens vesicle, with the base of each cell attached to the capsule around the periphery of the vesicle. At the same time that the lens vesicle is forming, the optic vesicle is invaginating to form the 2-layered <span class="italic">optic cup.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Primary Lens Fibers and the Embryonic Nucleus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cells in the posterior layer of the lens vesicle stop dividing and begin to elongate. As they elongate, they begin to fill the lumen of the lens vesicle. At approximately 40&#160;days of gestation, the lumen of the lens vesicle is obliterated. The elongated cells are called the <span class="italic">primary lens fibers.</span> As the fiber cells mature, their nuclei and other membrane-&#173;bound organelles undergo degradation, a process that reduces light scattering. The primary lens fibers make up the embryonic nucleus that will ultimately occupy the central area of the adult lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cells of the anterior lens vesicle remain as a monolayer of cuboidal cells, the <span class="italic">lens epithelium.</span> Subsequent growth of the lens is due to proliferation within the epithelium. The <span class="italic">lens capsule</span> develops as a basement membrane elaborated by the lens epithelium anteriorly and by lens fibers posteriorly.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Secondary Lens Fibers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After they proliferate, the epithelial cells near the lens equator elongate to form secondary lens fibers. The anterior aspect of each developing lens fiber extends anteriorly beneath the lens epithelium, toward the anterior pole of the lens. The posterior aspect of each developing lens fiber extends posteriorly along the capsule, toward the posterior pole of the lens. In this manner, new lens fibers are continually formed, layer upon layer. As each secondary fiber cell detaches from the capsule, it loses its nucleus and membrane-&#173;bound organelles. The secondary lens fibers formed between 2 and 8&#160;months of gestation make up the <span class="italic">fetal nucleus.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Lens Sutures and the Fetal Nucleus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As lens fibers grow anteriorly and posteriorly, a pattern emerges where the ends of the fibers meet and interdigitate with the ends of fibers arising on the opposite side of the lens, near the anterior and posterior poles. These patterns of cell association are known as <span class="italic">sutures.</span> Y-shaped sutures are recognizable at approximately 8&#160;weeks of gestation, with an erect Y-suture appearing anteriorly and an inverted Y-suture posteriorly (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-2</span>). As the lens fibers continue to form and the lens continues to grow, the pattern of lens sutures becomes increasingly complex, resulting in 12&#160;or more suture branches in the adult eye. The mechanisms responsible for the precise formation and changing organization of the suture pattern remain obscure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The human lens weighs approximately 90&#160;mg at birth, and it increases in mass by approximately 2&#160;mg per year as new fibers form throughout life. The central, or oldest, lens fibers gradually become less malleable, and the lens nucleus becomes more rigid. This process progressively reduces the amplitude of accommodation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Tunica Vasculosa Lentis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Around 1&#160;month of gestation, the hyaloid artery, which enters the eye at the optic nerve head (also called the optic disc), branches to form a network of capillaries, the tunica vasculosa lentis, on the posterior surface of the lens capsule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-3</span>). These capillaries grow toward the equator of the lens, where they anastomose with a second network of capillaries, called the <span class="italic">anterior pupillary membrane.</span> This membrane derives from the ciliary veins and covers the anterior surface of the lens. At approximately 9&#160;weeks of gestation, the capillary network surrounding the lens is fully developed; it disappears by an orderly process of programmed cell death shortly before birth. Sometimes a remnant of the tunica vasculosa lentis persists as a small opacity or strand, called a <span class="italic">Mittendorf dot</span> (discussed later in this chapter), on the posterior aspect of the lens. In other eyes, remnants of the pupillary membrane are often visible as pupillary strands.</p>
			<p class="h2">The Zonule of Zinn</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Experimental evidence suggests that the zonular fibers are secreted by the ciliary epithelium, although how these fibers insert into the lens capsule is not known. The zonular fibers begin to develop at the end of the third month of gestation.</p>

			<p class="h1">Congenital Anomalies and Abnormalities</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most significant congenital anomalies of the eye and orbit are apparent on ultrasonography before birth. As a rule, the more profound the abnormality, the earlier in development it occurred. Disorders of the lens include abnormalities in lens shape, size, location, and development, as well as cataract.</p>
			<p class="h2">Congenital Aphakia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens is absent in congenital aphakia, a very rare anomaly. Two forms of congenital aphakia have been described. In <span class="italic">primary aphakia,</span> the lens placode fails to form from the surface ectoderm in the developing embryo. In <span class="italic">secondary aphakia,</span> the more common type, the developing lens is spontaneously absorbed. Both forms of aphakia are usually associated with other malformations of the eye.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lenticonus and Lentiglobus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lenticonus is a localized, cone-shaped deformation of the anterior or posterior lens surface (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-4</span>). Posterior lenticonus is more common than anterior lenticonus and is usually unilateral and axial in location. Anterior lenticonus is often bilateral and may be associated with Alport syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In lentiglobus, the localized deformation of the lens surface is spherical. Posterior lentiglobus is more common than anterior lentiglobus and is often associated with posterior polar opacities that vary in density.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retinoscopy through the center of the lens reveals a distorted and myopic reflex in both lenticonus and lentiglobus. These deformations can also be seen in the red reflex, where, by retroillumination, they appear as an “oil droplet.” (This condition should not be confused with the “oil droplet” cataract of galactosemia, which is discussed in Chapter&#160;5.) The posterior bulging may progress with initial worsening of the myopia, followed by opacification of the defect. Surrounding cortical lamellae may also opacify.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lens Coloboma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A lens coloboma is an anomaly of lens shape (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-5</span>). <span class="italic">Primary coloboma</span> is a wedge-shaped defect or indentation of the lens periphery that occurs as an isolated anomaly. <span class="italic">Secondary coloboma</span> is a flattening or indentation of the lens periphery caused by the lack of ciliary body or zonular development. Lens colobomas are typically located inferonasally and may be associated with colobomas of the iris, optic nerve, or retina. Cortical lens opacification or thickening of the lens capsule may appear adjacent to the coloboma. The zonular attachments in the region of the coloboma are usually weakened or absent.</p>
			<p class="h2">Mittendorf Dot</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mittendorf dot, mentioned earlier in this chapter, is a common anomaly observed in many healthy eyes. A small, dense white spot generally located inferonasal to the posterior pole of the lens, a Mittendorf dot is a remnant of the posterior pupillary membrane of the tunica vasculosa lentis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-6</span>). It marks the place where the hyaloid artery came into contact with the posterior surface of the lens in utero. Sometimes a Mittendorf dot is associated with a fibrous tail or remnant of the hyaloid artery projecting into the vitreous body.</p>
			<p class="h2">Epicapsular Star</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Another very common remnant of the tunica vasculosa lentis is an epicapsular star (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-7</span>). As its name suggests, this anomaly is a star-shaped distribution of tiny brown or golden flecks on the central anterior lens capsule. It may be unilateral or bilateral.</p>
			<p class="h2">Peters Anomaly</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Peters anomaly is part of a spectrum of disorders known as <span class="italic">anterior segment dysgenesis syndrome,</span> also referred to as <span class="italic">neurocristopathy</span> or <span class="italic">mesodermal dysgenesis.</span> (See also BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span>) Peters anomaly is characterized by a central or paracentral corneal opacity (leukoma) associated with thinning or absence of adjacent endothelium and Descemet membrane. In Peters anomaly type&#160;1, iris strands adherent to the cornea are often present. In Peters anomaly type&#160;2, the lens is adherent to the posterior cornea. In normal ocular development, the lens vesicle separates from the surface ectoderm (the future corneal epithelium) at approximately 33&#160;days of gestation. Peters anomaly is typically linked with the absence of this separation. It is often associated with mutations in or deletion of 1&#160;allele of the genes normally involved in anterior segment development, including the transcription factors <span class="italic">PAX6, PITX2,</span> and <span class="italic">FOXC1.</span> Patients with Peters anomaly type&#160;2 may also display the following lens anomalies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5">anterior cortical or polar cataract</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">a misshapen lens displaced anteriorly into the pupillary space and the anterior chamber</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-6">microspherophakia</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Microspherophakia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Microspherophakia is a developmental abnormality in which the lens is small in diameter and spherical. The entire lens equator can be visualized at the slit lamp when the pupil is widely dilated (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-8</span>). The spherical shape of the lens results in increased refractive power, which causes the eye to be highly myopic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Faulty development of the secondary lens fibers during embryogenesis is believed to be the cause of microspherophakia. Microspherophakia is most often seen as a part of Weill-&#173;Marchesani syndrome, but it may also occur as an isolated hereditary abnormality or, occasionally, in association with Peters anomaly, Marfan syndrome, Alport syndrome, Lowe syndrome, or congenital rubella. Individuals with Weill-&#173;Marchesani syndrome commonly have small stature, short and stubby fingers, and broad hands with reduced joint mobility. Weill-&#173;Marchesani syndrome is usually inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The spherical lens can block the pupil, causing secondary angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. Use of miotics aggravates this condition by increasing pupillary block and allowing additional forward lens displacement. Cycloplegics are the medical treatment of choice to break an attack of angle-&#173;closure glaucoma in patients with microspherophakia, because they decrease pupillary block by tightening the zonular fibers, decreasing the anteroposterior lens diameter, and pulling the lens posteriorly. A laser iridotomy may also be useful in relieving angle closure in patients with microspherophakia. (See also BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma.</span>)</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Aniridia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Aniridia is an uncommon panocular syndrome in which the most dramatic manifestation is partial or nearly complete absence of the iris (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-9</span>). Aniridia has been linked to the loss of 1&#160;allele of the <span class="italic">PAX6</span> gene, a transcription factor that is important for the development and function of the cornea, lens, and retina. Associated findings include corneal pannus and epitheliopathy, glaucoma, foveal and optic nerve hypoplasia, and nystagmus. Aniridia is almost always bilateral. Two-thirds of cases are familial; one-third of cases are sporadic. Sporadic cases of aniridia are associated with a high incidence of Wilms tumor and the WAGR complex (<span class="italic">W</span>ilms tumor, <span class="italic">a</span>niridia, <span class="italic">g</span>enitourinary malformations, and mental <span class="italic">r</span>etardation).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anterior or posterior polar lens opacities may be present at birth in patients with aniridia. Cortical, subcapsular, or lamellar opacities develop in 50%–85% of patients within the first 2&#160;decades of life. The lens opacities may progress, further impairing vision. Poor zonular integrity and ectopia lentis have also been reported in patients with aniridia.</p>
			<p class="h2">Congenital Cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataracts that are present at birth or that develop within the first year of life are called <span class="italic">congenital</span> or <span class="italic">infantile</span> cataracts. Because some lens opacities escape detection at birth and are noted only on later examination, these terms are used interchangeably by many physicians. In this book, the term <span class="italic">congenital cataract</span> is used for both categories of lens opacities. These cataracts are fairly common, occurring in 1 of every 2000&#160;live births, and cover a broad spectrum of severity. While some lens opacities do not progress and are visually insignificant, others can cause profound visual impairment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Congenital cataracts may be unilateral or bilateral. They can be classified by morphology, presumed or defined genetic etiology, presence of specific metabolic disorders, or associated ocular anomalies or systemic findings (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;4-1</span>). In general, approximately one-third of congenital cataracts are a component of a more extensive syndrome or disease (eg, cataract resulting from congenital rubella syndrome), one-third occur as an isolated inherited trait, and one-third result from undetermined causes. Metabolic diseases tend to be more commonly associated with bilateral cataracts. (For a discussion of the evaluation of pediatric patients with congenital cataracts, see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span>) Congenital cataracts occur in a variety of morphologic configurations, including lamellar, polar, sutural, coronary, cerulean, nuclear, capsular, complete, and membranous.</p>
			<p class="h3">Lamellar</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Of the congenital cataracts, lamellar, or <span class="italic">zonular,</span> cataracts are the most common type (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-10</span>). They are characteristically bilateral and symmetric, and their effect on vision varies with the size and density of the opacity. Lamellar cataracts may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. In some cases, they may occur as a result of a transient toxic influence during embryonic lens development. The earlier this toxic influence occurs, the smaller and deeper is the resulting lamellar cataract.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lamellar cataracts are opacifications of specific layers or zones of the lens. Clinically, the cataract is visible as an opacified layer that surrounds a clearer center and is itself surrounded by a layer of clear cortex. Viewed from the front, the lamellar cataract has a disc-shaped configuration. Often, additional arcuate opacities within the cortex straddle the equator of the lamellar cataract; these horseshoe-&#173;shaped opacities are called <span class="italic">riders.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Polar</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Polar cataracts are lens opacities that involve the subcapsular cortex and capsule of the anterior or posterior pole of the lens. <span class="italic">Anterior polar cataracts</span> are usually small, bilateral, symmetric, nonprogressive opacities that do not impair vision (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-11</span>). Most commonly, they are congenital and sporadic, but they may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Anterior polar cataracts are sometimes seen in association with other ocular abnormalities, including microphthalmos, persistent pupillary membrane, and anterior lenticonus. They usually do not require treatment but often cause anisometropia.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Posterior polar cataracts</span> are generally associated with more profound decrease in vision than anterior polar cataracts, because they tend to be larger and are positioned closer to the nodal point of the eye. Capsular fragility has been reported in association with these cataracts, which are usually stable but occasionally progress. They may be familial or sporadic. Familial posterior polar cataracts are usually bilateral and inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Sporadic posterior polar cataracts are often unilateral and may be associated with remnants of the tunica vasculosa lentis or with an abnormality of the posterior lens surface such as lenticonus or lentiglobus.</p>
			<p class="h3">Sutural</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The sutural, or stellate, cataract is an opacification of the Y-sutures of the fetal nucleus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-12</span>). It usually does not impair vision. These opacities often have branches or knobs projecting from them. Sutural cataracts are bilateral and symmetric and are frequently inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.</p>
			<p class="h3">Coronary</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Coronary cataracts are so named because they consist of a group of club-shaped cortical opacities that are arranged around the equator of the lens like a crown, or corona. They cannot be seen unless the pupil is dilated, and they usually do not affect visual acuity. Coronary cataracts are often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.</p>
			<p class="h3">Cerulean</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Also known as <span class="italic">blue-dot cataracts,</span> cerulean cataracts are small bluish opacities located in the lens cortex (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-13</span>). They are nonprogressive and usually do not cause visual symptoms.</p>
			<p class="h3">Nuclear</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital nuclear cataracts are opacities of the embryonic nucleus alone or of both embryonic and fetal nuclei (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-14</span>). They are usually bilateral, with a wide spectrum of severity. Lens opacification may involve the complete nucleus, or it may be limited to discrete layers within the nucleus. Eyes with congenital nuclear cataracts tend to be microphthalmic, and they are at increased risk of developing aphakic glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Capsular</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Capsular cataracts are small opacifications of the lens epithelium and anterior lens capsule that spare the cortex. They are differentiated from anterior polar cataracts by their protrusion into the anterior chamber. Capsular cataracts generally do not adversely affect vision.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Complete</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With complete, or total, cataract, all of the lens fibers are opacified. The red reflex is completely obscured, and the retina cannot be seen with either direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy. Some cataracts may be subtotal at birth and progress rapidly to become complete cataracts. Complete cataracts may be unilateral or bilateral, and they cause profound visual impairment.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Membranous</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Membranous cataracts occur when lens proteins are resorbed from either an intact or a traumatized lens, allowing the anterior and posterior lens capsules to fuse into a dense white membrane (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-15</span>). The resulting opacity and lens distortion generally cause significant visual disability.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Rubella</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Maternal infection with the rubella virus, an RNA togavirus, can cause fetal damage, especially if the infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy. Cataracts resulting from <span class="italic">congenital rubella syndrome</span> are characterized by pearly white nuclear opacifications. Sometimes the entire lens is opacified (complete cataract), and the cortex may liquefy. Histologically, lens-&#173;fiber nuclei are retained deep within the lens substance. Live virus particles may be recovered from the lens as late as 3&#160;years after the patient’s birth. Cataract removal may be complicated by excessive postoperative inflammation caused by release of these particles. (See also BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span>) Other ocular manifestations of congenital rubella syndrome include diffuse pigmentary retinopathy, microphthalmos, glaucoma, and transient or permanent corneal clouding. Although congenital rubella syndrome may cause cataract or glaucoma, both conditions are usually not present simultaneously in the same eye.</p>

            <div id="Chapt4_Top3">
                <p class="h2-h1">Ectopia Lentis</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ectopia lentis is a displacement of the lens that may be congenital, developmental, or acquired. A <span class="italic">subluxated</span> lens is partially displaced from its normal position but remains in the pupillary area. A <span class="italic">luxated,</span> or <span class="italic">dislocated,</span> lens is completely displaced from the pupil, implying separation of all zonular attachments. Findings associated with lens subluxation include decreased vision, marked astigmatism, monocular diplopia, and iridodonesis (tremulous iris). Potential complications of ectopia lentis include cataract and displacement of the lens into the anterior chamber or the vitreous space. Dislocation into the anterior chamber or pupil may cause pupillary block and angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. Dislocation of the lens posteriorly into the vitreous cavity often has no adverse sequelae aside from a profound change in refractive error.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Trauma is the most common cause of acquired lens displacement. Nontraumatic ectopia lentis is commonly associated with Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, aniridia, and congenital glaucoma. Less frequently, it appears with Ehlers-&#173;Danlos syndrome, hyperlysinemia, Weill-&#173;Marchesani syndrome, and sulfite oxidase deficiency. Ectopia lentis may occur as an isolated anomaly (simple ectopia lentis), usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Ectopia lentis can also be associated with pupillary abnormalities in the ocular syndrome ectopia lentis et pupillae (discussed later in this chapter).</p>
                <p class="h3">Marfan syndrome</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Marfan syndrome is a heritable disorder with ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal manifestations. Though usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, the disorder appears with no family history in approximately 15% of cases. Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the fibrillin gene on chromosome&#160;15. Affected individuals are tall, with arachnodactyly (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-16A</span>) and chest wall deformities. Associated cardiovascular abnormalities include dilated aortic root and mitral valve prolapse.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Between 50% and 80% of patients with Marfan syndrome exhibit ectopia lentis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-16B</span>). The lens subluxation tends to be bilateral and symmetric (usually superior and temporal), but variations do occur. The zonular attachments commonly remain intact but become stretched and elongated. Ectopia lentis in Marfan syndrome is probably congenital in most cases. Progression of lens subluxation occurs in some patients over time, but in many patients the lens position remains stable.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Other ocular abnormalities associated with Marfan syndrome include axial myopia and an increased risk of retinal detachment. Patients with Marfan syndrome may develop pupillary block glaucoma if the lens dislocates into the pupil or anterior chamber. Open-&#173;angle glaucoma may also occur. Amblyopia may develop in children with lens subluxation if their refractive error shows significant asymmetry or remains uncorrected in early childhood. Spectacle or contact lens correction of the refractive error provides satisfactory vision in most cases. Pupillary dilation is sometimes helpful. The clinician may refract both the phakic and the aphakic portions of the pupil to determine the optimum visual acuity. A reading add is often necessary because the subluxated lens lacks sufficient accommodation.</p>
                <p class="body-text">In some cases, adequate visual acuity cannot be obtained with spectacle or contact lens correction, and removal of the lens may be indicated. Lens extraction—either extracapsular or intracapsular—in patients with Marfan syndrome is associated with a high rate of complications such as vitreous loss and complex retinal detachment. Advanced surgical techniques, including the use of capsular tension rings and capsular tension segments, are increasingly being used to improve outcomes in these cases (see Chapter&#160;9).</p>
                <p class="h3">Homocystinuria</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Homocystinuria is an inborn error of methionine metabolism that is transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. Serum levels of homocysteine and methionine are elevated. Affected individuals are healthy at birth; however, seizures and osteoporosis develop, and cognitive impairment soon becomes apparent. These patients are usually tall and have light-&#173;colored hair. Patients with homocystinuria are prone to thromboembolic episodes, and surgery and general anesthesia are thought to increase the risk of thromboembolism.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Lens dislocation in homocystinuria tends to be bilateral and symmetric. The dislocation appears in infancy in approximately 30% of affected individuals, and by the age of 15&#160;years, it appears in 80% of those affected. The lenses are usually subluxated inferiorly and nasally, but variations have been reported. Because zonular fibers of the lens are known to have a high concentration of cysteine, deficiency of cysteine is thought to disturb normal zonular development; affected fibers tend to be brittle and easily disrupted. Studies of infants with homocystinuria treated with a low-&#173;methionine, high-&#173;cysteine diet and vitamin supplementation with the coenzyme pyridoxine (vitamin&#160;B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span>) have shown that this therapy may reduce the incidence of sequelae, including ectopia lentis, in some patients. (See also BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span>)</p>
                <p class="h3">Hyperlysinemia</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hyperlysinemia, an inborn error of metabolism of the amino acid lysine, is associated with ectopia lentis. Affected individuals also show cognitive impairment and muscular hypotony.</p>
                <p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Genetic Contributions to Age-Related Cataracts</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Studies of identical and fraternal twins and of familial associations suggest that a large proportion of the risk of age-&#173;related cataracts is inherited. It is estimated that inheritance accounts for more than 50% of the risk of cortical cataracts. Recent studies have identified mutations in the gene associated with congenital and age-&#173;related cortical cataracts, <span class="italic">EPHA2,</span> which has been mapped to 1p36. This is the first gene known to cause hereditary, nonsyndromic age-&#173;related cortical cataracts, although mutations at this locus account for only a small fraction of cortical opacities. Similarly, 35%–50% of the risk of nuclear cataracts can be traced to inheritance. Identification of the genes associated with increased risk of cortical and nuclear cataracts is important, because understanding the biochemical pathways in which they function may suggest ways to slow the progression or prevent the development of age-&#173;related cataracts in a large number of cases.</p>

                <p class="h2">Ectopia Lentis et Pupillae</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the autosomal recessive disorder ectopia lentis et pupillae, the lens and the pupil are displaced in opposite directions. The pupil is irregular, usually slit shaped, and displaced from the normal position. The dislocated lens may bisect the pupil or may be completely absent from the pupillary space. This disorder is usually bilateral but not symmetric. Characteristically, the iris dilates poorly. Associated ocular anomalies include severe axial myopia, retinal detachment, enlarged corneal diameter, cataract, and abnormal iris transillumination.</p>
                <p class="h2">Persistent Fetal Vasculature</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV), also known as <span class="italic">persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV),</span> is a congenital, nonhereditary ocular malformation that frequently involves the lens. In 90% of patients, it is unilateral. A white, fibrous retrolental tissue is present, often in association with posterior cortical opacification. Progressive cataract formation often occurs, sometimes leading to a complete cataract. Other abnormalities associated with PFV include elongated ciliary processes, prominent radial iris vessels, and persistent hyaloid artery. (See BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> for additional discussion.)</p>
