			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A complete discussion of the indications for and technique of cataract surgery in the pediatric age group is presented in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span></p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Psychosocial Considerations</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top1">
			<p class="h2-h1">Claustrophobia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with claustrophobia find it helpful to be told about the operating room and sterile-&#173;draping requirement prior to their surgery. The medical team can make accommodations for the patient who becomes anxious and extremely uncomfortable when confined to a small space or when the patient’s head is covered by a surgical drape. The anesthetist can titrate intravenous sedation and hold the patient’s hand to provide comfort and reassurance during surgery. When feasible, the surgeon can supplement topical or local ocular anesthesia with a “vocal local,” providing soothing support to the patient. Options for reducing the sensation of claustrophobia and avoiding retention of carbon dioxide under the drape include placing a suction catheter under the drape, tenting open the side of the drape, or placing an elevated Mayo stand over the patient’s torso. General anesthesia is chosen when a patient cannot tolerate the aforementioned measures to address claustrophobia.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Neurocognitive and Neurodevelopmental Disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When dementia or other central nervous system impairment interferes with a patient’s ability to communicate symptoms of cataract, the patient’s functional deficit must be evaluated by other methods, such as discussion with a caregiver or family member about the patient’s capacity to carry out activities of daily living. The surgeon may have to rely on objective findings such as degradation of the red reflex, slit-lamp abnormalities, and view of the retina, rather than subjective measurements of visual acuity, to estimate the degree of visual impairment resulting from the cataract. The patient’s ability to tolerate sedation and draping throughout surgery must be appraised, and general anesthesia should be considered for the patient who cannot cooperate. In certain instances when general anesthesia is required, the surgeon may consider immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery. Improving the view of the fundus to monitor and treat retinal disease, as well as the potential for vision rehabilitation and better quality of life, remains the foundation of the decision to proceed with cataract extraction in these situations.</p>
			<p class="h2">Patient Communication During Eye Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Reviewing the mechanics of the surgical experience is beneficial for all patients preoperatively and especially for those who have hearing loss or who do not speak the same language as the surgical team. Patients may wear their hearing aid in the ear opposite to the eye having surgery, both to allow communication and to avoid water damage to the hearing aid ipsilateral to the surgical site. The surgeon, anesthetist, and patient should determine how best to communicate with one another in the operating room. For example, simple hand signals between the patient and the anesthetist are effective. If the patient is very anxious and cannot communicate adequately, general anesthesia should be considered instead of topical or local anesthesia.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Systemic Considerations</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Medical Status</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Medical evaluation by the patient’s primary care physician may be part of the preoperative planning process. Conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus should be stabilized. Because patients are required to fast prior to surgery, insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication often requires adjustment in diabetic patients. Procedures on these patients should be performed as early in the day as possible to minimize large fluctuations in blood glucose levels.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with lung disease, pulmonary function should be optimized prior to and during surgery; patients may be permitted to bring their inhalers into the operating room. Patients with lung disease may be prone to coughing, which can damage ocular structures during surgery and threaten wound security. Coughing should be controlled judiciously with medication and the patient instructed to warn the surgeon of any need to cough. With small-&#173;incision surgery, the risk of such intraoperative complications can be reduced and wound security enhanced. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, congestive heart failure, or obesity benefit from being placed in the reverse Trendelenburg position to reduce venous congestion in the head and neck and lessen the risk of vitreous loss and choroidal hemorrhage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular inflammation such as scleritis and uveitis associated with connective tissue or inflammatory diseases should be controlled preoperatively to minimize the risk of scleral or corneal necrosis. The ophthalmologist can work in conjunction with the other physicians involved in the patient’s care to gauge therapy with systemic corticosteroid and immunosuppressive agents.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For patients with severe arthritis, it can be difficult to lie comfortably during surgery. Usually, the surgical table can be adjusted and pillows added to provide sufficient comfort without interfering with surgical access to the eye. A patient who has ankylosing spondylitis with cervical immobility presents an extreme challenge in surgical positioning (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-1</span>). If no systemic medical contraindications exist and if adequate access cannot be attained otherwise, the surgeon should consider general anesthesia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For a more complete discussion of ocular surgery in patients with systemic disease, see BCSC Section&#160;1, <span class="italic">Update on General Medicine.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Anticoagulation Therapy or Bleeding Disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clear corneal cataract surgery performed with topical anesthesia in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy is not associated with an increased incidence of vision-&#173;threatening hemorrhagic complications. Minor bleeding problems, such as eyelid ecchymosis, hyphema, and subconjunctival hemorrhage, are more common with anticoagulant use, but these are transient and self-&#173;limited. If a retrobulbar block is used, the risk of retrobulbar hemorrhage is 3&#160;times higher when the patient has been taking anticoagulants. The surgeon should weigh the systemic risks of discontinuing therapy with the surgical risks of continuing anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. When warfarin is continued, the international normalized ratio (INR) should be maintained within the therapeutic range.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If anticoagulation therapy is to be discontinued or adjusted for surgery, coordination with the prescribing physician is recommended. Discontinuation of anticoagulation is recommended in patients who have previously experienced a suprachoroidal hemorrhage because these patients are predisposed to recurrent bleeding. Restoring normal coagulation usually requires 3–5&#160;days after stopping warfarin, and restoring platelet function requires 10–21&#160;days after stopping antiplatelet therapy. The clinician should ask the patient about the use of all medications, including nonprescription items that may contain aspirin, vitamin&#160;E, or vitamin&#160;K, which could affect coagulation status. <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;9-1</span> presents a list of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the absence of hypotony or hemorrhagic complications, anticoagulation therapy may be safely resumed following the first postoperative visit. Assessment of the patient’s coagulation profile prior to surgery should be considered for systemic conditions that might alter clotting ability. For further discussion of ocular hemorrhage, see the discussion of hemorrhage in Chapter&#160;8.</p>

			<div id="Chapt9_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Blepharitis and Acne Rosacea</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blepharitis, which is particularly common in patients with acne rosacea, should be controlled before surgery in order to reduce the bacterial colony counts of the ocular surface. Uncontrolled blepharitis causing irritation and an unhealthy tear film may adversely affect the quality of the patient’s vision after cataract surgery. Treatment of anterior blepharitis includes hot compresses and eyelid scrubs. The mainstay of therapy for meibomian gland dysfunction is systemic tetracycline, doxycycline, or minocycline, all of which saponify inspissated meibomian secretions. Although topical ointments poorly penetrate meibomian orifices, newer topical eyedrops such as azithromycin aim to reduce bacterial flora at the surface of the meibomian glands. For a detailed description of the signs and symptoms of blepharitis, see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span></p>

			<p class="h2">Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optimizing dry eye therapy prior to cataract surgery improves visual outcomes. This can be especially important in patients considering premium intraocular lenses (IOLs) such as toric and multifocal lenses. A variety of aqueous layer supportive treatments can be individualized for each surgical candidate; these treatments include topical preserved and nonpreserved liquid tear preparations, gels, and ointments; topical cyclosporine; and punctal plugs. (For a detailed discussion of dry eye therapy, see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span>) During the procedure, the surgeon can prevent desiccation of the corneal epithelium by frequently hydrating the area with irrigating solution or by coating the cornea with a topical ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD). Visual recovery may be delayed by exacerbation of the patient’s dry eye condition.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with dry eyes associated with collagen vascular disease, mucous membrane pemphigoid, rheumatoid arthritis, or Sjögren syndrome present a special challenge to the cataract surgeon. Close observation of these patients in the weeks following surgery is warranted to identify and treat toxic keratoconjunctivitis and corneal ulceration from collagenase activation by postoperative corticosteroid therapy. If prescribed, topical nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used with caution because of the increased risk of corneal melting associated with their use in these patients. In extreme cases, persistent epithelial defects with stromal loss may require a bandage (therapeutic) contact lens, tarsorrhaphy, or amniotic membrane transplant.</p>

			<p class="h2">Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyes with mucous membrane pemphigoid are severely dry due to scarring of the meibomian glands and accessory lacrimal glands and occlusion of the lacrimal gland orifices. Corneal haze or opacification impairs the surgeon’s view into the anterior segment during surgery. Extensive symblepharon or ankyloblepharon may limit positioning and exposure of the eye during surgery. The eyelid speculum must be positioned carefully to avoid traction and pressure on the globe.</p>
			<p class="h2">Exposure Keratitis and Seventh Nerve Palsy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with paralytic or mechanical eyelid abnormalities may have significant corneal dryness, which may be exacerbated by cataract surgery. Administration of topical anesthetics in the preoperative suite prior to surgery may desiccate the corneal epithelium. A peribulbar or retrobulbar block can cause a neurotrophic cornea for hours after surgery and may cause a large corneal abrasion unless a pressure patch is applied. Lubrication with antibiotic ointment may be necessary in the early postoperative period to facilitate healing of the epithelial surface and to control pain from an abrasion.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Corneal Conditions</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Corneal Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cornea has the most refractive power of any structure in the eye. Thus, prior to surgery, the surgeon should identify corneal abnormalities that might contribute to visual impairment and affect the degree of expected improvement in vision, including corneal scars, tear film abnormalities, and epithelial basement membrane dystrophy. An abnormal tear film should be addressed (see the sections Blepharitis and Acne Rosacea, and Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca, earlier in this chapter). Irregular astigmatism may degrade vision. Corneal topography is useful in diagnosing and quantifying irregular astigmatism resulting from a variety of corneal conditions. A trial gas-&#173;permeable contact lens can be used to mask an irregular astigmatism and help the clinician determine what effect astigmatism has on visual impairment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal irregularities affect the accuracy of keratometry and lead to erroneous lens power calculation. In an eye with epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, epithelial debridement may help produce a smoother corneal surface (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-2</span>). After debridement, it is necessary to wait at least 6–8&#160;weeks for the corneal surface to smooth and stabilize before repeating keratometry. Mild corneal stromal opacities in the presence of a pristine anterior refractive surface are unlikely to reduce vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with a history of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, epithelial or stromal keratitis may be exacerbated after cataract surgery. Although the Herpetic Eye Disease Study (HEDS) did not specifically address HSV following surgery, it did show that prophylactic treatment with oral acyclovir, 400&#160;mg, twice daily reduces the incidence of recurrent HSV keratitis. Because recurrent stromal keratitis may result in loss of visual acuity, many ophthalmologists use oral acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir perioperatively and observe the patient closely for recurrent keratitis postoperatively.</p>

			<p class="h2">Cataract and Keratoplasty</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When both cataract and corneal opacity contribute to a patient’s vision loss, the surgeon has 3&#160;options: (1)&#160;remove the cataract first; (2)&#160;repair the cornea first; or (3)&#160;combine the procedures. Removing the cataract first requires adequate visualization of the anterior segment; it may be possible in this circumstance to remove the cataract and monitor the patient for worsening corneal opacity. However, eyes that exhibit corneal endothelial dysfunction are at higher risk of corneal decompensation following cataract surgery. Signs and symptoms of corneal endothelial dysfunction are microcystic edema, stromal thickening, low cell count on specular microscopy, and/or diurnal fluctuations in vision with prolonged blurred vision upon waking. Keratoplasty should be performed in these eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) or an endothelial keratoplasty (EK) may be performed, either as primary surgery or as part of a combined procedure with cataract extraction (triple procedure). The advantages of performing keratoplasty as a stand-&#173;alone procedure include less postoperative inflammation and more reliable keratometry readings for future IOL power calculation. In patients who have primarily corneal endothelial disease, the advantages of EK over PKP include faster rehabilitation and more dependable keratometry readings with which to calculate IOL power, although a hyperopic shift from 0.50&#160;D to 1.50&#160;D may be encountered. IOL power calculation is less reliable for eyes that have undergone PKP than for those that have undergone EK.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A triple procedure (combined keratoplasty [PKP or EK], cataract extraction, and IOL implantation) may be chosen if both the cataract and the corneal disease are significant and the patient would benefit from concurrent treatment. The advantages of the triple procedure include a single visit to the operating room, which reduces the attendant perioperative surgical risks, and relatively rapid rehabilitation. The disadvantages of PKP with cataract surgery include less-&#173;predictable IOL calculation and a period of “open sky,” or exposure of intraocular contents while the cataract is removed and the IOL is placed, prior to replacement of the corneal button.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The advantages of EK with cataract surgery include rapid corneal rehabilitation with greater likelihood of regular astigmatism and relative ease of regrafting. Disadvantages include possible damage to grafted corneal endothelium when the additional entry into the anterior chamber is made, as well as possible disruption of the graft. Cornea surgeons find EK easier to perform in the aphakic or pseudophakic eye than in the phakic eye. (For a detailed discussion of keratoplasty procedures, see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the cataract is not the primary source of visual impairment, it may still be advisable to remove the cataract at the time of corneal surgery because of the eventual need for cataract removal, the possible progression of cataract due to prolonged postoperative corticosteroid therapy, and the risk of additional damage to the corneal endothelium during secondary surgery.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cataract Following Keratoplasty</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataract formation soon after keratoplasty may be caused by lens trauma during the transplantation procedure or by prolonged corticosteroid use to prevent graft rejection. Ideally, cataract surgery should be delayed until all PKP sutures are removed, the corneal contour and surface are stable, and accurate keratometry readings can be obtained for IOL power selection. The probability of graft survival 5&#160;years after cataract surgery is at least 80%; nevertheless, a corneal graft may not survive even routine cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Before surgery, the surgeon should evaluate the corneal graft for thickening and anticipate reduced intraoperative clarity through the graft. A scleral tunnel approach is farther from the corneal transplant and minimizes endothelial trauma during surgery. The risk of postoperative graft failure is minimized by protecting the corneal endothelium with a dispersive OVD during surgery and by aggressively treating postoperative inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Selecting the IOL power before the cornea is fully healed can lead to implantation of an incorrectly powered IOL and symptomatic anisometropia. Posterior chamber lenses are preferred because they minimize contact between the optic and the corneal endothelium. If capsular support is inadequate for IOL placement in the capsular bag (“in-the-bag”), a posterior chamber lens sutured to the sclera or iris may be placed. If the additional manipulation required for a sutured lens poses a risk of excessive endothelial trauma, insertion of a flexible anterior chamber IOL is an option.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cataract Following Refractive Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients who have undergone corneal refractive surgery and later develop a visually significant cataract present several unique challenges. Measurement of corneal power after refractive surgery is problematic, requiring multiple instruments and/or formulas to try to determine the new corneal power. Also, accurate axial length measurement with optical biometry or similar techniques is required. In addition, advanced IOL&#160;calculations must be used to determine the appropriate IOL power. (For a detailed discussion of IOL power calculation, see Chapter&#160;6 in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;13, <span class="italic">Refractive Surgery.</span>) Irregular astigmatism resulting from a refractive surgical procedure may compromise the ultimate visual outcome after cataract removal (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-3</span>). Because unanticipated postoperative refractive results may occur, the surgeon must thoroughly inform the patient about the limits of precision in lens power calculation and the possible requirement for postsurgical refractive correction to obtain optimal vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, postoperative hyperopia is more commonly encountered after cataract surgery in patients who have undergone previous refractive surgery. The corneal refractive incisions in eyes that have undergone radial keratotomy (RK) often swell after cataract surgery, thereby flattening the cornea and inducing hyperopia. Swelling may require more than 3&#160;months to resolve. If a clear corneal incision is chosen, it should be placed between the RK incisions. Violating an old RK incision can destabilize the wound, causing it to pull apart. The presence of multiple deep RK incisions or unstable wounds increases the likelihood of anterior chamber shallowing during cataract surgery and makes final closure of the wound difficult. A scleral tunnel incision is preferable to reduce the likelihood of violating an RK incision, unless adequate clearance between RK incisions can be ensured with a clear corneal approach.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In eyes that have undergone laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), the surgeon should make the clear corneal cataract incisions posterior enough and avoid a long tunnel that could disrupt the LASIK flap. Corneal swelling after LASIK may require more than 1&#160;month to resolve. Cataract surgery in eyes that have undergone photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) does not present the technical challenges of surgery in post-&#173;LASIK eyes.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Compromised Visualization of the Lens</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Small Pupil</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As discussed in Chapter&#160;6, operating through a small pupil may increase the risk of intra&#173;operative complications. Maximum pharmacologic pupil dilation should be noted in the preoperative evaluation so that the surgeon is adequately prepared for a small pupil. A small pupil that is minimally responsive to dilating agents may be widened intraoperatively using one of several techniques. Bimanually stretching the pupil with Kuglen or Lester hooks or tethering the iris with hooks (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-4</span>) or pupil-&#173;expansion devices (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-5</span>) breaks posterior synechiae and releases the pupillary sphincter. However, excessive manipulation of the iris with these instruments poses a risk of increased inflammation postoperatively. Also, the iris tends to be flaccid and floppy after manual stretching and release, and it is more likely to be damaged by the phaco tip. Viscodilation with a high-&#173;viscosity OVD is another method for enlarging a pupil.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To enlarge a small pupil resulting from intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS), most surgeons prefer pupil expansion devices, because progressive miosis of the floppy iris tends to occur as the surgery proceeds unless the pupil is held open mechanically (Video&#160;9-1). IFIS is a common cause of small pupils and is discussed in detail in Chapter&#160;8.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As discussed in Chapter&#160;7, creation of a continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC) is a key component of safe phacoemulsification. Conditions that cause an abnormal red reflex make it difficult for the surgeon to discriminate the capsular edge, thus increasing the risk of an incomplete or errant capsulorrhexis. In an eye with dense brunescent or cortical cataract, the capsule becomes subject to radial tears because of vaulting of the anterior capsule, which is due to increased lens thickness. Corneal scars not only compromise the surgeon’s view of the capsule but also make intraocular manipulation treacherous. Staining the capsule with trypan blue aids visualization and makes manipulation of the capsule easier (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-6</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prior to capsulotomy, anterior chamber fluid can be replaced with air, while a small amount of OVD is used to occlude the paracentesis site. Alternatively, a high-&#173;viscosity OVD can be instilled to fill approximately two-thirds of the anterior chamber. The surgeon then injects trypan blue through a 27-gauge blunt cannula, starting as far away from the paracentesis incision as possible to deliver the dye directly to the capsule. The dye is then rinsed out of the anterior chamber with balanced salt solution and replaced with a high-&#173;viscosity OVD, under which the stained anterior capsule is easily visible. The high-&#173;viscosity OVD exerts pressure on the anterior capsule, maintaining chamber depth and flattening the anterior capsule to prevent radial extension of the capsular tear. A CCC is then created (Video&#160;9-2).</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Intumescent Cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An intumescent cataract is swollen and enlarged with cortical material that often envelops a hard nucleus floating within the capsular bag. This type of cataract presents specific challenges during phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Intumescent cataracts have weak zonular fibers and fragile capsules. Because intumescence creates positive pressure in the capsular bag, the initial incision in the capsule may extend peripherally (Video&#160;9-3). The following steps can be performed to reduce the risk of such complications. The capsule should be stained with trypan blue and then the anterior chamber filled with high viscosity OVD (see the section Poor Red Reflex, earlier in this chapter). Prior to capsulotomy, the surgeon may place a 25- or 27-gauge needle attached to a syringe at the center of the anterior capsule. While suction is applied, the needle is used to pierce the anterior capsule and aspirate the milky cortex. This serves to decompress the lens to avoid radial extension of the CCC. Next, the use of a cystotome attached to the OVD syringe during creation of the CCC enables injection of additional OVD to clear away the milky egress. Caution is advised during phacoemulsification because the freely mobile lens makes segmentation challenging.</p>

			<p class="h2">Advanced Cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the case of dense, brunescent cataracts, surgical manipulation increases the risk of iris trauma, zonular tearing, capsular rupture, vitreous loss, and the dropping of lens fragments into the posterior segment. The increased ultrasound energy required for phacoemulsification of dense lenses increases the risk of endothelial trauma and wound burn. Creation of a larger capsulorrhexis is helpful, as it allows the surgeon to perform the maneuvers that are necessary to minimize these complications. Thorough hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the nucleus facilitate smooth rotation during phacoemulsification. When an initial groove is made in the hard nucleus, it is important that the surgeon make a deep and even pass so that the nucleus cracks without leaving interdigitations; such interdigitations interfere with removal and can lead to posterior capsule rupture. Viscodissection helps separate sticky cortical attachments that impede rotation. If the surgeon uses excessive mechanical force on a nucleus that does not freely rotate, zonular dialysis may result from transmittal of that force to the capsular bag. Mechanical segmentation techniques of nucleus disassembly, such as vertical and horizontal chopping, require less ultrasound energy and may induce less zonular stress than the “divide-and-&#173;conquer” method (discussed in Chapter&#160;7). Familiarity with multiple techniques, and the ability to switch from one technique to another as the situation requires, enable the surgeon to minimize complications. </p>
			<p class="body-text">If phacoemulsification ceases to be an appropriate technique for lens removal, conversion to an extracapsular technique should be considered. The surgeon must decide whether to proceed through the corneal incision by enlarging it to permit passage of the cataract and lens implant. Alternatively, the corneal wound can be closed and a new, larger corneoscleral incision created in the superior portion of the eye. The corneoscleral incision may be more stable, inducing less astigmatism postoperatively compared with a large corneal wound.</p>
			<p class="h2">Iris Coloboma and Corectopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Zonular dehiscence or absence commonly occurs in the area of iris coloboma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-7A</span>) or a misshapen pupil. Pharmacologic dilation reveals the extent of zonular abnormality. Iris hooks can be used intraoperatively to pull a flaccid iris out of the way. A capsular tension ring (CTR) that incorporates a coloboma diaphragm (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-7B</span>) not only helps stabilize the capsular bag but also serves as an artificial iris diaphragm. The surgeon also has the option of repairing the coloboma with a suture at the conclusion of the case.</p>
			<p class="h2">Posterior Polar Cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A weak or absent area of posterior lens capsule in the region of a posterior polar opacity places the eye at increased risk of capsular rupture during surgery. To minimize the likelihood of this complication, the surgeon should avoid creating excessive pressure within the capsular bag or placing excessive pressure on the posterior capsule. Complete hydrodissection is avoided because of possible tearing of the capsule directly under the opacity. Instead, small volumes of fluid are directed around the cortex up to but not across the opacity. Next, gentle hydrodelineation is performed, leaving a generous amount of epinuclear bowl in which to mobilize the nucleus and protect the capsule. Anterior chamber depth should be maintained and fluctuations in IOP controlled by low irrigation and aspiration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the nucleus is removed, OVD is used for viscodissection of the epinucleus from the capsular bag. The posterior polar opacity is removed last; viscodissection can be performed for this step as well. If the central portion of the posterior capsule is missing, filling the capsular bag with OVD before removing the irrigating phaco handpiece from the eye stabilizes the chamber for lens insertion. Alternatively, if the posterior polar opacity is very adherent, it can be left in place, assessed for its impact on vision postoperatively, and treated by laser capsulotomy if indicated. After the IOL is placed in the capsular bag in uncomplicated surgery, the surgeon should take care to minimize movement of the bag with slow and gentle OVD removal.</p>
			<p class="h2">Zonular Dehiscence With Lens Subluxation or Dislocation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Common causes of zonular incompetence include pseudoexfoliation syndrome (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-8</span>), ocular trauma, prior vitrectomy, prior trabeculectomy, and high myopia. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-&#173;Danlos syndrome, homocystinuria, hyperlysinemia, and Weill-&#173;Marchesani syndrome are less-&#173;common sources of inadequate zonular support. Iridodonesis detected at the slit lamp may be the initial finding that signals zonular weakness or absence. If the entire lens becomes dislocated into the posterior segment, surgical removal of the lens may not be required unless uveitis develops. In some cases, the remaining zonular fibers may tether the lens within the anterior vitreous such that when the patient sits upright at the slit lamp, the lens seems accessible for extraction. However, when the patient is supine during surgery, the lens may tilt backward and out of the surgeon’s reach. Thus, when iridodonesis or phacodonesis is detected preoperatively, it is helpful to confirm lens position with the patient supine during preoperative examination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Zonular status may be determined by direct visualization of the lens equator through a widely dilated pupil or by use of a goniolens to visualize zonular fibers behind the dilated pupil. In the preoperative examination, if zonular disruption encompasses over 120°, the surgeon may consider removal of the cataract using 1 of 2&#160;techniques: extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) or intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) (see the appendix).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Zonular incompetence becomes apparent intraoperatively with phacodonesis, decentration of the capsular bag, and sometimes vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber. If phacodonesis prevents the use of a CCC or if zonular disruption exceeds 120°, the surgeon may convert from phacoemulsification to ECCE or ICCE. Otherwise, phacoemulsification can proceed safely with application of the same measures recommended in the Advanced Cataract section, earlier in this chapter. Reducing the flow rate diminishes turbulence and fluctuation in anterior chamber depth, lowering the risk of vitreous prolapse through the area of zonular absence. A larger capsulorrhexis allows easier separation of lens components within the capsular bag. Thorough hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the nucleus facilitate smooth rotation during phacoemulsification. Viscodissection helps separate cortical attachments that may impede rotation. Excessive mechanical maneuvers in the nucleus, cortical aspiration, or inadvertent aspiration of the anterior capsule edge contributes to further zonular compromise. Viscodissection of cortical remnants and IOL insertion prior to complete cortical removal are maneuvers that help maintain capsular integrity. Tangential, rather than radial, removal of cortex from the bag minimizes zonular stress.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If capsular support is insufficient for safe phacoemulsification, capsular hooks or a CTR or CTR segments can be used (Videos&#160;9-4, 9-5). Capsular hooks (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-9</span>) support the anterior capsule edge in the area of weakened zonular fibers. They are placed through paracentesis incisions, and adjustment of tension on each hook recenters the capsule for phacoemulsification. CTRs provide support by exerting centrifugal force against the capsule equator to areas of absent or weakened zonular fibers.</p>

			<p class="body-text">Because radial tension may further extend the capsular defect, placement of either capsular hooks or a CTR should be avoided if the anterior capsule is torn radially or if the capsulorrhexis is interrupted. The ring can be used in patients with posterior capsule defects as long as the anterior rhexis remains continuous. With a CTR in position, the surgeon can proceed to nuclear and cortical removal more safely and place the chosen IOL in the capsular bag (“in-the-bag” IOL). Insufficient zonular support can also be managed with a modified CTR or CTR segment sutured to the scleral wall. In the setting of severe instability, working in conjunction with a vitreoretinal surgeon to employ a pars plana approach may be advisable.</p>

			<p class="h2">Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyes with pseudoexfoliation are characterized by poor pupillary dilation and weakened zonular fibers. These findings increase the likelihood of intraoperative complications such as lens dislocation, capsular rupture, and vitreous loss. The techniques suggested for safe cataract surgery in these eyes are the same as those for advanced cataract and zonular dehiscence (discussed earlier in this chapter). Progressive capsular contraction, or capsular phimosis, is common in eyes with pseudoexfoliation. Possible dislocation of the implant into the vitreous is of concern. The surgeon should carefully consider the style of and placement for the chosen lens implant. Capsular contraction is less likely with a 3-piece lens placed inside the capsular bag. If capsular phimosis occurs, an Nd:YAG laser may be used to create radial incisions in the anterior capsule to release tension on the zonular fibers and maintain central lens position.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cataract in Aniridia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens capsule in patients with aniridia is thinner and thus inherently more fragile than that in patients with normal lenses, which makes creation of a capsulorrhexis more challenging. Ideally, the edge of a well-&#173;centered capsulorrhexis should overlap the optic edge by 1&#160;mm. Corneal haze and neovascularization in these eyes are common because of stem cell deficiency; capsular staining may aid visualization through the cornea during creation of an adequately sized capsular opening. Use of a high-&#173;viscosity OVD also optimizes visualization while stabilizing the capsular surface. The surgeon should avoid working inside the capsular bag to eliminate potential tension on the capsular rim. Low infusion helps reduce turbulence and capsular fluctuation. The capsule in aniridic eyes acts as a pseudoiris when it opacifies.</p>

			<p class="h1">Conditions Associated With Extremes in Axial Length</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top7">
			<p class="h2-h1">High Myopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When the surgeon introduces the phaco tip into the anterior chamber of a highly myopic eye, the chamber may deepen dramatically, making lens manipulation difficult. To avoid extensive deepening of the anterior chamber, the surgeon is advised to lower the irrigation bottle and increase the flow rate before entering the eye with the phaco tip. Placing a second instrument between the iris and the anterior capsule prior to turning on infusion may prevent excess deepening. Despite this maneuver, these eyes are susceptible to lens–iris diaphragm retropulsion syndrome (LIDRS), wherein 360° of iridocapsular contact occurs, causing reverse pupillary block, pupillary dilation, and pain. A defect or laxity in the zonular fibers predisposes myopic eyes to LIDRS. Manual separation of the iris from the anterior capsule rim using a sideport instrument corrects the situation (see Chapter&#160;8).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Preoperative IOL power calculation for myopic eyes indicates whether a special-&#173;order IOL such as a plano-&#173;power or minus-&#173;power implant is required. Whenever possible, the patient should receive an IOL because the lens implant serves as a barrier to the movement of the vitreous base and associated traction on the retina. Because myopic eyes are at increased risk of retinal detachment postoperatively, acrylic lens implants are favored when there is a strong possibility that the patient will later undergo vitreoretinal surgery. During vitreoretinal surgery, in the setting of an open posterior capsule, silicone IOLs develop condensation that compromises the retinal surgeon’s view into the eye. Silicone lenses have also been observed to migrate through the capsular opening into the vitreous.</p>

			<p class="h2">High Hyperopia and Nanophthalmos</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The eye of a cataract patient with high hyperopia (axial length &lt;22&#160;mm) often has a shallow anterior chamber and is prone to uveal prolapse, iris damage, and excessive corneal endothelial trauma during cataract surgery. Anterior chamber deepening and intraocular tissue protection are achieved by using a high-&#173;viscosity OVD, a low aspiration rate, or elevation of the irrigation bottle prior to insertion of the phaco tip. Mannitol can be administered preoperatively to dehydrate the vitreous volume in a patient with no systemic contraindications to use of this medication. Iris prolapse is avoided by using an anterior corneal incision entry and by taking care not to overfill the eye with OVD. If all of these measures fail to provide sufficient anterior chamber volume for cataract removal, a small amount of liquid vitreous can be removed using a 25-gauge needle or vitrectomy handpiece through a pars plana puncture.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nanophthalmos is a rare condition in which the eye is extremely short (axial length &lt;20.5&#160;mm) and the ratio of lens volume to eye volume is larger than normal. These eyes have shallow anterior chambers, narrow angles, and thickened sclerae, with little room for the surgeon to maneuver. Small-&#173;incision bimanual surgery is an alternative technique to consider. Intraoperative or postoperative uveal effusion is a unique hazard in nanophthalmic eyes. Maintaining positive pressure in the anterior chamber and limiting the length of the procedure aid in preventing intraoperative uveal effusion. Scleral windows should be considered as a prophylactic measure to treat uveal effusion. A sutured wound prevents hypotony from contributing to this complication postoperatively.</p>
			<p class="h2">Hypotony</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A shortened axial length with choroidal thickening is often accompanied by chronic hypotony and posterior scleral flattening. Hypotony makes biometry technically challenging and precise calculation of IOL power less predictable. To the extent possible, the clinician should determine the cause of hypotony and undertake specific treatment before cataract surgery. If the cataract obscures examination of the posterior segment, B-scan ultrasonography is helpful in revealing posterior segment pathology. A cyclodialysis cleft or retinal detachment requires a more extensive procedure combined with cataract surgery. Severe hypotony or pre-&#173;phthisis is a poor prognostic indicator for improvement in vision after cataract extraction.</p>

			<p class="h1">Glaucoma and Cataract</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top8">
			<p class="h2-h1">Assessment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When cataract surgery is being considered in a patient with glaucoma, assessment of the patient’s glaucoma control is incorporated into the surgical plan. It is challenging to predict the visual outcome in an eye with both cataract and glaucoma because both conditions may contribute to blurred vision, and the patient’s visual symptoms may not be directly attributable to one condition or the other exclusively. An advanced visual field defect may limit visual improvement after cataract surgery. In contrast, an advanced cataract may exaggerate a mild visual field abnormality (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-10</span>). Surgical options include cataract surgery alone, combined cataract and glaucoma surgery, and staged procedures of glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy or tube shunt) followed by cataract surgery at a later time. Uncomplicated phacoemulsification alone may serve to lower the long-term IOP by 10%–34% in some eyes. Novel glaucoma procedures, collectively termed microinvasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS), such as canaloplasty, endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation (ECP), trabecular microbypass (iStent, Glaukos Corp, Laguna Hills, CA), and ab interno trabeculotomy (Trabectome, NeoMedix Inc, Tustin, CA) are amenable to combination with cataract extraction to further reduce IOP in a blebless, conjunctiva-&#173;sparing manner. Further randomized trials may determine the efficacy of these procedures compared with trabeculectomy, with one another, and with phacoemulsification alone. Small-&#173;incision cataract surgery with a clear corneal approach minimizes conjunctival damage, an essential consideration if filtering surgery is required in the future. In addition, a small incision at a temporal or superotemporal location makes cataract surgery in an eye with a functioning filtering bleb much easier, and it is also less likely to compromise IOP control by an existing functioning bleb. Issues that influence surgical approach include preoperative and desired postoperative IOP level, degree of damage to the optic nerve and visual field, number of medications required to control IOP, patient adherence, side effects of medication, and impact on quality of life. For a comprehensive discussion of surgical decision making in the glaucomatous eye as well as combined cataract and glaucoma surgery, see BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Most of the surgical challenges in patients with both glaucoma and cataract are not unique to these eyes. For instance, zonular compromise and phacodonesis may complicate capsulorrhexis creation and lens removal in an eye with traumatic or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma. Uveitic glaucoma and miotic therapy may limit pupillary dilation and increase the risk of postoperative macular edema. Postoperative IOP elevation from retained OVD or inflammation occurs more commonly, and pressure rises to a higher level in glaucomatous eyes with reduced outflow through the trabecular meshwork. Management of these operative challenges is discussed in detail elsewhere in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The use of topical prostaglandin medication has been associated with postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME), although proven cases are few. Because the occurrence of clinically significant postoperative CME after uncomplicated phacoemulsification is rare, it is difficult to attribute macular edema in the early postoperative period to the use of prostaglandin medication. In such cases, discontinuation of the prostaglandin is advisable to determine whether this medication is contributing to the edema.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Cataract Surgery in an Eye With a Functioning Filter</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Small-incision cataract surgery in the glaucomatous eye provides the surgeon with options that do not interfere with previous filtering surgery. With a temporal corneal incision, the surgeon avoids the superior conjunctiva and site of filtering surgery. If conversion to an extracapsular technique is indicated (eg, in the setting of extreme phacodonesis and zonular instability or capsular rupture with vitreous present in the anterior chamber), the surgeon may choose to extend the clear corneal incision to permit delivery of the crystalline lens. Alternatively, closure of the temporal incision and creation of a larger corneoscleral incision superiorly minimize astigmatism but may also compromise an existing filter. Aggressive control of postoperative inflammation is critical to ensure continued bleb function.</p>

			<p class="h1">Uveitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top9">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chronic or recurring uveitis, as well as the corticosteroid therapy used to treat it, contributes to cataract formation. Decreased vision due to cataract must be differentiated from coexisting macular edema or posterior segment pathology. Fluorescein angiography or optical coherence tomography should be used preoperatively to identify CME. Complications can be minimized when inflammation has been controlled for several months before surgery and is treated aggressively after surgery. Topical and oral corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy, and topical NSAIDs and cytotoxic agents may be used to supplement treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Uveitic eyes dilate poorly and require expansion and lysis of iridolenticular adhesions, as discussed previously for small pupils. A pupillary membrane must be incised and stripped to avoid interference with the capsulorrhexis. Overly vigorous pupil stretching and manipulation lead to iris bleeding and fibrinous inflammation postoperatively. Meticulous cleanup of cortical material helps prevent exuberant postoperative inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Insertion of a silicone lens implant is discouraged because inflammatory precipitates may collect on the lens surface (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-11</span>). Acrylic posterior chamber IOLs placed in the capsular bag are well tolerated and preferred in uveitic eyes. When complications arise and a lens cannot be inserted into the capsular bag, it may be advisable to omit placing a lens in the ciliary sulcus or implanting an anterior chamber lens. Other options may include leaving the patient aphakic or using a scleral-&#173;fixated lens. In types of uveitis associated with membrane formation, repeated Nd:YAG procedures may be necessary to clear the lens surface.

			<p class="h1">Retinal Conditions</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top10">
			<p class="h2-h1">Retinal Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Review of ocular records of the patient with retinal disease may reveal the visual acuity before the onset of cataract. Macular function tests, such as the macular photostress test or the potential acuity test (see Chapter&#160;6), may help predict the visual outcome in patients with retinal disease. The clinician must interpret test results with caution because poor or equivocal performance on such tests does not rule out all benefit from cataract removal, whereas favorable results may be misleading. Optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography can detect the presence of diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy, degenerative changes, macular distortion, and leakage of fluid into the foveal area. Proper management of patient expectations is essential and especially prudent when eyes have vision-&#173;threatening retinal disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If diabetic macular edema is present and the view of the retina is adequate, the clinician may consider preoperative focal laser treatment or intravitreal injections of steroids or anti-&#173;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medications. Ideally, cataract surgery should be delayed until the macular edema has resolved; this may take several months. The clinician may also consider perioperative administration of topical NSAIDs, as studies have shown that this may decrease the incidence of postoperative CME and that NSAIDs are beneficial in preventing macular edema in patients with diabetes mellitus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the patient is known to have peripheral vitreoretinopathy, a retina specialist should examine the patient before surgery to determine whether pretreatment with laser or cryotherapy would help reduce the risk of retinal tears or detachment. After prophylactic treatment, a period of at least 4&#160;weeks should elapse before elective cataract surgery. (See also BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the view of the retina is restricted by a small pupil preoperatively, cataract surgery provides an opportunity to enlarge the pupil using stretch maneuvers, iris hooks, expansion devices, or multiple sphincterotomies. In addition, a generous anterior capsulotomy and complete cortical cleanup will enhance the view of the retinal periphery after surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Whenever safely possible, the patient should receive a posterior chamber IOL. A silicone IOL should be avoided in a patient for whom vitrectomy is anticipated because, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, condensation on the posterior surface of the implant limits visibility during pars plana vitrectomy.</p>

			<p class="h2">Cataract Following Pars Plana Vitrectomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nuclear cataract formation is common after pars plana vitrectomy, especially in patients older than 50&#160;years. Posterior subcapsular opacification is typical after the use of silicone oil during retinal surgery. In the absence of a vitreous cushion, the posterior capsule becomes more mobile; thus, the surgeon must pay careful attention to fluctuations in anterior chamber depth, avoiding surge upon breaking of vacuum when a piece of lens is aspirated (see Chapter&#160;7). Lowering the irrigation bottle and fluid-&#173;flow rate prior to placing the phaco tip inside the eye is helpful. This maneuver is also recommended when zonular integrity is altered as a result of prior retinal surgery or preexisting ocular disease. The surgeon should beware of overfilling the anterior chamber with OVD in an effort to avoid further zonular stretch and breakage. Extra caution is also necessary to avoid losing pieces of the lens during hydrodissection when an inadvertent capsular break may have occurred during retinal surgery. A large capsulorrhexis allows prolapse of the nucleus during hydrodissection for an iris-&#173;plane phaco chop. If the surgeon selects an extracapsular surgical technique instead of phacoemulsification, the absence of vitreous reduces posterior pressure to aid lens expression. Alternatively, after capsulorrhexis and hydrodissection of the nucleus from its cortical attachments, the nucleus can be removed using a lens loop or irrigating vectis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cataract With Intraocular Silicone Oil</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataract in an eye with silicone oil is usually very soft. The surgeon should avoid pressurizing the eye with excessive OVD or the high infusion pressure of balanced salt solution. During cataract surgery, silicone oil can migrate through a break in the zonular fibers if the anterior chamber is overfilled with OVD. The clinician should use low-flow irrigation or decrease the aspiration rate during surgery to minimize pressure on the zonular fibers and the risk of silicone oil migration into the anterior chamber. Droplets of silicone oil that were not apparent in the anterior chamber during surgery might become visible postoperatively. A few droplets are usually not toxic to the cornea. Silicone lens implants are contraindicated in these eyes because silicone oil adheres to the implant surface. The surgeon should create an inferior iridotomy if a patent one is not already present. (See Chapter&#160;6 for a discussion of IOL calculations in eyes with silicone oil.)</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-22">Ocular Trauma</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top11">
			<p class="h2-h1">Ocular Assessment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When a patient presents with a history of ocular trauma sufficient to cause a dense cataract, the surgeon should suspect damage to other anterior segment structures. Damage to the corneal endothelium, zonular fibers, and anterior chamber angle all require an adjustment in surgical technique. Gonioscopy is essential when planning IOL placement. The surgeon must be hypervigilant when evaluating ocular findings and determining the potential for visual recovery (discussed in Chapter&#160;6). Cataract may occur acutely after substantial trauma (see Chapter&#160;5). A slowly progressive cataract after ocular trauma can be monitored while intraocular inflammation and other comorbidities are treated. The following sections discuss conditions related to and processes affected by the traumatized eye.</p>
			<p class="h2">Visualization During Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal laceration and edema may impair the view into the eye such that phacoemulsification cannot be performed safely. Instead, an extracapsular approach may be advisable. Hemorrhage during surgery may further reduce visualization of the anterior segment. Use of OVDs and injection of intracameral air help occlude vessels and marginalize bleeding. If visualization remains inadequate, the surgeon should close the wound and pursue surgery later.</p>
			<p class="h2">Inflammation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute and chronic inflammation are common in traumatized eyes. When uveitis is severe, it may mimic infectious endophthalmitis. Fibrin membranes on the iris lead to synechiae formation, pupil seclusion, and miosis. The surgeon should use pupil-&#173;enlarging maneuvers, as described previously in the section Small Pupil. In the setting of inflammation, a peripheral iridotomy is important for prevention of pupillary block glaucoma. Inflamed uveal tissue bleeds upon the slightest manipulation. OVDs should be used liberally to protect corneal endothelium and to improve the view into the anterior segment. Postoperative IOP elevation is typical and exacerbated by the use of OVD. Control of inflammation warrants cycloplegia as well as intensive topical and possibly oral corticosteroid therapy.</p>
			<p class="h2">Retained Foreign Matter</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A foreign body in the anterior chamber may be easier to see when the patient is seated upright at the slit lamp rather than positioned supine under the operating microscope. Irrigating solutions may dislodge a foreign body from its preoperative location. When an intraocular foreign body is suspected to be located in the posterior segment, indirect ophthalmoscopy is an excellent method to use if ocular media are sufficiently clear. When the view is obscured by cataract or hemorrhage, a computed tomography scan, x-ray, or ultrasonogram can help the clinician determine the presence and location of the foreign body. When a metallic foreign body is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging is contraindicated because the magnetic field could dislodge the foreign body. A dense cataract may be removed by either a pars plana or an anterior approach, followed by pars plana vitrectomy and removal of the foreign body.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cataract in an Eye With Damage to Other Ocular Tissues</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Iris trauma commonly coexists with traumatic cataract (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-12</span>). Sphincter ruptures cause irregular pupil size and shape. The surgeon can repair iridodialysis at the time of cataract removal by suturing the iris root to the scleral spur. Though not apparent on slit-lamp examination, corneal endothelial damage can be significant and may not manifest until after surgery, when severe corneal edema occurs. Preoperative specular microscopy can be helpful in determining the status of the corneal endothelium and its ability to withstand cataract surgery. Trauma sufficient to cause iris tears and cataract also warrants careful inspection for zonular damage and posterior segment insult. Surgical planning to manage these findings intraoperatively is discussed in earlier sections of this chapter. If a retinal detachment is present, cataract removal may be necessary to allow adequate visualization for subsequent surgical repair.</p>
			<p class="h2">Removal of Traumatic Cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A traumatic cataract may leak lens protein into the aqueous and vitreous, inciting uveitis and glaucoma. If cortical material is identified in the anterior chamber or if a mature cataract interferes with the diagnosis and treatment of injuries in the posterior segment, the cataract should be removed promptly. Rupture of the capsule causes rapid hydration of the lens cortex, leading to formation of a milky-&#173;white cataract. This type of cataract is usually soft and can be aspirated through the large port of the irrigating/aspirating handpiece. The surgeon should beware of preexisting capsule rupture that may not be visible on preoperative examination. Hydrodissection should be performed slowly to minimize the possibility of extending a capsular break and causing the lens to fall into the posterior segment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If a hard nuclear cataract was present before the trauma, the surgeon should employ techniques for cataract removal (described in the section Zonular Dehiscence With Lens Subluxation or Dislocation, earlier in this chapter). An OVD can be used to provide a tamponade to anterior vitreous movement in areas of zonular incompetence. If vitreous has migrated into the anterior chamber, the surgeon must perform an anterior vitrectomy before removing the lens in order to avoid vitreous manipulation and retinal traction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When the nucleus is markedly subluxed and vitreous fills a substantial part of the anterior chamber, the surgeon should consider a pars plana lensectomy, in collaboration with a retinal surgeon (see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Vision Rehabilitation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Primary implantation of a posterior chamber lens after ocular trauma is recommended when intraocular inflammation and hemorrhage are minimal and the view of anterior segment structures is good. An anterior chamber IOL or transsclerally fixated posterior chamber lens may be necessary in case there is inadequate capsular support for a posterior chamber IOL. In rare situations, the surgeon may decide against placing an IOL primarily and instead insert an IOL as a secondary procedure later, after sufficient evaluation of the anterior segment and anterior angle anatomy. Scarring resulting from a corneal laceration changes the contour of the cornea, and inaccurate keratometry and biometry measurements can result in erroneous IOL power selection, increasing the risk of postoperative anisometropia. A rigid contact lens may be required to mask irregular astigmatism resulting from a corneal scar.</p>
			<p class="h2">IOL Selection After Trauma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician should tailor selection of a lens implant to the patient’s ocular anatomy and to the desired postoperative outcome. As mentioned earlier, silicone lens implants should be avoided in patients with a history of uveitis; inflammatory debris is more likely to collect on the surface of this type of optic (see Fig&#160;9-11) and impair vision than it is on hydrophobic acrylic IOLs. Acrylic lenses are preferred in these cases and in eyes that are more likely to undergo vitreoretinal surgery in the future. In eyes that have more than 4&#160;clock-hours of inadequate zonular support but have an intact anterior capsule, a 3-piece posterior chamber lens may be placed in the ciliary sulcus. Alternatively, if there is no capsular support, a 3-piece lens may be sewn to the scleral wall. Finally, the design of current anterior chamber lenses is sufficiently flexible for the open-&#173;angle glaucomatous eye to tolerate. Ultimately, the choice of IOL is determined by the surgeon’s experience with lens options and implantation methods.</p>
