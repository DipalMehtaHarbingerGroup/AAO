			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> The rate of cataract surgery varies widely: in developed countries, it is up to 10,000 per million population per year, while in parts of the developing world, the rate may be as low as 50 surgeries per million. The World Health Organization has set a goal of 3000 surgeries per million population annually to adequately address the worldwide need for cataract extraction.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;2.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">a.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> With age, the human lens develops an increasingly curved shape, which results in more refractive power. This change may be accompanied by—and in some cases offset by—a decrease in the index of refraction of the lens, probably resulting from an increase in &#173;water-&#173;insoluble proteins. As a result, either a myopic or hyperopic shift in refraction may occur.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;3.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> After fetal development, the lens has no blood supply or organelles and depends on the aqueous humor for removal of metabolic waste. Changes in lens size occur throughout life as the lens epithelial cells at the equator continue to divide. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;4.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Glutathione and vitamins E and C are powerful free radical scavengers. They have no effect on the pH or the corneal endothelium. They actually protect DNA from being damaged by free radicals. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;5.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">a.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> The Helmholtz theory of accommodation, developed in the mid-1800s, remains widely accepted. It is based on the presumption that, when a distance target is viewed, the eye’s ciliary muscle is relaxed, causing the zonular fibers to flatten the central anterior surface of the lens. Conversely, when the eye attempts to focus on a near object, the ciliary muscle contracts, relaxing the tension on the zonular fibers. The central anterior surface of the </span><span class="CharOverride-9">lens is allowed to bulge, resulting in an increase in dioptric power. Despite the fact that the </span><span class="CharOverride-9">central posterior capsule is the thinnest part of the capsule, there is no change in curvature of the posterior aspect of the lens with contraction or relaxation of the ciliary muscle.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;6.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> The hexokinase reaction is the &#173;rate-&#173;limiting step in glucose phosphorylation. When glucose concentration increases in the lens, the sorbitol pathway is activated; aldose reductase is the key enzyme in this pathway. Sorbitol is retained in the lens because of poor permeability, promoting lens opacification.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;7.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">a.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Terminal differentiation involves elongation of the lens epithelial cells into lens fibers. This change is associated with a tremendous increase in the mass of cellular proteins in the fiber cell membrane. The cells lose organelles, including nuclei, mitochondria, and ribosomes. The loss of cell organelles is optically advantageous; however, the cells then become more dependent on glycolysis for energy production and less active metabolically.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;8.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Y-sutures are formed when the ends of the secondary lens fibers of the fetal nucleus meet and interdigitate with the ends of fibers arising on the opposite side of the lens. An erect Y-suture appears anteriorly; an inverted Y-suture, posteriorly. In a clear or mildly cataractous adult lens, the Y-sutures can be seen in the center of the nucleus. The junction of the adult nucleus and the surrounding cortex is generally not visible but may be appreciated once the nucleus develops sclerosis; there is no morphologic distinction between the cortex and the nucleus. The tunica vasculosa lentis, a capillary network on the posterior surface of the lens capsule, regresses at approximately 9 weeks of gestation. A remnant may persist as a small opacity (Mittendorf dot).</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;9.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Careful refraction improves vision in many patients with Marfan syndrome. Presbyopic correction may be required, even in young patients with this syndrome, as the subluxated lens lacks accommodative power because of the abnormal function of the zonular fibers. The position of the subluxated lens may remain stable over time, and lens surgery in patients with Marfan syndrome carries a high risk of complications; thus, lens extraction should be deferred until more conservative management is unsuccessful in achieving adequate vision. Prism correction is not indicated, because the diplopia that occurs with lens subluxation is most often monocular. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;10.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Glare is a common symptom of cortical cataracts. &#173;Near-&#173;vision preference occurs most commonly in patients with nuclear cataracts, as does a myopic shift. In patients with advanced nuclear cataracts, impaired color perception is common. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;11.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Posterior migration of lens epithelial cells and their enlargement are the typical histologic changes associated with posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSCs). Lamellar membrane whorls are seen on electron microscopy of nuclear cataracts. Calcium deposition is seen in hypermature cataracts. Glycosaminoglycan deposition is not a feature of cataracts. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;12.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Chalcosis occurs when an intraocular foreign body deposits copper in the Descemet membrane, anterior lens capsule, or other intraocular basement membranes. The term “sunflower” cataract refers to a &#173;petal-&#173;shaped deposition of yellow or brown pigment in the lens capsule that radiates from the anterior axial pole of the lens to the equator. Oil droplet cataracts can occur in galactosemia and posterior lenticonus, and the term is used to describe some dense nuclear cataracts. The “oil droplet” appearance of dense nuclear cataracts in galactosemia is due to a great difference between the density of the central nucleus and that of the surrounding cortex. The oil droplet appearance noted on red reflex examination in cases of posterior lenticonus is due to a bulge in the posterior capsule. In all of these cases, the best way to view the oil droplet is with retinoscopy or with direct ophthalmoscopy using a &#173;wide-&#173;angle view. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;13.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Phacolytic glaucoma occurs when denatured lens protein leaks through an intact but permeable capsule. The trabecular meshwork becomes clogged with the lens proteins and engorged macrophages. In phacomorphic glaucoma, the mature lens causes pupillary block and secondary angle closure. In phacoantigenic uveitis, leaking of lens protein produces a granulomatous inflammatory reaction. Lens particle glaucoma is associated with a penetrating lens injury or surgery.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;14.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> B-scan ultrasonography is indicated to screen for retinal detachment, posterior staphyloma, occult tumors, or other posterior pathology that could affect the visual outcome. The potential acuity pinhole test and fluorescein angiography would not be possible with such a dense cataract. Specular microscopy would be indicated only if signs of corneal endothelial dysfunction were present.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;15.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> In most cases, cataract surgery is an elective procedure. In determining whether surgery is the most appropriate option, the ophthalmologist must assess not only the clinical findings, but also the impact of vision changes on the patient’s daily activities and lifestyle. Questionnaires for measuring visual function may be useful tools for evaluation and documentation.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;16.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> To obtain accurate measurements, optical biometers require adequate clarity of the cornea, aqueous, lens, and vitreous. In the setting of significant corneal scarring, PSC, or vitreous hemorrhage, biometry may not be obtainable, and an immersion technique or contact applanation would be more appropriate. Adjustments need to be made to biometry calculations when there are alterations in the average velocity through the ocular media, such as in the setting of aphakia or silicone oil in the posterior chamber. However, accurate measurements can still be achieved if these factors are taken into account.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;17.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Improper selection of an intraocular lens (IOL) is a preventable cause of a “refractive surprise.” All information related to calculations for the patient’s IOL should be available to the surgeon in the operating room. Before the procedure begins, the entire surgical team should participate in a “time-out” to confirm the patient’s identity, the operative eye, the procedure, and the IOL to be implanted.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;18.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Possible complications of retrobulbar anesthesia include the following: retrobulbar hemorrhage; globe penetration; optic nerve trauma; extraocular muscle toxicity; intravenous injection with cardiac arrhythmia; and inadvertent intradural injection with associated seizures, respiratory arrest, and brainstem anesthesia. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers-cont">In this case, there was an increased risk of retrobulbar hemorrhage due to anticoagulation. The goal of treatment is to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP) as quickly as possible. Cataract surgery should not be performed, because the risk of iris prolapse through the wound and expulsive choroidal hemorrhage is increased. </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;19.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> The prevention of endophthalmitis is a &#173;much-&#173;debated topic. On the day of surgery, the use of 5% &#173;povidone-&#173;iodine solution in the fornix has been shown to decrease bacterial colony counts. However, vigorous scrubbing of the eyelids and lashes is generally not recommended, as doing so may actually disseminate bacteria onto the ocular surface immediately prior to surgery. Systemic antibiotics do not adequately penetrate an intact globe. While minimizing repeated manipulation of instruments over the eyelashes and in the eye is recommended, making a large incision for an extracapsular extraction would not be advised. Appropriate eyelid hygiene preoperatively would be the recommended course of action in this case.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;20.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Protecting the corneal endothelium with a coating agent, or dispersive ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD), would be recommended for an eye with cornea guttae. A cohesive agent, while maintaining space, would be easily expelled from the eye during phacoemulsification. Prolapsing the lens into a supracapsular position for phacoemulsification would not necessarily be helpful, as the phaco tip would then be closer to the endothelium. Unless corneal edema is observed preoperatively, the surgeon would not plan for a keratoplasty until some months postoperatively. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;21.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Causes of a shallow anterior chamber postoperatively include wound leak, capsular block, pupillary block, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, and ciliary block. If the cause is known to be ciliary block glaucoma and the other conditions are ruled out, initial treatment with cycloplegia and aqueous suppressants may relieve the condition. A peripheral iridotomy, while effective for pupillary block, does not relieve ciliary block. If the initial medical treatment fails, surgical disruption of the vitreous face or a vitrectomy may be necessary at a later time to permanently restore the normal aqueous circulation and anterior chamber depth.</span></p>

Elevated IOP shortly after surgery may be due to retained OVDs and may cause decreased vision, pain, and a central epithelial edema (“bedewing”). Endophthalmitis typically presents 3–10 days after surgery with pain, decreased vision, and anterior chamber and anterior vitreous inflammation.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;24.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Negative dysphotopsia (ND) is caused by the shadow (penumbra) cast on the nasal retina as light rays entering the eye from the temporal periphery interact with the nasal edge of a &#173;well-&#173;centered IOL in the capsular bag. It is seen with all types of IOLs placed in the capsular bag but is most common with smaller, &#173;square-&#173;edge optic designs. ND does not occur with anterior chamber IOLs. A 1-piece acrylic IOL in the ciliary sulcus increases the risk of &#173;uveitis-&#173;glaucoma-hyphema syndrome but not ND. Decentered posterior chamber IOLs of all types are associated with positive dysphotopsias.  </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;25.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Fluctuating vision that is worse in the morning indicates significant corneal endothelial dysfunction, which is an indication for keratoplasty (penetrating or endothelial). Concurrent removal of a cataract is indicated if the cataract is visually significant or likely to pro&#173;gress rapidly. Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy may require corneal debridement, not keratoplasty. Peripheral corneal scarring is unlikely to be visually significant. A dense cataract with mild endothelial dystrophy should generally be treated with cataract surgery alone.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;26.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">a.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Corneal topography is useful to determine whether there is irregular astigmatism, as well as to help determine the true corneal power. While optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the anterior segment may provide useful measurements, such as anterior chamber depth and corneal thickness, macular OCT does not assist in the calculation of IOL power. Immersion A-scan ultrasonography may be used in place of optical biometry, but contact A-scan is not accurate enough for IOL calculation in patients who have undergone refractive surgery.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;27.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">a.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Iris hooks and pupil expansion devices are both very useful in dealing with IFIS. However, when the pupil becomes miotic during surgery, after creation of a continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC), iris hooks are a safer choice. A possible complication of Malyugin ring insertion after CCC is that the ring may inadvertently catch the edge of the capsulorrhexis. Iris hooks can be used to dilate the iris in a more controlled manner in this situation. Bimanual pupil stretching is not likely to keep the pupil sufficiently dilated and does not address the excessive motility of the floppy iris. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;28.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> The surgeon should always be prepared for likely complications by having alternative surgical plans ready and the appropriate instruments available in the operating room. Staining the capsule of a white cataract aids direct visualization and promotes creation of a controlled CCC. Trypan blue dye would certainly be advantageous for capsular staining. If a pupil is miotic or there is zonular weakness, the surgeon should be ready to use other devices as the situation dictates.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-9">&#9;29.&#9;</span><span class="CharOverride-10">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> For a patient with 90° of zonular dialysis, management consists of continued phacoemulsification and capsular tension ring (CTR) placement. The timing of the CTR placement depends on the extent of the zonular compromise and the surgeon’s preference. Placement of the CTR before completion of phacoemulsification stabilizes the capsule for further lens manipulation and extraction but makes cortical aspiration more difficult. Thorough cortical aspiration is easier if CTR placement is delayed until just before IOL insertion. However, there is a risk of extending the zonular dialysis if phacoemulsification is performed without adequate capsule support. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers-cont">The flow rate and bottle height should not be increased, as doing so could cause vitreous to prolapse through the dialysis and into the anterior chamber. OVD may be used as a tamponade against the forward movement of vitreous in the area of the dialysis. Unless the situation deteriorates further, neither conversion to extracapsular cataract extraction nor use of an anterior chamber IOL would be necessary.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;30.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-10">a.</span><span class="CharOverride-9"> Uveitic eyes dilate poorly and require pupil expansion. This may be achieved in a variety of ways, including bimanual stretching, iris hooks, or pupil expansion devices. In an eye with controlled uveitis, an IOL should be placed. An acrylic IOL is well tolerated and preferred over a silicone IOL because of the risk of inflammatory precipitates collecting on the silicone IOL surface postoperatively.</span></p>
