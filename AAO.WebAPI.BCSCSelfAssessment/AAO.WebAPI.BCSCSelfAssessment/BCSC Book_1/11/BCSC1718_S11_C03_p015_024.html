			<p class="h2-h1">Crystallin Proteins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The human lens has a protein concentration of 33% of its wet weight, which is at least twice that of most tissues. Lens proteins are commonly divided into 2&#160;groups, based on water solubility (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-1</span>). The water-&#173;soluble fraction of the young lens accounts for approximately 80% of lens proteins; aging-&#173;related changes result in an increase in the percentage of water-&#173;insoluble protein. The water-&#173;soluble portion consists mainly of a group of proteins called <span class="italic">crystallins.</span> The crystallins can be divided into 2&#160;major groups, &#173;<span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-crystallins and <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>,<span class="greek--tx-">c</span>-crystallins.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-Crystallins represent about one-third of the lens proteins by mass. In their native state, they are the largest of the crystallins, with a molecular mass ranging between 600 and 800&#160;kDa. In addition, they may associate with other crystallins, yielding complexes greater than 2&#160;<span class="math">×</span>&#160;10<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span>. There are 2&#160;<span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-crystallin subunits, <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>A and <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>B, each with a molecular mass of approximately 20&#160;kDa, which form heteromeric complexes containing about 30&#160;subunits. The sequence of the <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-crystallins identifies them as members of the family of small heat-shock proteins. <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-Crystallin complexes bind to partially denatured proteins and prevent them from aggregating. Their primary function in lens fiber cells appears to be to inhibit the complete denaturation and insolubilization of the other crystallins.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="greek--tx-">b</span>,<span class="greek--tx-">c</span>-Crystallins are subdivided into 2&#160;groups, based on molecular mass and isoelectric points. The <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-crystallins, a complex group of oligomers composed of polypeptides, are encoded by 7&#160;genes. These crystallins have molecular masses ranging from 23 to 32&#160;kDa. The individual polypeptides associate with each other, forming dimers and higher-&#173;order complexes in their native state. By gel chromatography, the <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-crystallins can be separated into <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>H (<span class="greek--tx-">b</span>&#160;high-&#173;molecular-mass) and <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>L (<span class="greek--tx-">b</span>&#160;low-&#173;molecular-mass) fractions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="greek--tx-">c</span>-crystallins are the smallest of the crystallins, with a molecular mass in the range of 20&#160;kDa or less. The native <span class="greek--tx-">c</span>-crystallins do not associate with each other or with other proteins and, therefore, have the lowest molecular mass of the crystallin fractions. In humans, the gamma family is encoded by 4&#160;genes. X-ray crystallographic studies have determined the 3-dimensional structure of the <span class="greek--tx-">c</span>-crystallins to high resolution. Fourfold repetition of a core 3-dimensional structural motif suggests that the <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>,<span class="greek--tx-">c</span>-crystallins might have arisen from double duplication and fusion of a gene for a 40-residue polypeptide. The basic structure of the <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-crystallins and <span class="greek--tx-">c</span>-crystallins has been maintained through hundreds of millions of years of vertebrate evolution.</p>

			<p class="h2">Membrane Structural Proteins and Cytoskeletal Proteins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The water-insoluble fraction of lens proteins can be further divided into 2&#160;fractions, 1&#160;soluble and 1&#160;insoluble in 8&#160;M urea. The <span class="italic">urea-&#173;soluble fraction</span> of the young lens contains cytoskeletal proteins that provide the structural framework of the lens cells. Microfilaments and microtubules found in lens cells are similar to those found in other cell types. However, the lens contains 2&#160;types of intermediate filaments that are unusual: one class is made from the protein <span class="italic">vimentin,</span> which is not usually found in epithelial cells; the other class, the <span class="italic">beaded filaments,</span> is composed of the proteins phakinin and filensin, which are specific to the lens. Genetic disruption of the structure of the beaded filaments leads to disruption of the structure of the lens fiber cells and formation of a cataract.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">urea-insoluble fraction</span> of the young lens contains the plasma membranes of the lens fiber cells. Several proteins are associated with these fiber cell plasma membranes. One makes up nearly 50% of the membrane proteins and is known as the <span class="italic">major intrinsic protein</span> (<span class="italic">MIP;</span> also known as <span class="italic">aquaporin&#160;0</span>), a member of a class of proteins called <span class="italic">aqua-&#173;porins.</span> Other members of the aquaporin family are found throughout the body, where they serve predominantly as water channels. MIP first appears in the lens just as the fibers begin to elongate. With age, this protein, which has a molecular mass of 28&#160;kDa, undergoes proteolytic cleavage, forming a protein fragment with a molecular mass of 22&#160;kDa. The relative proportions of these 2&#160;proteins become about equal at 20–30&#160;years of age. Over time, the protein with molecular mass of 22&#160;kDa predominates in the lens nucleus.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Increase of Water-Insoluble Proteins With Age</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As the lens ages, its proteins aggregate to form very large particles. These particles become water-&#173;insoluble and scatter light, increasing the opacity of the lens. Of note, the water-&#173;insoluble protein fraction increases with age, even if the lens remains relatively transparent. Conversion of the water-&#173;soluble proteins into water-&#173;insoluble proteins appears to be a natural process in lens fiber maturation, but it may occur more quickly in cataractous lenses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In cataracts with significant browning of the lens nucleus <span class="italic">(brunescent cataracts),</span> the increase in the amount of water-&#173;insoluble protein correlates well with the degree of opacification. In markedly brunescent cataracts, as much as 90% of the nuclear proteins may be in the insoluble fraction. Associated oxidative changes occur, including protein-to-&#173;protein and protein-to-&#173;glutathione disulfide bond formation. These changes result in decreased levels of the reduced form of glutathione and increased levels of glutathione disulfide (oxidized glutathione) in the cytoplasm of the nuclear fiber cells. It is the general view that glutathione is essential to maintain a reducing environment in the lens cytoplasm. Depletion of the reduced form of glutathione accelerates protein crosslinking, protein aggregation, and light scattering. In addition to the increased formation of disulfide bonds, nuclear proteins are highly crosslinked by nondisulfide bonds. This insoluble protein fraction contains yellow-&#173;to-brown pigments that are found in higher concentration in nuclear cataracts. Increased fluorescence is generated by the nondisulfide crosslinks that form in brunescent nuclear cataracts.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Carbohydrate Metabolism</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goal of lens metabolism is the maintenance of lens transparency. In the lens, energy production largely depends on glucose metabolism. Glucose enters the lens from the aqueous humor both by <span class="italic">simple diffusion</span> and by a mediated transfer process called <span class="italic">facilitated diffusion.</span> Most of the glucose transported into the lens is phosphorylated to glucose-6-&#173;phosphate (G6P) by the enzyme hexokinase. This reaction is 70–100&#160;times slower than that of other enzymes involved in lens glycolysis and is, therefore, rate-&#173;limited in the lens. Once formed, G6P enters 1 of 2&#160;metabolic pathways: anaerobic glycolysis or the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The more active of these 2&#160;pathways is <span class="italic">anaerobic glycolysis,</span> which provides most of the high-&#173;energy phosphate bonds required for lens metabolism. Substrate-&#173;linked phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) occurs at 2&#160;steps along the pathway from glucose metabolism to lactate. The rate-&#173;limiting step in the glycolytic pathway itself is at the level of the enzyme phosphofructokinase, which is regulated through feedback control by metabolic products of the glycolytic pathway. This pathway is much less efficient than aerobic glycolysis, because only 2&#160;net molecules of ATP are produced for each glucose molecule utilized, whereas aerobic glycolysis produces an additional 36&#160;molecules of ATP from each glucose molecule metabolized in the citric acid cycle (oxidative metabolism). Because of the low oxygen tension in the lens, only about 3% of the lens glucose passes through the citric acid cycle (also called the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the Krebs cycle) to produce ATP; however, even this low level of aerobic metabolism produces approximately 25% of the lens ATP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">That the lens is not dependent on oxygen is demonstrated by its ability to sustain normal metabolism in a nitrogen environment. Provided with ample glucose, the anoxic in vitro lens remains completely transparent, has normal levels of ATP, and maintains its ion and amino acid pump activities. However, when deprived of glucose, the lens cannot maintain these functions and becomes hazy after several hours, even in the presence of oxygen.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The less active pathway for utilization of G6P in the lens is the HMP shunt, also known as the <span class="italic">pentose phosphate pathway.</span> While on average, less than 5% of lens glucose is metabolized by this route, the pathway is stimulated in the presence of elevated levels of glucose.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The glucose that is not phosphorylated to G6P enters the <span class="italic">sorbitol pathway,</span> which is yet another pathway for lens glucose metabolism, or it is converted into gluconic acid. Aldose reductase is the key enzyme in this pathway and has been found to play a pivotal role in the development of “sugar” cataracts. In comparison with hexokinase, aldose reductase has a very low affinity for glucose. Less than 4% of lens glucose is normally converted to sorbitol.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As previously noted, the hexokinase reaction is rate-&#173;limited in phosphorylating glucose in the lens and is inhibited by the feedback mechanisms of the products of glycolysis. Therefore, when the amount of glucose increases in the lens (as occurs in hyperglycemic states), the sorbitol pathway is activated relatively more than the glycolytic pathway, and sorbitol accumulates. Sorbitol is metabolized to fructose by the enzyme polyol dehydrogenase. Unfortunately, this enzyme has a relatively low affinity (high <span class="italic">K</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">m</span> [apparent affinity constant]), meaning that considerable sorbitol will accumulate before being further metabolized. This characteristic, combined with the poor permeability of the lens to sorbitol, results in retention of sorbitol in the lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A high ratio of NADPH/NADH drives the reaction in the direction of sorbitol accumulation. The accumulation of NADP that occurs as a consequence of activation of the sorbitol pathway may cause the HMP shunt stimulation that is observed in the presence of an elevated lens glucose level. In addition to sorbitol, fructose levels increase in a lens incubated in a high-&#173;glucose environment. Together, the 2&#160;sugars increase the osmotic pressure within the lens, drawing in water. At first, the energy-&#173;dependent pumps of the lens are able to compensate, but ultimately they are overwhelmed. The result is swelling of the fibers, disruption of the normal cytoskeletal architecture, and opacification of the lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The pivotal role of aldose reductase in cataractogenesis in animals is apparent from studies of cataract development in various hyperglycemic animal species. Those species that have high aldose reductase activities develop lens opacities, whereas those lacking aldose reductase do not. In addition, specific inhibitors of this enzymatic activity, applied either systemically or topically to 1&#160;eye, decrease the rate of onset and the severity of glucose cataracts in experimental studies.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Oxidative Damage and Protective Mechanisms</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Free radicals are generated in the course of normal cellular metabolic activities and may also be produced by external agents such as radiant energy. These free radicals are highly reactive and can damage lens fibers. Peroxidation of lens fiber plasma or plasma membrane lipids has been suggested as a factor contributing to lens opacification.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because oxygen tension in and around the lens is normally low, free radical reactions may not involve molecular oxygen; instead, the free radicals may react directly with molecules. DNA is easily damaged by free radicals. Although some of the damage to the lens is reparable, some of it may be permanent. Free radicals can also attack the proteins or membrane lipids in the lens cortex. No repair mechanisms are known to ameliorate such damage. In lens fibers, where protein synthesis no longer takes place, free radical damage may lead to polymerization and crosslinking of lipids and proteins, resulting in an increase in the water-&#173;insoluble protein content.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The lens is equipped with several enzymes that protect against free radical or oxidative damage, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. <br />Superoxide dismutase catalyzes the destruction of the superoxide anion, O<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">–</span>, and produces hydrogen peroxide, which is broken down by catalase. Next, glutathione peroxidase catalyzes a reaction resulting in the formation of glutathione disulfide (GSSG), which is then reconverted to glutathione (GSH) by glutathione reductase, using the pyridine nucleotide NADPH. The primary source of erythrocyte NADPH, the HMP shunt provides NADPH as the reducing agent. Thus, glutathione acts indirectly as a major free radical scavenger in the lens. In addition, both vitamin&#160;E and ascorbic acid are present in the lens. Each of these substances can act as a free radical scavenger and thus protect against oxidative damage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Increasing oxygen levels within the eye may have a role in cataract formation. For example, exposure of the lens to an increased level of oxygen during long-term hyperbaric oxygen therapy leads to a myopic shift, increased opacification of the lens nucleus, and, in many cases, the formation of nuclear cataracts. The lens is also exposed to increased levels of oxygen acutely during retinal surgery and chronically following vitrectomy. Because vitrectomy is associated with very high rates of nuclear cataract formation, it has been suggested that the low oxygen level existing around the lens protects it from oxidative damage and that loss of the gel structure of the vitreous body increases exposure of the lens to oxygen and the risk of nuclear cataracts.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Lens Physiology</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Throughout life, lens epithelial cells at the equator divide and develop into lens fibers, resulting in continual growth of the lens (see Chapter&#160;2, Figs&#160;2-2 and 2-4). The lens cells with the highest metabolic rate are found in the epithelium and outer cortex. These superficial cells utilize oxygen and glucose for the active transport of electrolytes, carbohydrates, and amino acids into the lens. Because the lens is avascular, the task of maintaining transparency poses several challenges. The older cells, found toward the center of the lens, must be able to communicate with the superficial cells and the environment outside the lens. This communication is accomplished through low-&#173;resistance gap junctions that facilitate the exchange of small molecules from cell to cell. Lens fiber cells also have abundant water channels in their membranes, made from MIP. It is not yet certain whether MIP serves primarily as a water channel, as an adhesion molecule that minimizes the extracellular space between fiber cells, or as both in the lens. Minimizing the extracellular space between fiber cells is important to reduce the scattering of light as it passes through the lens.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Maintenance of Lens Water and Cation Balance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The normal human lens contains approximately 66% water and 33% protein, and this proportion changes very little with aging. The lens cortex is more hydrated than the lens nucleus. About 5% of the lens volume is the water found between the lens fibers in the extracellular spaces. Within the lens, sodium and potassium concentrations are maintained at 20&#160;mM and 120&#160;mM, respectively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Perhaps the most important aspect of lens physiology is the mechanism that controls water and electrolyte balance, which is critical to lens transparency. Because transparency is highly dependent on the structural and macromolecular components of the lens, perturbation of cellular hydration can readily lead to opacification. It is noteworthy that disruption of water and electrolyte balance is not a feature of nuclear cataracts. In cortical cataracts, however, the water content rises significantly.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Lens epithelium: site of active transport</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens is less hydrated and has higher levels of potassium ions (K<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>) and amino acids than the surrounding aqueous and vitreous. Conversely, the lens contains lower levels of sodium ions (Na<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>), chloride ions (Cl<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">–</span>), and water than the surrounding environment. The cation balance between the inside and outside of the lens is the result both of the permeability properties of the lens cell membranes and of the activity of the sodium-&#173;potassium pumps, which reside within the cell membranes of the lens epithelium and each lens fiber. The sodium-&#173;potassium pumps function by pumping sodium ions out while taking potassium ions in. This mechanism depends on the breakdown of ATP and is regulated by the enzyme Na<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-ATPase. Inhibition of Na<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-ATPase leads to loss of cation balance and elevated water content in the lens.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Pump–leak theory</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The combination of active transport and membrane permeability is often referred to <br />as the pump–leak system of the lens (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-3</span>). According to the <span class="italic">pump</span>–<span class="italic">leak theory,</span> potassium and various other molecules, such as amino acids, are actively transported into the lens via the epithelium anteriorly. They then diffuse out with the concentration gradient through the back of the lens, where there are no active-&#173;transport mechanisms. Conversely, sodium flows in through the back of the lens with the concentration gradient and then is actively exchanged for potassium by the epithelium. In support of this theory, an anteroposterior gradient was found for both ions: potassium was concentrated in the anterior lens; sodium, in the posterior lens. Most of the Na<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-ATPase activity is found in the lens epithelium and the superficial cortical fiber cells. The active-&#173;transport mechanisms are lost if the capsule and attached epithelium are removed from the lens but not if the capsule alone is removed by enzymatic degradation with collagenase. These findings support the hypothesis that the epithelium is the primary site for active transport in the lens.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Accommodation and Presbyopia</p>
		    <div id="Chapt3_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Accommodation, the mechanism by which the eye changes focus from distant to near images, occurs through a change in lens shape resulting from the action of the ciliary muscle on the zonular fibers. The lens substance is most malleable during childhood and the young-&#173;adult years, progressively losing its ability to change shape with age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">According to the Helmholtz theory of accommodation, most of the accommodative change in lens shape occurs at the central anterior lens surface. The central anterior capsule is thinner than the peripheral capsule (see Chapter&#160;2, Fig&#160;2-3), and the anterior zonular fibers insert slightly closer to the visual axis than do the posterior zonular fibers, resulting in a central anterior bulge with accommodation. The curvature of the posterior lens surface changes minimally with accommodation. The central posterior capsule, which is the thinnest area of the capsule, maintains the same curvature regardless of zonular tension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ciliary muscle is a ring-shaped muscle that, on contraction, has the opposite effect from what one intuitively expects of a sphincter. When a sphincter muscle contracts, it usually tightens its grip. However, when the ciliary muscle contracts, the diameter of the muscle ring is reduced, thereby relaxing the tension on the zonular fibers and allowing the lens to become more spherical. Thus, when the ciliary muscle contracts, the axial thickness of the lens increases, the equatorial diameter of the lens decreases, and the dioptric power of the lens increases, resulting in accommodation. When the ciliary muscle relaxes, the zonular tension increases, the lens flattens, and the dioptric power of the eye decreases (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;3-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The accommodative response may be stimulated by the known or apparent size and distance of an object or by blur, chromatic aberration, or a continual oscillation of ciliary tone. Accommodation is mediated by the parasympathetic fibers of cranial nerve III (oculomotor). Parasympathomimetic drugs (eg, pilocarpine) induce accommodation, whereas parasympatholytic medications (eg, atropine) block accommodation. Drugs that relax the ciliary muscle are called <span class="italic">cycloplegics.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">amplitude of accommodation</span> is the amount of change in the eye’s refractive power that is produced by accommodation. It diminishes with age and may be affected by some medications and diseases. Adolescents generally have 12.00–16.00&#160;D of accommodation, whereas adults at age 40&#160;years have 4.00–8.00&#160;D. After age 50&#160;years, accommodation decreases to less than 2.00&#160;D.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Presbyopia</span> is the gradual loss of accommodative response, resulting from reduced elasticity of the crystalline lens. Once an individual is approximately 40&#160;years of age or older, the rigidity of the lens nucleus reduces accommodation, as contraction of the ciliary muscle no longer results in increased convexity and dioptric power of the anterior surface of the lens. This decreased accommodation then becomes clinically significant. Studies have shown that, throughout life, the hardness or stiffness of the human lens increases more than 1000-fold. (See also BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics.</span>) Researchers continue to explore other factors that may contribute to presbyopia, such as changes in lens dimensions, in the elasticity of the lens capsule, and in the geometry of zonular attachments with age.</p>
