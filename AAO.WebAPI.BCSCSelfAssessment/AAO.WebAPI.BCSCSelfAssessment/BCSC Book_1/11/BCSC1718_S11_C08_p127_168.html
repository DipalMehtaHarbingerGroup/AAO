			<p class="chapter-title">Complications of Cataract Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complications of cataract surgery vary in timing as well as scope. Undesirable consequences of surgery may occur intraoperatively or postoperatively. Many large-scale peer-&#173;reviewed studies of cataract surgery complications contain data from large-&#173;incision extracapsular surgery or from procedures performed with earlier phacoemulsification technology. Studies show that the incidence of severe adverse events after cataract surgery, including endophthalmitis, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, and retinal detachment, has declined over the past 2&#160;decades.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fortunately, complications resulting in loss of vision are rare with modern surgical techniques and technology in the hands of experienced cataract surgeons. The most common serious <span class="italic">intraoperative</span> complication of phacoemulsification is posterior capsule rupture (reported in 1.5%–3.5% of cases). Common <span class="italic">postoperative</span> complications include posterior capsule opacification, corneal edema (reported in 0.03%–5.18% of cases), clinically apparent cystoid macular edema (CME) (1.2%–3.5% of cases), and retained lens fragments (0.45%–1.70% of cases). The incidence of retinal detachment in the first postoperative year averages approximately 0.7%; that of endophthalmitis, 0.04%–0.20%; and that of intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation, 0.19%–1.10%.</p>

			<p class="h1">Corneal Complications</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top1">
			<p class="h2-h1">Corneal Edema</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Stromal and/or epithelial edema may occur in the immediate postoperative period. The incidence is higher in eyes with preexisting corneal endothelial dysfunction such as Fuchs dystrophy. Edema is usually caused by a combination of mechanical trauma, prolonged surgery, chemical injury, inflammation, or elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), resulting in acute endothelial decompensation with an increase in corneal thickness (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;8-1</span>). Toxic substances inadvertently introduced into the anterior chamber can cause acute endothelial dysfunction with diffuse corneal edema referred to as <span class="italic">toxic anterior segment syndrome</span> (<span class="italic">TASS;</span> discussed later in this chapter). Late postoperative focal corneal edema may occur because of small nuclear fragments retained in the anterior chamber angle. These fragments may be noticed on initial postoperative examinations, or they may be identified up to years later if they migrate into the anterior chamber from a secluded location in the posterior chamber.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist must thoroughly examine the eye to identify factors that may cause or exacerbate edema. If epithelial edema is present in the face of a compact stroma immediately after surgery, it is likely due to elevated IOP with an intact endothelium. Lowering IOP medically or via aqueous release from the paracentesis site often results in rapid resolution of epithelial edema in these cases. As a rule, if the corneal periphery is clear, the corneal edema will resolve with time. Edema from surgical trauma generally resolves completely within 4–6&#160;weeks of surgery. Corneal edema that persists after 3&#160;months usually does not clear. Significant chronic corneal edema from loss of endothelial cells results in bullous keratopathy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-1</span>), which is associated with reduced vision, ocular irritation, foreign-&#173;body sensation, epiphora, and occasionally infectious keratitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In its early stages, corneal edema after cataract surgery can be managed with topical hyperosmotic agents, corticosteroids, and/or aqueous suppressants, if indicated. A bandage (therapeutic) contact lens may be used, if necessary. Over time, subepithelial scarring may develop, resulting in a decrease in bullae formation and discomfort. Decreased vision, recurrent keratitis, and pain are possible indications for endothelial or penetrating keratoplasty. Endothelial keratoplasty has been very successful in restoring clear corneas and improving vision. Bullae and pain associated with bullous keratopathy may be alleviated with phototherapeutic keratectomy, cautery of Bowman membrane, anterior stromal micropuncture, or corneal crosslinking (not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration). For the eye with little or no visual potential, when comfort is the primary goal, a Gundersen conjunctival flap or an amniotic membrane graft is an option; neither of these carries the greater risks of endothelial or penetrating keratoplasty. (See also BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span>)</p>
			<p class="h3">Brown-McLean syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Brown-McLean syndrome is a clinical condition of unknown etiology that occurs following cataract surgery and is characterized by peripheral corneal edema with a clear central cornea. The condition occurs most frequently following intracapsular cataract surgery, but it has also been reported following extracapsular surgery and phacoemulsification. The edema usually starts inferiorly and progresses circumferentially; the central 5–7-mm zone of the cornea is typically not involved. Central cornea guttae frequently appear, and punctate brown pigment on the endothelium often underlies the edematous areas. In rare cases, Brown-&#173;McLean syndrome progresses to clinically significant central corneal edema.</p>
			<p class="h3">Vitreocorneal adherence and persistent corneal edema</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vitreocorneal touch or adherence may contribute to persistent corneal edema after cataract surgery complicated by vitreous prolapse. Removing all vitreous from the anterior chamber during complicated cataract surgery decreases the risk of corneal edema and retinal detachment. If vitreous prolapse with corneal touch or incarceration in the wound is recognized postoperatively and corneal edema or CME develops, an anterior vitrectomy or Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis may be indicated. In more advanced cases with prolonged corneal edema, penetrating or endothelial keratoplasty combined with vitrectomy may be indicated.</p>
			<p class="h2">Incision and Wound Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Proper incision construction and closure are critical in reducing intraoperative and postoperative complications. Scleral, limbal, or corneal wound strength is only 10% of normal tissue strength at 1&#160;week, increasing to only 40% by 8&#160;weeks and 75%–80% of its original strength by 2&#160;years. There is concern that the increased use of sutureless clear corneal incisions may be responsible for an increased incidence of postoperative wound leakage and subsequent greater risk of endophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Signs of wound leakage include decreased vision, hypotony, corneal striae, shallow anterior chamber, hyphema, choroidal folds, choroidal effusion, macular edema, and optic nerve edema. A Seidel test, ultrasound biomicroscopy, or anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) may help diagnose or confirm subtle cases. Management of wound leaks depends on their etiology, timing, and severity. Small leaks in the early postoperative period may be asymptomatic and self-&#173;limited. Medical treatment may include prophylactic topical antibiotics, cycloplegia, aqueous inhibitors, patching, decreasing or stopping corticosteroid therapy, or a collagen shield or bandage contact lens. In more serious cases with persistent shallowing of the anterior chamber, iris prolapse, prolonged hypotony, choroidal effusion, or macular edema, surgical repair is indicated. Suturing the wound is usually sufficient, but an amniotic membrane graft or tissue adhesives such as cyanoacrylate or hydrogel glue may be used.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A wound leak under a conjunctival flap may lead to an inadvertent filtering bleb. Over time, the fistula may epithelialize, become resistant to medical management, and require surgical intervention. Efforts to promote wound healing and cicatrization of the bleb include cryotherapy, diathermy, chemical cauterization with trichloroacetic acid, or injection of an autologous blood patch. In chronic cases, it may be necessary to excise the bleb/conjunctiva and search for a fistula, which should be scraped free of invading epithelium or excised and covered, if necessary, with a scleral patch graft followed by resuturing of the wound. Tenon capsule and conjunctiva should be used to cover the exposed sclera.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Thermal wound burns</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Thermal injury to the incision may result in whitening of the corneal tissue, contraction, and wound gape. During phacoemulsification, heat may be transferred from the needle to the cornea because of inadequate cooling of the phaco tip. This can result from an insufficient inflow of coaxial irrigation fluid or from occlusion of outflow at the phaco tip or aspiration line by an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) or lens material. This complication is more common with dispersive OVD and increased lens density. Bimanual small-&#173;incision surgery raises the risk, as the phaco needle is in direct contact with the cornea without an irrigating jacket.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Friction produces heat and thereby causes the corneal collagen to contract at a temperature of 60°C or higher, subsequently distorting the incision. If the distortion is significant, wound gape may occur with associated leakage. These incisions are not usually self-&#173;sealing, and they require suturing, a sliding scleral flap, or patch grafts for adequate closure.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Wound dehiscence or rupture</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Postoperative wound dehiscence may be spontaneous or secondary to trauma. The severity depends on the size and integrity of the wound and the degree of healing, which may be affected by the use of corticosteroids or the presence of systemic disease that alters collagen metabolism. The trend toward smaller incisions has decreased the occurrence of wound dehiscence. Traumatic wound rupture is often accompanied by extrusion of intraocular contents and almost always requires surgical repair.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Descemet Membrane Detachment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Descemet membrane detachment results in stromal swelling and epithelial bullae localized in the area of detachment. This complication can occur when an instrument or IOL is introduced through the incision or when fluid or an OVD is inadvertently injected between the Descemet membrane and the corneal stroma. Small detachments may resolve spontaneously. Otherwise, they may be reattached with air or an expansile gas (eg, sulfur hexafluoride [SF<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span>] or perfluoropropane [C<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>F<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">8</span>]) tamponade in the anterior chamber. Larger detachments can be sutured back into place under gas or an OVD. These cases should be referred to a surgeon familiar with these techniques.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Induced Astigmatism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Localized change in corneal curvature may result from corneal burns produced by the phaco tip or, more commonly, from surgical incisions. Most well-&#173;constructed peripheral corneal, limbal, or scleral incisions less than 3&#160;mm in length will induce less than 1.00&#160;D of astigmatism, usually flattening in the axis of the incision. Larger incisions closer to the corneal apex or those that require suture closure are more likely to induce astigmatism. Tight radial sutures may cause steepened corneal curvature in the axis of the suture. The astigmatism induced by larger sutured incisions, such as those used in intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE), extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), or secondary IOL implantation, may decrease by several diopters over time as the sutures dissolve or relax, making suture removal unnecessary. If removal is needed to modulate astigmatism, it is preferable to wait 6–8&#160;weeks postoperatively. Sutures may be cut at the slit lamp with a blade or lysed by an argon or diode laser. If more than 1&#160;suture is to be removed, it is preferable to cut adjacent sutures in a series of visits rather than all at once. Removal of too many sutures too early in the postoperative period may result in either significant corneal flattening in the axis of the incision or wound dehiscence.</p>
			<p class="h2">Corneal Melting</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Keratolysis, or sterile melting of the cornea, may occur following cataract extraction. It is most frequently associated with preexisting tear film abnormalities resulting from keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), Sjögren syndrome, or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Keratitis may be exacerbated by the chemical or mechanical stress of surgery or the topical medications used perioperatively. The frequent perioperative use of nonpreserved topical lubricants, punctal plug placement, or lateral tarsorrhaphy performed at the time of surgery may be considered to lessen the morbidity in eyes with preexisting tear film abnormalities.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Stromal melting has been reported with the postoperative use of topical diclofenac and other nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The melting may be due in part to the epithelial toxicity and hypoesthesia that these drugs can induce. Stromal melting is more likely to occur in patients with KCS, systemic autoimmune disease, or collagen vascular disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Persistent epithelial defects accompanied by stromal dissolution require intensive treatment with nonpreserved topical lubricants. Use of topical medications, particularly preserved medications, should be minimized to reduce their toxic effect on the corneal epithelium. Additional treatment modalities to encourage epithelialization and to arrest stromal melting include punctal occlusion, bandage contact lenses, tarsorrhaphy, autologous serum eyedrops, collagenase inhibitors such as acetylcysteine 10% or hydroxyprogesterone 1%, and systemic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors such as doxycycline. The prophylactic use of topical antibiotics must be monitored closely. After a week’s application, many topical antibiotics begin to cause secondary toxic effects that may inhibit epithelial healing. If the disease continues to progress despite medical therapy, an amniotic membrane graft or lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty should be considered. Corneal melting may recur even with grafted tissue. For the treatment of any underlying autoimmune disease, systemic immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Other Anterior Segment Complications</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Epithelial or Fibrous Ingrowth</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Epithelial ingrowth</span> (or <span class="italic">downgrowth</span>) is a rare complication of intraocular surgery. This condition is characterized by the growth of epithelium intraocularly following trauma or a surgical incision and by proliferation over the corneal endothelium, trabecular meshwork, and/or iris surfaces. Epithelial cells introduced into the anterior chamber during surgery may adhere to intraocular structures and proliferate as a cellular mass or membrane. Alternatively, a sheet of epithelium from the ocular surface may grow through a wound or incision. Signs of epithelial ingrowth include elevated IOP, clumps of cells floating in the anterior chamber, a grayish retrocorneal membrane (usually with overlying corneal edema), an abnormal iris surface, and pupillary distortion. The elevated IOP may be due to outflow obstruction caused by growth of the epithelial membrane over the trabecular meshwork or by epithelial cells clogging the meshwork. Argon laser burns applied to the membrane on the iris surface will appear white if epithelial cells are present, which helps confirm the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Fibrous ingrowth</span> is more prevalent than epithelial ingrowth. Fibrovascular tissue, rather than epithelial cells alone, proliferates from a penetrating wound. Fibrous ingrowth progresses more slowly than epithelial ingrowth and may be self-&#173;limited. It is a common cause of corneal graft failure and may result in formation of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) and secondary angle-&#173;closure glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Risk factors for both epithelial and fibrous ingrowth include trauma, prolonged inflammation, wound dehiscence, delayed wound closure, vitreous incarceration, and Descemet membrane tears. No treatment for these conditions has been found to be uniformly successful. Many surgical procedures, including membrane excision and fistula repair, have been suggested. Local application of cryotherapy or of 5-fluorouracil has been reported to be effective. Medical therapy for secondary glaucoma may be indicated. However, the IOP is often difficult to control, and filtering procedures or tube shunt implantation may be necessary.</p>
			<p class="h2">Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) is an acute sterile postoperative inflammation. The symptoms and signs of TASS may mimic those of infectious endophthalmitis and include photophobia, severe reduction in visual acuity, corneal edema, and marked anterior chamber reaction, occasionally with hypopyon. TASS presents within hours of surgery, whereas acute infectious endophthalmitis typically develops 2–7&#160;days postoperatively. Other potentially distinguishing features of TASS include diffuse, limbus-to-&#173;limbus corneal edema; anterior chamber fibrinous exudate; a dilated, irregular, or nonreactive pupil; and elevated IOP. The pathologic changes are limited to the anterior chamber. Pain is typically much milder than that experienced with an infection. If endophthalmitis is suspected, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (described later in this chapter)&#160;should be undertaken. Treatment of TASS consists of use of intensive topical corticosteroids until the inflammation subsides. A brief course of systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial. Frequent follow-&#173;up is necessary to monitor IOP and to reassess for signs of bacterial infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">TASS is thought to be caused by the inadvertent introduction of a substance toxic to the corneal endothelium or uvea. Subconjunctival antibiotic injections and topical ophthalmic ointments applied with patching have been reported to enter the anterior chamber through corneoscleral incisions. Skin cleansers containing chlorhexidine gluconate have been reported to cause irreversible corneal edema and opacification if they come into contact with the endothelium. Clusters of TASS due to irrigation fluids tainted with bacterial endotoxin have been reported. Other possible causes of TASS include improperly cleaned surgical instruments; surgical glove residue or talc on instruments or IOLs; use of a denatured OVD; substitution of sterile water for balanced salt solution; or the intraocular use of inappropriate irrigating solutions, antibiotics, or anesthetics. All solutions used intracamerally should ideally be free of stabilizers and preservatives and buffered to physiologic osmolarity and pH. The risk of TASS is higher with reusable irrigation/<br />aspiration (I/A) handpieces, cannulas, or irrigation tubing, as residue of detergents, enzymatic cleaners, or OVD may be present. The risk of TASS can be reduced by careful cleaning, rinsing, and air-&#173;drying of reusable cannulas; by use of disposable instrumentation; and by avoiding the intraocular use of any nonphysiologic or preserved solutions.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Shallow or Flat Anterior Chamber</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Intraoperative</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">During ECCE or phacoemulsification, the anterior chamber may become shallow because of inadequate infusion, leakage through an oversized incision, external pressure on the globe, “positive vitreous pressure,” fluid misdirection syndrome, suprachoroidal effusion, or suprachoroidal hemorrhage. If the reason for loss of normal chamber depth is not apparent, the surgeon should first reduce aspiration, raise the infusion bottle height, and check the incision. If the incision is too large, the surgeon may partially suture it in order to keep the chamber formed. External pressure on the globe can be relieved by readjusting the surgical drapes or the eyelid speculum. “Positive vitreous pressure,” or forward displacement of the lens–iris diaphragm, occurs more commonly in obese or thick-necked patients, in patients with pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and in patients experiencing a level of anxiety or discomfort that may lead them to squeeze their eyelids or perform a Valsalva maneuver. Placing obese patients in a reverse Trendelenburg position may be useful. Intravenous mannitol can be used to reduce the vitreous volume and deepen the anterior chamber in selected cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the reason for the loss of anterior chamber depth or elevated IOP is unknown, the surgeon should check the red reflex to evaluate the possibility of a suprachoroidal hemorrhage or effusion. In these situations, the eye typically becomes very firm, and the patient becomes agitated and reports having pain. To confirm this diagnosis, the surgeon should examine the fundus with an indirect ophthalmoscope or fundus lens. If the hemorrhage or effusion is significant, the incisions should be closed and the operation postponed until the pressure has decreased. (See the section Suprachoroidal Effusion or Hemorrhage, later in this chapter, and BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text">During phacoemulsification or irrigation/aspiration, the anterior chamber may become shallow and the lens or posterior capsule may bulge anteriorly because of <span class="italic">posterior fluid misdirection syndrome.</span> Irrigation fluid infused into the anterior chamber may be misdirected into the vitreous cavity through intact zonular fibers or through a zonular or capsular tear, causing an increase in the vitreous volume with subsequent forward displacement of the lens and shallowing of the anterior chamber. The fluid may accumulate in the retrolental space or dissect posteriorly along the vitreoretinal interface. If gentle posterior pressure on the lens or reinflation of the capsular bag with OVD does not alleviate the situation, intravenous mannitol infusion and waiting at least 20&#160;minutes may allow the anterior chamber to deepen. If suprachoroidal effusion or hemorrhage has been ruled out, the surgeon can insert a 20- to 23-gauge needle through the pars plana into the vitreous by direct visualization, gently aspirate fluid vitreous, and deepen the anterior chamber with irrigation fluid or OVD. Alternatively, vitreous aspiration may be performed with a cutting/aspirating pars plana vitrectomy tip inserted through a sclerotomy 3.5&#160;mm behind the limbus, combined with infusion of balanced salt solution or injection of additional OVD into the anterior chamber.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Postoperative</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A flat anterior chamber during the postoperative period may cause permanent damage to ocular structures. Prolonged apposition of the iris to angle structures can result in PAS formation and chronic angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. Following either ICCE or ECCE, iridovitreal or iridocapsular synechiae can also lead to pupillary block. Corneal contact with vitreous or an IOL can result in endothelial cell loss and chronic corneal edema.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Postoperative shallow or flat anterior chambers can be classified according to their etiology and level of IOP. Causes include a leaking incision, choroidal detachment, pupillary block, ciliary block, capsular block, and suprachoroidal hemorrhage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cases associated with ocular hypotension (IOP below 10&#160;mm&#160;Hg) are usually secondary to leakage of aqueous at the incision site or to choroidal or ciliary body detachment. Patients may be asymptomatic, especially if a leaking incision is plugged by iris incarceration, allowing re-formation of the anterior chamber. Even without iris incarceration, slow or intermittent leaks may coexist with a formed anterior chamber. Carefully comparing the chamber depth of the surgical eye with that of the fellow eye may help the surgeon identify these cases. (For a discussion of evaluation and management of an incisional leak, see the section Incision and Wound Complications, earlier in this chapter.)</p>
			<p class="body-text">In cases of prolonged hypotony, an associated ciliochoroidal detachment may develop that can resolve spontaneously after incision closure. Surgical exploration with re-formation of the anterior chamber and repair of the incision is indicated if no improvement occurs within 24–48&#160;hours, if obvious wound gape is present, if the iris is prolapsed out of the incision, or if intraocular structures such as the IOL are in contact with the corneal endothelium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Late hypotony without obvious leakage from the incision is uncommon after cataract surgery. It may result from retinal detachment, cyclodialysis, filtering bleb formation, or persistent uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cases of a shallow anterior chamber with normal or high IOP are usually the result of pupillary block, ciliary block, capsular block, or suprachoroidal hemorrhage. Pupillary block that occurs in the early postoperative period may follow a resolved incision leak. Postoperative uveitis with iridovitreal or iridocapsular synechiae may cause relatively late pupillary block. Failure to perform a peripheral iridectomy after placement of an anterior chamber IOL (ACIOL) may also be associated with early or late postoperative pupillary block. If initial attempts at pupillary dilation fail to deepen the anterior chamber and lower the pressure, a laser peripheral iridotomy is usually effective. Ciliary block glaucoma, capsular block, and suprachoroidal hemorrhage are discussed later in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Elevated Intraocular Pressure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A mild, self-limited rise in IOP is common following cataract surgery. However, a significant and sustained elevation may require timely management.</p>
			<p class="body-text">OVD retained in the eye after cataract surgery is frequently responsible for early postoperative IOP elevation, which peaks 4–6&#160;hours after surgery. The large molecules of the viscoelastic material can impair aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. Even when all apparent OVD is removed from the anterior chamber, residual OVD, particularly dispersive agents, can lodge in the posterior chamber or behind the lens implant. All types of OVDs, but in particular the higher-&#173;viscosity agents, may cause the pressure to rise. IOP elevation usually does not last more than a few days and is amenable to medical treatment. The clinician may quickly manage marked IOP elevation in the early postoperative period by applying gentle pressure on the posterior lip of a preexisting paracentesis incision to release a small amount of aqueous humor. Topical and/or systemic pressure-&#173;lowering agents should also be administered, as IOP reduction after aqueous release is short-lived, with the IOP likely to rise again within 1–2&#160;hours of the decompression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Elevated IOP without angle closure after cataract surgery may be caused by hyphema, TASS, endophthalmitis, retained lens material (phacolytic or phacoanaphylactic reactions), uveitis, iris pigment release, preexisting glaucoma, corticosteroid use, vitreous in the anterior chamber, ghost cell glaucoma, or <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-chymotrypsin use. Angle-&#173;closure glaucoma may be due to pupillary block, ciliary block, epithelial ingrowth, neovascular glaucoma, or PAS. Treating the underlying cause of the IOP elevation should be curative.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) is the intraoperative triad of iris billowing and floppiness, iris prolapse into the incisions, and progressive pupillary miosis. Studies have shown that IFIS, especially when unexpected, results in a higher rate of surgical complications, including iris trauma, posterior capsule rupture, and vitreous loss. IFIS was originally associated with either the current or prior use of tamsulosin, a selective <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1a</span>-adrenergic antagonist. Since then, IFIS has been reported with the use of other selective and nonselective <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-adrenergic antagonists, such as doxazosin, terazosin, alfuzosin, and silodosin. It may also occur following the use of some antipsychotic agents, such as chlorpromazine, or other drugs and supplements with <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-adrenergic antagonist activity (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;8-2</span>). Drugs that are selective <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1a</span>-adrenergic antagonists seem to have a greater effect on the iris dilator muscle than do nonselective drugs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tamsulosin is most commonly used to treat lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hypertrophy. It is also used to treat patients with renal stones and occasionally to treat women with urinary retention. Doxazosin, terazosin, prazosin, and labetalol (which is both an <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-adrenergic antagonist and a <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonist) are used to treat hypertension. IFIS may occur in patients who have had no apparent exposure to <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-adrenergic antagonists, and it has been reported more commonly in patients with hypertension but not diabetes mellitus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">IFIS may be mild, moderate, or severe. Patients taking tamsulosin experience these degrees of severity in approximately equal numbers. There is no correlation with adrenergic antagonist dosage or duration of therapy, and discontinuing the medication preoperatively seems to have no effect on the degree of IFIS.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All preoperative patients should be questioned about their use of <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-adrenergic antagonists. Since 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required that these medications be labeled with a precautionary statement about IFIS and cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following interventions have been proposed to reduce the intraoperative effects of IFIS:</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many surgeons employ intracameral irrigation with 0.5–1.0&#160;mL of buffered, preservative-&#173;free lidocaine 0.75% mixed with preservative-&#173;free epinephrine 1:4000 or phenylephrine 1.5%. Because these solutions must be compounded, there is a risk of mixing errors and subsequent TASS. Additive-&#173;free epinephrine is currently not available in the United States, but epinephrine stabilized with bisulfite has been used successfully when diluted in a ratio of at least 1:4 with balanced salt solution. A commercial solution of unpreserved ketorolac and phenylephrine used as an additive to the irrigation solution is now available in the United States. Despite these interventions, significant miosis and/or iris prolapse still occurs intraoperatively in some patients.</p>

			<p class="h2">Lens–Iris Diaphragm Retropulsion Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lens–iris diaphragm retropulsion syndrome (LIDRS) during cataract extraction is characterized by posterior displacement of the lens–iris diaphragm with a marked deepening of the anterior chamber, posterior iris bowing, and pupil dilation. It is more common in highly myopic eyes and in eyes that have undergone previous vitrectomy. LIDRS is due to a high level of infusion pressure in the anterior chamber with a reverse pupillary block and may cause stress on the zonular apparatus and considerable patient discomfort under topical anesthesia. Also, because of the excessively deep anterior chamber, surgery may be more difficult. Lifting the iris off the anterior capsule is usually sufficient to break the pupillary block and restore normal anterior chamber depth.</p>

			<p class="h2">Iridodialysis and Iris Trauma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Iridodialysis, the tearing of the iris at its root or insertion, may occur at the time of insertion of the phaco tip or IOL if iris tissue is engaged. Traction on the iris root due to aspir&#173;ation of iris tissue during phacoemulsification can cause a tear and subsequent hyphema. If the iridodialysis is small or insignificant, it can be left alone. More extensive iridodialysis that could cause optical problems or that could be cosmetically significant may require surgical reattachment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chronic mydriasis or iris damage from surgery or trauma may cause excessive glare, particularly if the pupillary light response is inadequate or if the edge of the IOL is not covered. Suturing an iris defect, performing pupillary cerclage, or implanting artificial iris devices may alleviate symptoms or address a patient’s cosmetic concerns. An iris-&#173;colored contact lens may be considered as a nonsurgical alternative.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cyclodialysis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cyclodialysis, the separation of the ciliary body from its insertion at the scleral spur, may occur as a result of trauma or surgical manipulation of intraocular tissue. Gonioscopic observation shows a deep-&#173;angle recess with a gap between the sclera and the ciliary body. Repair of a cyclodialysis cleft is often indicated if hypotony results. Closure may be achieved with argon laser photocoagulation at the site of cyclodialysis. If this is ineffective, it may be necessary to reattach the ciliary body with sutures.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Ciliary Block Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ciliary block glaucoma (also known as <span class="italic">malignant glaucoma, aqueous misdirection,</span> or <span class="italic">vitreous block</span>) was classically thought to be caused by anterior rotation of the ciliary body and posterior misdirection of aqueous into the vitreous body. More recently, the condition has been described as a ciliolenticular block induced by anterior movement of the lens–iris diaphragm, poor vitreous fluid conductivity, and choroidal expansion. These factors cause the central and peripheral portions of the anterior chamber to become very shallow and lead to a secondary elevation of IOP as a consequence of angle obstruction. Ciliary block glaucoma occurs most commonly after intraocular surgery in eyes with prior angle-&#173;closure glaucoma, but it can also occur in small eyes with open angles. It must be differentiated from pupillary block glaucoma, capsular block, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, and choroidal detachment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">IOP may be elevated despite the presence of a patent iridectomy or iridotomy. Thus, ciliary block glaucoma, unlike pupillary block, is not relieved by iridectomy but requires either intense medical therapy or more aggressive surgical therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Medical treatment consists of cycloplegia with atropine and aggressive aqueous suppression with <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists, <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-adrenergic agonists, and/or oral or topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, as well as hyperosmotic agents (such as oral glycerin or intravenous mannitol). Miotics should be avoided because they can make ciliary block glaucoma worse by exacerbating the anterior displacement of the lens–iris diaphragm. Medical therapy may be successful in 50% of these cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgical intervention consists of Nd:YAG laser iridozonulohyaloidotomy and, occasionally, vitrectomy to disrupt the anterior vitreous face and vitreous–ciliary body interface so as to establish, in effect, a unicameral eye with an open channel for aqueous to circulate into the anterior chamber. (See also BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma.</span>)</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Postoperative Uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Following cataract extraction, nearly all eyes exhibit some degree of intraocular inflammation. With uncomplicated cataract surgery and the use of postoperative topical corticosteroids and/or NSAIDs, most eyes should be free of inflammation by 3–4&#160;weeks postoperatively. Complicated cases requiring manipulation of intraocular tissues (eg, iris sphincterotomy, iridectomy, or repair), involving vitreous loss or prolapse, or requiring sulcus fixation of an IOL may have a more prolonged recovery. Increased inflammation may also be seen in children; in patients with diabetes mellitus; in patients who have had previous surgery, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or pigment dispersion syndrome; and with long-term miotic use.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Low-grade inflammation lasting more than 4&#160;weeks raises the possibility of chronic infection, retained lens fragments, or other causes of chronic inflammation. IOL malposition is an important cause of chronic inflammation if the lens comes in contact with the iris, ciliary body, or angle structures. An IOL designed for capsular bag placement may cause inflammation if placed in the ciliary sulcus. Retained lens material may be an insidious cause of chronic low-grade inflammation or corneal edema (see the following section). The presence of hypopyon or vitritis should prompt intervention to determine the source of the inflammation and to rule out an infectious etiology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgeon should also investigate the possibility of microbial endophthalmitis in patients who have persistent uveitis without a previous history of inflammation. Chronic uveitis following cataract surgery has been reported in association with low-grade infections with bacterial pathogens, including <span class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes</span> and <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis.</span> Such patients may have an unremarkable early postoperative course and lack the classic findings of acute endophthalmitis. Weeks or months after surgery, however, they develop chronic uveitis that is variably responsive to topical corticosteroids. This condition is usually associated with granulomatous keratic precipitates and, less commonly, with hypopyon. A localized focus of infection sequestered within the capsular bag may occasionally be observed. Diagnosis requires a high level of clinical suspicion, coupled with examination and cultures of appropriate specimens of aqueous, vitreous, and (where applicable) retained lens material that may harbor a nidus of infection. Appropriate intravitreal antibiotic therapy is indicated. If this treatment fails, the clinician may need to search for and remove any visible focus of infection in order to sterilize the eye. In some cases, total removal of the residual capsule and IOL is necessary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with preexisting uveitis may have excessive postoperative inflammation but generally do well with small-&#173;incision cataract surgery with IOL implantation in the capsular bag. Some surgeons prefer acrylic IOL material over silicone in patients with preexisting uveitis or a risk of chronic inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Management of chronic uveitis is directed toward the cause. Surgery is used for correction of mechanical issues with IOL malposition, vitreous incarceration, or retained lens fragments. If no obvious etiology can be found, prolonged use of topical or subconjunctival corticosteroids is indicated, with continued efforts to identify a cause.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Retained Lens Material</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">During cataract extraction, lens material may remain in the anterior chamber angle or in the posterior chamber behind the iris, or it may migrate into the vitreous cavity if zonular dehiscence or posterior capsule rupture occurs. Retained lens material in the aqueous chamber is thought to occur more frequently with phacoemulsification than with ECCE; the reported postoperative prevalence is 0.45%–1.70%, but the actual rates may be higher because of unrecognized cases. Intraocular turbulence during phacoemulsification may force small lens fragments to lodge in the angle or behind the iris, out of sight of the surgeon. Dispersive OVD may trap and retain more lens fragments than cohesive OVD. Retained lens material may be seen in the inferior anterior chamber during the first postoperative slit-lamp examination, or it may emerge months or even years later from a hidden position in the posterior chamber.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with retained lens material present with varying degrees of inflammation, depending on the size of the lens fragment, the type of lens material, the amount of time elapsed since surgery, and the patient’s individual response. The clinical signs of retained lens material may include uveitis, elevated IOP, corneal edema, and vitreous opacities.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retained cortical lens material or capsular fragments do not necessarily require surgical intervention. In general, cortical material is better tolerated and more likely to reabsorb over time than is nuclear material, which, even in small amounts, persists longer and is more likely to incite a significant inflammatory reaction, corneal edema, or elevated IOP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Inflammation should be controlled with corticosteroid and nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drops. Elevated IOP can be treated with hypotensive drops or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Surgical intervention may be necessary to remove residual lens material in the following situations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-14">presence of a large or visually significant amount of lens material</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">increased inflammation not readily controlled with topical medications</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">medically unresponsive elevated IOP resulting from inflammation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">corneal edema</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">associated retinal detachment or retinal tears</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-15">associated endophthalmitis</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For retained lens fragments in the anterior chamber with an intact posterior capsule, simple I/A or viscoexpression of the residual material may be performed through the original phacoemulsification incision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The reported incidence of intravitreal retained lens fragments is between 0.1% and 1.6%. If lens material has migrated into the vitreous cavity through a defect in the zonular fibers or posterior capsule, referral to a vitreoretinal surgeon for pars plana vitrectomy and removal of the lens material is indicated. The vitreoretinal surgeon can delay intervention for more than a week after the cataract surgery, if necessary, without jeopardizing the successful outcome. A meta-&#173;analysis of vitrectomy for retained posterior lens fragments found that surgery performed within 1–2&#160;weeks resulted in better vision and a lower likelihood of retinal detachment, glaucoma, and chronic inflammation in comparison to delayed surgery.</p>

			<p class="h2">Capsular Rupture</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If posterior capsule rupture occurs during surgery, lens material may enter the posterior chamber. The surgeon should reduce fluid inflow and stabilize the anterior segment. Evaluation of the location and size of the tear will determine the appropriate response. A small rupture in the posterior capsule during emulsification of the nucleus can be managed by alteration of the surgical technique. The surgeon can compartmentalize the vitreous with OVD and use low-flow, low-&#173;vacuum settings to remove the remaining nuclear and cortical material. Full occlusion of the aspiration port and minimal phaco power reduce the risk of aspiration of vitreous or further damage to the capsule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If a small rent appears in the posterior capsule during aspiration of the cortex and the vitreous face remains intact, the surgeon should attempt to remove the residual cortex without expanding the tear. Using low-flow I/A helps avoid disruption of the vitreous face. Some surgeons prefer a manual dry-&#173;aspiration technique. This approach involves using a cannula attached to a handheld syringe to remove the residual cortex after a capsular rupture, thereby avoiding any pressure from irrigation. After the anterior chamber is stabilized with the use of an OVD, capsulorrhexis forceps may be employed to convert the tear in the posterior capsule into a round posterior capsulorrhexis that will resist extending equatorially.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If most of the nucleus remains and the capsular tear is large, further attempts at phacoemulsification should be abandoned. To extract the remaining nuclear fragments mechanically, the surgeon should enlarge the incision and remove the nucleus with a lens loop or spoon in a manner that minimizes vitreous traction and further damage to the capsule. Insertion of a second instrument or lens glide behind the nuclear remnant may help prevent the remnant from being dislocated into the vitreous. Alternatively, OVD can be introduced posterior to the fragment in an effort to float it anteriorly, or the nucleus can be elevated into the anterior chamber with an instrument or nuclear spear. Retrieval of nuclear fragments from the deep vitreous is not recommended.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If vitreous prolapse occurs, it is best to remove all vitreous from the anterior chamber during the initial surgery. Doing so will facilitate the removal of residual cortex and the subsequent placement of an IOL. In addition, a vitrectomy can reduce the chance of vitreoretinal traction or vitreous adherence to the IOL, the iris, or the incision. Vitreous loss during cataract surgery is associated with an increased risk of retinal detachment, CME, and endophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The vitreous may be stained with unpreserved or washed triamcinolone for better visualization. The surgeon should avoid manually externalizing and cutting vitreous through the incision. A coaxial anterior vitrectomy can be performed through the main incision site, but it may be preferable to perform a 2-port anterior vitrectomy with separate infusion and aspirating/cutting instruments inserted through new, properly sized limbal incisions. Alternatively, the aspiration/cutting instrument may be placed through a pars plana incision while irrigation is continued through the limbus or cornea. This directs flow posteriorly and reduces the amount of vitreous that migrates into the anterior segment, thereby decreasing vitreoretinal traction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If posterior capsule support for intracapsular placement of the IOL is inadequate, the surgeon should attempt to preserve the anterior capsule and capsulorrhexis to enable capture of the IOL optic in the capsular bag with the haptics placed in the ciliary sulcus. A 3-piece IOL with a total diameter greater than 12.5&#160;mm may be inserted into the ciliary sulcus with or without optic capture. A single-&#173;piece acrylic IOL is not suitable for the ciliary sulcus because of the possible development of uveitis-&#173;glaucoma-hyphema (UGH) syndrome. If capsular integrity is insufficient, the surgeon may substitute an anterior chamber lens. A posterior chamber IOL (PCIOL) may also be used in the absence of capsular support by suturing the haptics to the iris or by fixation of the haptics to the sclera through the ciliary sulcus. If significant lens material remains in the posterior chamber, it should be approached within 1–2&#160;weeks via a pars plana vitrectomy performed by a vitreoretinal surgeon.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Steps for managing posteriorly dislocated lens fragments include the following:</p>

				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-16">Maintain a normotensive globe and prevent anterior chamber collapse.</li>

				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Using either a biaxial limbal or pars plana approach, perform an anterior vitrectomy until no vitreous is seen anterior to the capsule.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Insert an IOL only when safe and indicated—preferably a posterior chamber lens placed in the ciliary sulcus or fixated to iris or sclera, or an anterior chamber lens with prophylactic peripheral iridotomy.</li>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-20">Vitreous Prolapse in the Anterior Chamber</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In cases with vitreous prolapse, the surgeon should attempt to remove all of the vitreous in the anterior chamber to reduce the likelihood of long-term complications. Vitreous in the anterior chamber may lead to chronic intraocular inflammation, corneal edema, glaucoma, and CME. The pupil may be distorted by vitreous adherent to the incision. Inflammation, symptoms of glare due to an exposed IOL edge, and patient dissatisfaction with the appearance of the iris may prompt intervention. In symptomatic patients, Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis or anterior vitrectomy may be considered if the response to topical anti-&#173;inflammatory therapy is inadequate. If the vitreous extends through the incision to the ocular surface, a vitrectomy should be performed. The exposed vitreous may act as a wick, enabling bacteria to enter the eye and increasing the risk of endophthalmitis. In cases of suspected corneal compromise, a posterior vitrectomy approach may be preferable to an anterior approach to reduce the surgical trauma to the cornea.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-21">Complications of IOL Implantation</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Decentration and Dislocation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The reported incidence of symptomatic subluxation or dislocation of an IOL after uncomplicated cataract surgery is 0.19%–3.00%. The dislocated IOL may be either inside the capsule (intracapsular) or outside it (extracapsular) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-2</span>). The most common cause of intracapsular IOL dislocation is zonular degradation associated with pseudoexfoliation syndrome. Insufficient zonular support may also be associated with trauma, previous vitreoretinal surgery, capsular contraction, retinitis pigmentosa, high myopia, uveitis, or congenital conditions that affect zonular integrity. Asymmetric bag/sulcus haptic positions (ie, 1&#160;haptic in the capsular bag and 1 in the sulcus) aggravated by capsular fibrosis and contraction may tilt or decenter an IOL. The most common cause of extracapsular IOL dislocation is sulcus placement of an inadequately sized IOL. Extracapsular dislocation may also occur in the setting of a decentered or oversized capsulorrhexis, localized zonular defects, capsular defects, or IOL haptic damage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Decentration can cause unwanted glare and reflections or multiple images if the edge of the lens is within the pupillary space. If an aspheric, multifocal, or accommodating lens is decentered, the lens’s desired effect is diminished. Decentration of an aspheric lens with negative spherical aberration (used to counteract the positive spherical aberration of the aging cornea) results in greater higher orders of aberration compared with a decentered spherical lens. Decentration of any PCIOL may lead to pupillary capture or any component of UGH syndrome due to contact with uveal tissue. Minor decentration may be treated with miotics to constrict the pupil over the IOL optic or with cycloplegics to reduce iris chafing by the IOL optic or haptics in cases of pigment dispersion or recurrent hyphema. Laser pupilloplasty may be used to realign the pupillary aperture with the IOL optical center. This procedure may be particularly useful with multifocal lenses. More-&#173;severe cases of IOL decentration are managed with IOL repositioning, stabilization with sutures, or exchange.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An IOL designed for intracapsular fixation is prone to decentration or dislocation when 1 or both haptics are placed in the sulcus. Occasionally, a lens decentered in the sulcus or in the capsular bag with a posterior capsule rent may be stabilized by prolapsing the optic through an intact capsulorrhexis. An extracapsular decentered IOL may be rotated and repositioned into a stable axis if there is sufficient support. Many extracapsular and selected intracapsular 3-piece IOL dislocations can be managed with peripheral iris suture fixation using a McCannel suture or Siepser slipknot technique with a nonabsorbable monofilament suture, such as 9-0 or 10-0&#160;polypropylene (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-3</span>). Iris fixation has some advantages over scleral fixation, including a decreased risk of late suture erosion or breakage, IOL tilting, intraocular hemorrhage, and endophthalmitis. Disadvantages include possible posterior iris pigment chafing, pupil distortion, pseudophakodonesis, and hyphema. Current 1-piece uniplanar acrylic IOLs are not suitable for sulcus or iris fixation because of possible development of UGH syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Irregular capsular fibrosis may gradually decenter an IOL placed in the capsular bag. Deformation of the haptics may render simple rotation insufficient to center the IOL properly. In such cases, it may become necessary to move the IOL haptics into the ciliary sulcus or replace the lens. Haptics fixated in the capsular bag or sulcus can be either amputated and left in place or slipped out of a fibrous cocoon when removing the optic prior to implanting a new IOL.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Severe pseudophakodonesis or intracapsular (in-the-bag) dislocation of an IOL due to zonular loss may be managed with haptic fixation to the sclera. Many different ab externo and ab interno approaches and suture configurations have been described (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-4</span>). A concurrent anterior vitrectomy is often necessary. Iris retractors may be used for better visualization or to stabilize the haptics during suturing. Sutures through the scleral wall should be covered by a flap to prevent erosion through the conjunctiva. The scleral flap can be created through a conjunctival incision or a tunnel incision dissected posteriorly from the limbus. If dislocation of the IOL is complete, pars plana vitrectomy techniques are required to retrieve the lens or lens-&#173;capsule complex and elevate it safely into the anterior segment, where it can then be suture fixated to the iris or sclera through an anterior approach. Alternatively, the IOL haptics may be externalized through the sulcus, inserted into prepared scleral tunnels, and fixated with tissue adhesive. In some cases, the implant may be removed altogether and replaced with either an ACIOL or a transscleral or iris-&#173;fixated PCIOL. Suture breakage and subluxation of scleral-&#173;fixated sutured IOLs occurring 3–9&#160;years after implantation with 10-0&#160;polypropylene fixation sutures have been reported. Double-&#173;fixation techniques and thicker 9-0&#160;polypropylene or 8-0&#160;Gore-Tex sutures (off-&#173;label use) are currently recommended for scleral fixation of IOLs. Other complications of sutured IOLs include vitreous or suprachoroidal hemorrhage, lens tilting, CME, retinal tears or detachment, suture erosion, and infection. (See also BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text">An ACIOL may be associated with decentration, iris tucking, UGH syndrome, corneal edema, or pseudophakodonesis, which would prompt repositioning of the lens or IOL exchange with either a differently sized flexible ACIOL or, preferably, a PCIOL. An ACIOL associated with pseudophakic bullous keratopathy is treated by endothelial or penetrating keratoplasty, usually in combination with IOL exchange.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If an iris-&#173;supported lens becomes dislocated or associated with corneal edema or UGH syndrome, it should be surgically exchanged. If further surgery is contraindicated, repositioning of a partially dislocated lens by pharmacologic manipulation of the pupil and patient positioning may be successful.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Postoperative pupillary capture of the IOL optic can occur for various reasons, such as formation of synechiae between the iris and underlying posterior capsule, improper placement of the IOL haptics, shallowing of the anterior chamber, or anterior displacement of the <br />PCIOL optic. The last of these is associated with placement of nonangulated IOLs in <br />the ciliary sulcus, upside-&#173;down placement of an angulated IOL so that the IOL vaults anteriorly, excessive Soemmering ring formation, or asymmetric capsule contraction. Placement of a posteriorly angulated PCIOL in the capsular bag and creation of an anterior capsulorrhexis smaller than the lens optic decrease the likelihood of pupillary capture.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pupillary capture may be simply a cosmetic concern. If the condition is chronic and the patient is asymptomatic, it can be left untreated. Occasionally, pupillary capture can cause glare, photophobia, chronic uveitis, unintended myopia, or monocular diplopia, which requires surgical repositioning of the lens. In an acute pupillary capture, pharmacologic manipulation of the pupil with the patient in the supine position is sometimes successful in freeing the optic. If conservative management fails, surgical intervention may be required in order to free the iris, lyse synechiae, manage capsule contraction or residual lens proliferation, and reposition the lens (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;8-5, 8-6</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Capsular Block Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Capsular block syndrome (CBS) is caused by the intracapsular accumulation of liquefied material posterior to the nucleus or IOL and subsequent occlusion of the anterior capsulotomy. CBS can occur intraoperatively during hydrodissection of the nucleus and may lead to posterior capsule blowout, especially in eyes with preexisting capsule defects or posterior polar cataract. Early postoperative CBS may occur when residual OVD becomes trapped within the capsular bag, between the posterior capsule and the posterior surface of the IOL. This may cause a myopic shift in the refractive error as a result of anterior displacement of the lens optic. Anterior displacement of the iris diaphragm with shallowing of the anterior chamber may also occur, which must be differentiated from a ciliary block mechanism. If left untreated, CBS may lead to posterior synechiae and secondary glaucoma. Nd:YAG laser anterior capsulotomy peripheral to the optic or posterior capsulotomy results in release of the trapped fluid, with resultant posterior movement of the IOL optic to its intended position, deepening of the anterior chamber, and resolution of the myopic shift.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Late postoperative CBS may occur years after surgery with the accumulation of a turbid or milky fluid between the posterior capsule and the IOL that is consistent with the by-&#173;products of trapped, residual lens epithelial cells. The patient may be asymptomatic, and myopic shift is uncommon in these cases. Simple laser posterior capsulotomy usually resolves this condition without complications.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Uveitis-Glaucoma-Hyphema Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema (UGH) syndrome was first described in the context of rigid or closed-loop ACIOLs. It may also develop in patients with posterior chamber lenses, owing to contact between lens haptics and uveal tissue in the posterior chamber. The classic triad or individual components of the syndrome may occur as a result of inappropriate IOL sizing, contact between the implant and vascular structures or the corneal endothelium, or defects in implant manufacturing. Uveitis, glaucoma, and/or hyphema may respond to treatment with cycloplegics and topical anti-&#173;inflammatory or ocular hypotensive medications. If medical therapy does not sufficiently address the findings or if inflammation threatens either retinal or corneal function, IOL removal must be considered. This procedure may be complicated because of inflammatory scars, particularly in the anterior chamber angle or posterior to the iris. If such scarring is present, the surgeon may need to amputate the haptics from the optic and remove the lens piecemeal, rotating the haptic material out of the synechial tunnels to minimize trauma to the eye. In some cases, it is safer to leave portions of the haptics in place. Early lens explantation may reduce the risk of corneal decompensation and CME.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Pseudophakic Bullous Keratopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Certain IOL designs, particularly iris-clip lenses (iris-&#173;fixated lenses with the optic anterior to the iris) and closed-loop flexible anterior chamber lenses, were associated with an increased risk of corneal decompensation. Iris-clip lenses have been shown to contact the corneal endothelium during eye movement. Endothelial cell loss associated with closed-loop ACIOLs is thought to be due to chronic inflammation and contact between the lens and peripheral corneal endothelial cells. Thus, these two lens types are no longer in clinical use. Patients with underlying corneal endothelial dysfunction such as Fuchs corneal dystrophy have an increased risk of postoperative corneal edema.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Unexpected Refractive Results</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataract surgery and IOL implantation afford an important opportunity to provide patients with desirable refractive outcomes. See Chapter&#160;7 in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;13, <span class="italic">Refractive Surgery,</span> for a discussion of cataract surgery as a refractive procedure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Unintended postoperative refractive errors may be the result of a preoperative error in measurement of axial length or in keratometry readings. Choosing the correct IOL power is more difficult in patients undergoing simultaneous penetrating keratoplasty, in patients with silicone oil in the vitreous cavity, and in patients who have had prior refractive surgery (see Chapter&#160;6). The surgeon’s failure to confirm the proper IOL at the time of surgery may result in implantation of the incorrect lens. Unexpected postoperative refractive results may occur because of the inversion of an angulated IOL or placement of the lens in the sulcus when it was calculated for placement in the capsular bag, either of which results in anterior displacement and changes the effective power of the IOL. The clinician should rule out or treat other causes of an anterior or posterior shift in the IOL position, such as posterior capsule rupture, capsular block, or ciliary block. Mislabeling or manufacturing defects are rarely the cause of these problems. Incorrect lens power should be suspected early in the postoperative course when the visual acuity is less than expected and is confirmed by refraction. Medical-&#173;record documentation of the source of the error and full disclosure to the patient are necessary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the magnitude of the postoperative refractive error produces symptomatic ametropia, anisometropia, or dissatisfaction on the part of the patient, the surgeon can consider several options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">overrefraction for glasses or contact-lens wear</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">IOL exchange</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">insertion of a piggyback IOL</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-19">a secondary keratorefractive procedure</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">IOL Glare, Dysphotopsia, and Opacification</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition to lens decentration and capsular opacification, glare can result when the diameter of the IOL optic is smaller than the diameter of the scotopic pupil. Optics with a square-edge design and multifocal IOLs are more likely to produce glare and halos, even when well centered. Spherical aberration may cause some degree of distortion or glare under scotopic conditions when the pupil is dilated, even if the iris covers the edge of the lens optic. Aspheric IOLs may reduce some of these phenomena and improve contrast sensitivity. Spherical aberration of the cornea changes with age and corneal refractive surgery, and various aspheric IOLs can be matched to the degree of corneal asphericity.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Positive dysphotopsia</span> is described as glare, streaks, flashes, arcs, or halos of light in the midperiphery. It is more common with truncated square-edge IOLs and those manufactured from higher-&#173;index materials. <span class="italic">Negative dysphotopsia</span> is described as an arcuate dark or dim crescent-&#173;shaped region, usually in the temporal visual field. It occurs in the setting of a PCIOL centered in the capsular bag with the anterior capsule edge overlapping the lens optic. Though reported with most styles of PCIOLs, negative dysphotopsia is more common with smaller, square-edge optic designs. Temporal light rays may interact with the nasal lens edge and anterior capsule, causing a shadow (penumbra) on the nasal retina in susceptible eyes. This effect is more common with a miotic or nasally located pupil and is relieved with dilation or by blocking light from the temporal side. Although symptoms are common in the early postoperative period, they improve over time in most patients, presumably as the capsule contracts or opacifies in the periphery. Initially, observation is advised. For patients with prolonged symptoms and compromised vision, surgery may be necessary. Repositioning of the optic anterior to the capsulorrhexis by reverse optic capture through the capsulorrhexis (with the haptics in the capsular bag) or sulcus fixation of an appropriate PCIOL with a larger optic with rounded edges may be successful in most cases. Implantation of a piggyback IOL or an anterior capsulectomy has been successful in some cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several types of IOLs have developed opacities or discoloration, either immediately after implantation or progressively over years. There are many different causes, which vary with the IOL manufacturer, material, and storage, as well as surgical adjuvants and associated patient conditions. Five general processes of IOL opacification have been identified:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">deposits or precipitates on the surface of or in the IOL optic (such as calcium deposits on silicone IOLs in asteroid hyalosis)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">influx of water in hydrophobic optic material (glistenings)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">staining of the IOL by capsular dyes or medications</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">IOL coating by substances such as ophthalmic ointment or silicone oil</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">progressive degradation of the IOL material (such as snowflake degeneration in polymethyl methacrylate [PMMA] IOLs)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Calcium deposition within or on the surface of hydrophilic acrylic lenses can produce significant visual symptoms, and IOL explantation may be required. Calcium deposits on silicone lenses have been reported in eyes with asteroid hyalosis, usually after posterior capsulotomy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Glistenings are fluid-filled microvacuoles that form within an IOL optic when it is in an aqueous environment. They are observed within all types of IOL material but are associated primarily with certain hydrophobic acrylic IOLs. Glistening formation and intensity increase with time. Although their appearance may be striking on slit-lamp examination, glistenings have not been shown to affect best-&#173;corrected visual acuity. Although studies have documented a negative effect on contrast sensitivity at high spatial frequency, IOL explantation for glistenings is rarely reported.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Interlenticular opacifications have been noted between piggybacked PCIOLs, especially in cases when both are made of hydrophobic acrylic material and placed in the capsular bag. Using IOLs made of 2&#160;different materials, enlarging the capsulorrhexis, and placing 1&#160;lens in the capsular bag and 1 in the sulcus may reduce the incidence.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with diffractive or refractive multifocal IOLs are more likely to experience glare, decreased contrast sensitivity, or loss of desired multifocality with minor IOL decentration, altered pupil diameter or position, or posterior capsule opacity. A pseudoaccommodating lens may vault anteriorly (a condition known as Z&#160;syndrome) due to misplaced haptics or asymmetric capsular contraction. This syndrome can often be managed by posterior capsulotomy, but the lens may need to be surgically repositioned or explanted.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Toric IOLs must be located on a precise axis for maximal astigmatic correction. These lenses may need to be repositioned if they are placed improperly or rotate postoperatively. Toric IOL rotation is more common in highly myopic eyes when the lens is oriented in the vertical meridian.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-23">Capsular Opacification and Contraction</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Posterior Capsule Opacification</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common late complication of cataract surgery by means of ECCE or phacoemulsification is posterior capsule opacification (PCO). In addition, contracture of a continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis may occlude the visual axis because of anterior capsule fibrosis and phimosis. Posterior or anterior capsule opacification is amenable to treatment by intraocular peeling or polishing of the capsule or by means of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Capsular opacification stems from the continued viability of lens epithelial cells that remain after removal of the nucleus and cortex. Opaque secondary membranes are formed by proliferating lens epithelial cells, fibroblastic metaplasia, and collagen deposition. Lens epithelial cells proliferate in several patterns. Sequestration of nucleated bladder cells <span class="italic">(Wedl cells)</span> in a closed space between the adherent edges of the anterior and posterior capsule results in a doughnut-&#173;shaped configuration, referred to as a <span class="italic">Soemmering ring.</span> If the epithelial cells migrate out of the capsular bag, translucent globular masses resembling fish eggs <span class="italic">(Elschnig pearls)</span> form on the edge of the capsular opening. These pearls can fill the pupil or remain hidden behind the iris. Histologic examination shows that these “fish eggs” are nucleated bladder cells, identical to those proliferating within the capsule of a Soemmering ring but usually lacking a basement membrane. If the epithelial cells migrate across the anterior or posterior capsule, they may cause capsular wrinkling and opacification. Significantly, the lens epithelial cells are capable of undergoing metaplasia with conversion to myofibroblasts. These cells can produce a matrix of fibrous and basement membrane collagen. Contraction of this collagen matrix causes wrinkles in the posterior capsule, with resultant distortion of vision and glare.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The reported incidence of PCO varies widely but has been diminishing with current IOL design and placement. Older studies report that the frequency of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy varies between 3% and 53% within 3&#160;years of cataract surgery. More recent clinical series with a 3- to 5-year follow-&#173;up of cases with either hydrophobic acrylic or silicone square-edge design show PCO rates between 0% and 4.7%. Factors thought to influence this rate include the age of the patient, history of intraocular inflammation, presence of pseudoexfoliation syndrome, size of the anterior capsulorrhexis, quality of the cortical cleanup, capsular fixation of the implant, design of the lens implant (specifically, a reduction in incidence with posterior convex or a truncated square-edge optic design), modification of the lens surface, and time elapsed since surgery. There seems to be no difference in PCO rates with prolonged use of postoperative topical corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The presence of intraocular silicone oil may dramatically speed up the progression of PCO.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The IOL material has a modest effect on opacification rates. Hydrogel IOLs lead to the highest rate, followed by PMMA, then silicone; hydrophobic acrylic material IOLs lead to the lowest rate. However, the IOL design is now considered the dominant factor both in inhibiting posterior migration of lens epithelial cells and in influencing the rate of PCO. The truncated-&#173;edge design is associated with lower rates of PCO in both silicone and acrylic IOLs, although these lenses may increase the incidence of undesirable optical reflections and positive dysphotopsias.</p>

			<p class="h2">Anterior Capsule Fibrosis and Phimosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Capsular fibrosis is associated with clouding of the anterior capsule. If a substantial portion of the IOL optic is covered by the opaque anterior capsule, including portions exposed through the undilated pupil, the patient may become symptomatic. Symptoms may include glare, especially at night due to physiologic mydriasis in darkness, or a perception that vision has become cloudy or hazy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The term <span class="italic">capsular phimosis</span> is used to describe the postoperative contraction of the anterior capsule opening as a result of circumferential fibrosis. Phimosis produces symptoms similar to and often more pronounced than those of fibrosis itself and may cause stress on the zonular fibers or decentration of an IOL optic. Anterior capsule contraction and fibrosis occur more frequently with smaller capsulorrhexis openings, in patients with underlying pseudoexfoliation syndrome, and in other situations with abnormal or asymmetric zonular support (eg, penetrating or blunt trauma, Marfan syndrome, or surgical trauma). Anterior capsule contraction may contribute to late pseudophakodonesis or in-the-bag IOL subluxation due to stress on the zonular apparatus. Anterior capsule polishing to remove residual lens epithelial cells may help reduce anterior capsule contraction but not PCO.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Capsular phimosis can be treated with several radial Nd:YAG anterior capsulotomies to release the annular contraction, reduce the traction on the zonular fibers, and enlarge the anterior capsule opening (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-7</span>). This procedure is performed in a fashion similar to Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy, with care taken to not defocus too far posteriorly and damage the underlying IOL with laser pitting. In general, the anterior capsule tissue or a fibrotic ring is tougher and thus requires more laser power than does the posterior capsule.</p>
			<p class="h2">Nd:YAG Laser Capsulotomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Use of the Nd:YAG laser is now a standard procedure for the treatment of secondary opacification of the posterior capsule or contraction of the anterior capsule. Alternatively, intraocular surgical cleaning of the capsule may be performed during the course of concurrent anterior segment surgery if it is desirable to maintain an intact posterior capsule. If possible, posterior capsulotomy should be delayed until there is adequate apposition and fusion of the anterior and posterior capsule peripheral to the lens optic to reduce the possibility of vitreous prolapse around the IOL and into the anterior chamber. Otherwise, an ideal time to perform posterior capsulotomy for treatment of symptomatic posterior capsule opacity has not been established.</p>
			<p class="h3">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following are indications for Nd:YAG capsulotomy:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">visual acuity symptomatically decreased as a result of PCO</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">a hazy posterior capsule preventing the clear view of the ocular fundus required for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">monocular diplopia, a Maddox rod–like effect, or glare caused by wrinkling of the posterior capsule or by encroachment of a partially opened posterior capsule into the visual axis</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">contraction of anterior capsulotomy (capsular phimosis), causing encroachment on the visual axis, excessive traction on the zonular fibers, or alteration of the lens optic position</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-19">capsular block syndrome</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3">Contraindications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following are contraindications for Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-9">inadequate visualization of the posterior capsule</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">a patient who is unable to remain still or hold fixation during the procedure (use of a contact lens or retrobulbar anesthesia may enhance the feasibility of a capsulotomy in such patients)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-19">active intraocular inflammation, uncontrolled glaucoma, high risk of retinal detachment, and suspected CME are all relative contraindications</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3">Procedure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Observation of the posterior capsule through an undilated pupil can help the surgeon pinpoint the location of the visual axis. The center of the visual axis is the desired site for the opening, which is usually adequate at 3–4&#160;mm in diameter. In some circumstances, larger-&#173;diameter openings may be required for more complete visualization of the fundus. Dilation is not always necessary for the procedure but may be helpful if a larger opening in the posterior capsule is desired. When viewing the posterior capsule, the surgeon should note <span class="italic">before</span> dilation any specific landmarks near the visual axis, because the location of the visual axis may not be obvious through the dilated pupil.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A high-plus-powered anterior segment laser lens, used with topical anesthesia, improves ocular stability and enlarges the cone angle of the beam, reducing the depth of focus. The smaller focus diameter facilitates the laser pulse puncture of the capsule, and structures in front of and behind the point of focus are less likely to be damaged.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Capsulotomy can be performed in a spiral (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-8A</span>), cruciate (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-8B</span>), or inverted-&#173;D-shaped pattern, beginning in the periphery to reduce the likelihood of central optic pitting until ideal energy levels and focus have been established. Occasional IOL dislocation into the vitreous following capsulotomy has been reported, particularly with silicone plate-&#173;haptic lenses. Constructing the capsulotomy in a spiraling circular pattern, rather than in a cruciate pattern, creates an opening that is less likely to extend radially, reducing the risk of dislocation. Also, the diameter of the capsulotomy should not exceed that of the IOL optic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If minimal laser energy is applied, the anterior vitreous face may remain intact. A ruptured anterior vitreous face will usually not result in anterior chamber prolapse by the barrier effect of a PCIOL, although vitreous strands occasionally migrate around the lens and through the pupil.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any PCIOL can be damaged by laser energy, but the threshold for lens damage appears to be lower for silicone than for other materials. The laser pulse should be focused just behind the posterior capsule; pulses too far behind the IOL will be ineffective. The safest approach is to focus the laser beam slightly behind the posterior surface of the capsule for the initial application and then move anteriorly for subsequent applications, until the desired puncture is achieved.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In cases of anterior capsule contraction, multiple relaxing incisions of the fibrotic ring relieve the contracting force and create a larger optical opening (see Fig&#160;8-7).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The success rate of Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy exceeds 95%. Occasionally, the Nd:YAG laser is insufficient to address exceptionally dense fibrosis, which may require surgical manipulation with a discission knife, vitrectomy handpiece, or scissors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to capsulotomy, the Nd:YAG laser can be used for vitreolysis, synechialysis, iris cystotomy, iridotomy, anterior hyaloidotomy for ciliary block, removal of precipitates and membranes from an IOL surface, and fragmentation of retained cortical material.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complications of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy include transient or long-term elevated IOP, retinal detachment, CME, hyphema, damage to or dislocation of the IOL, corneal edema, and corneal abrasions (from the focusing contact lens for the laser surgery). Transient elevation of IOP occurs in a significant number of patients, with pressure levels peaking 2–3&#160;hours after surgery. This elevation is likely due to obstruction of the outflow pathways by debris scattered by the laser treatment. It is more common in eyes with vitreous prolapse, those without in-the-bag fixation of the IOL, or those with preexisting glaucoma. Such elevation responds quickly to topical glaucoma medications, which can be continued for 3–5&#160;days following the procedure. For any type of laser capsular surgery, many surgeons prescribe prophylactic preoperative and postoperative ocular hypotensive medications (<span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-adrenergic agonist or <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker drops), as well as either topical corticosteroids or NSAIDs to reduce the risk of postprocedure IOP spikes, inflammation, and CME.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy may increase the risk of retinal detachment; the reported incidence is 0%–3.6%. Approximately 50%–75% of the retinal detachments following cataract extraction occur within 1&#160;year of surgery or within 6&#160;months of capsulotomy, often in association with a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). In many cases, it is difficult to ascertain whether the retinal detachment is related to the capsulotomy or to the cataract surgery itself or whether it is simply a consequence of a naturally occurring PVD. Axial myopia, male sex, young age, trauma, vitreous prolapse, a family history of retinal detachment, and preexisting vitreoretinal pathology are factors that increase the risk of retinal detachment following Nd:YAG capsulotomy. All patients at increased risk of retinal detachment should be instructed to promptly report any new symptoms suggesting a PVD or retinal tear.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CME can occur following Nd:YAG capsulotomy. In patients with a history of CME, or in high-risk patients such as those with diabetic retinopathy, the prophylactic use of topical corticosteroids or NSAIDs may be beneficial.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Systemic Anticoagulation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A large, prospective cohort study did not show an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications in patients on anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy during cataract surgery. In addition, no increase in the risk of medical complications was observed when such therapy was temporarily discontinued for surgery. This result contrasts with earlier reports suggesting that anticoagulation increases the risk of suprachoroidal effusion and hemorrhage, and with more recent reports that cessation of anticoagulation therapy carries significant risks of thromboembolic complications. In general, patients undergoing cataract surgery with topical or sub-&#173;Tenon anesthesia do not require cessation of anticoagulant therapy. If the surgeon is considering discontinuation of anticoagulants, consultation with the patient’s primary care physician is recommended.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Retrobulbar Hemorrhage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retrobulbar hemorrhages are more common with retrobulbar anesthetic injections than with peribulbar injections, and they may vary in intensity. These hemorrhages have become rare with the declining use of retrobulbar injections for cataract surgery. Reports estimate the incidence of significant retrobulbar hemorrhage after retrobulbar injection to be 0.44%–0.74%.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Venous retrobulbar hemorrhages</span> are usually self-&#173;limited and tend to spread slowly. They often do not require treatment. <span class="italic">Arterial retrobulbar hemorrhages</span> occur more rapidly and are associated with taut orbital swelling, marked proptosis, elevated IOP, reduced mobility of the globe, inability to separate the eyelids, and massive ecchymosis of the eyelids and conjunctiva. This type of retrobulbar hemorrhage causes an increase in orbital volume and associated orbital pressure, which can restrict the vascular supply to the globe. Large orbital vessels may be occluded. Tamponade of the smaller vessels in the optic nerve may occur, resulting in severe vision loss from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and subsequent optic atrophy, despite the absence of obvious retinal vascular occlusion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ophthalmologists can often make the diagnosis of retrobulbar hemorrhage by observing the rapid onset of eyelid and conjunctival ecchymosis and tightening of the orbit. The diagnosis can be confirmed by tonometry revealing elevated IOP. Direct ophthalmoscopy may reveal pulsation or occlusion of the central retinal artery in severe cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of acute retrobulbar hemorrhage consists of maneuvers to lower the intraocular and orbital pressure as quickly as possible. These may include digital massage, intravenous osmotic agents, aqueous suppressants, lateral canthotomy and cantholysis, localized conjunctival peritomy (to allow egress of blood), and occasionally anterior chamber paracentesis. The planned surgery should be postponed until the IOP and mobility of the globe and eyelids are normal. To reduce the risk of a recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhage, it may be advisable to use another form of anesthesia for the second attempt at surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to retrobulbar hemorrhage, potential complications of retrobulbar injections include central retinal artery occlusion, ischemic optic neuropathy, toxic neuropathy or myopathy, diplopia, ptosis, and inadvertent subdural injections with possible CNS depression and apnea. Ischemic complications are more common if epinephrine is used in the anesthetic.

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-24">Hyphema</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hyphema in the immediate postoperative period usually originates from the incision or the iris. It is commonly mild and resolves spontaneously. The risk of hyphema is greater in patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome, anterior segment neovascularization, Fuchs heterochromic uveitis, or vascular tufts at the pupillary margin. Resolution may take longer if vitreous is mixed with the blood. The two&#160;major complications from prolonged hyphema are elevated IOP and corneal blood staining. IOP should be monitored closely and initially treated medically, although it may be difficult to control if the blood is mixed with the OVD used during the procedure. Surgical evacuation is occasionally necessary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hyphema occurring months to years after surgery is usually the result of incision vascularization or erosion of vascular tissue in the iris or ciliary body by an IOL haptic or optic edge. Argon laser photocoagulation of the bleeding vessel, often performed through a goniolens, may stop the bleeding or prevent rebleeding. To reduce the risk of continued or recurrent bleeding, antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy may be withheld, if medically possible, until the hyphema resolves. Occasionally, it is necessary to reposition or exchange an IOL that comes in contact with iris or angle structures and results in recurrent intraocular hemorrhage.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Suprachoroidal Effusion or Hemorrhage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Suprachoroidal effusion with or without suprachoroidal hemorrhage usually occurs intraoperatively, but may also occur later in cases with prolonged postoperative hypotony. Suprachoroidal effusion typically presents as a forward prolapse of ocular structures, including iris, lens diaphragm, and vitreous, generally accompanied by a change in the red reflex. Clinically, suprachoroidal effusion may be difficult to differentiate from suprachoroidal hemorrhage. Patient agitation and pain followed by an extremely firm globe suggest suprachoroidal hemorrhage. Both complications are more common in the presence of associated hypertension, arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, tachycardia, obesity, high myopia, glaucoma, advanced age, nanophthalmos, choroidal hemangioma associated with Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome, or chronic ocular inflammation. Fortunately, both suprachoroidal effusion and suprachoroidal hemorrhage are much less likely with small-&#173;incision phacoemulsification than with larger-&#173;incision surgery because the relatively closed system formed by the small, self-&#173;sealing incisions and the relatively tight fit of the phaco tip in the incision prevents prolonged hypotony and reduces intraoperative fluctuations in IOP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Suprachoroidal effusion may be a precursor to suprachoroidal hemorrhage. Exudation of fluid from choroidal vasculature ultimately stretches veins or arteries that supply the choroid after coursing through the sclera. If suprachoroidal hemorrhage occurs in this situation, it is presumably a result of disruption of one or more of these taut blood vessels. Alternatively, suprachoroidal hemorrhage may represent a spontaneous rupture of choroidal vasculature, particularly in patients with underlying systemic vascular disease. (See also BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span>)</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Expulsive Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Expulsive suprachoroidal hemorrhage, a rare but serious condition, generally occurs intraoperatively. The hemorrhage usually presents as a sudden increase in IOP accompanied by acute onset of pain and the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-14">darkening of the red reflex</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">incision gape</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">iris prolapse</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-15">expulsion of the lens, vitreous, and bright red blood</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The instant this condition is recognized, the surgeon must close the incision with sutures or digital pressure. Prolapsed vitreous should be excised and uveal tissue, reposited. After the wound is securely closed, the surgeon may consider posterior sclerotomies to allow the escape of suprachoroidal blood to decompress the globe, enable repositioning of prolapsed intraocular tissue, and facilitate permanent closure of the cataract incision. Drainage of suprachoroidal blood may be achieved by performing sclerotomies in one or more quadrants, 5–7&#160;mm posterior to the limbus. Elevated IOP serves both to stop bleeding and to expel suprachoroidal blood. Once there is optimal clearance of blood from the suprachoroidal space, the sclerotomies may be left open to allow further drainage postoperatively. It may be necessary to repeat the drainage procedure 7&#160;days or more after an expulsive hemorrhage in cases of residual suprachoroidal blood that threatens ocular integrity or vision. These procedures may lower dangerously elevated IOPs and restore appropriate anatomical relationships within the eye, but they carry some risk that bleeding will recur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the incision can be closed without posterior sclerotomies, more rapid tamponade of the bleeding vessel can be achieved. Most surgeons would then terminate the operation and observe for 7–14&#160;days to allow clotting and liquefaction of the hemorrhage, while managing elevated IOP medically. Referral to a vitreoretinal surgeon for management and subsequent drainage of choroidal hemorrhage should be considered. The patient needs to be informed of the guarded prognosis for restoration of vision.</p>
			<p class="h2">Delayed Suprachoroidal Hemorrhage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Delayed suprachoroidal hemorrhage may occur in the early postoperative period, presenting with sudden onset of pain, loss of vision, and shallowing of the anterior chamber. Predisposing factors for postoperative choroidal hemorrhage or effusion include prolonged hypotony, wound leak, unrecognized scleral perforation, trauma, uveitis, cyclodialysis, and excessive filtration. This condition is far more common after glaucoma filtering procedures than routine cataract surgery and may also arise following laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy. If the incision remains intact and the IOP can be controlled medically, limited suprachoroidal hemorrhage may be observed and frequently will resolve spontaneously. If the incision is not intact, surgical revision may be sufficient to allow the hemorrhage to resolve. Medical management consists of systemic corticosteroids, topical and oral ocular hypotensive agents for elevated IOP, topical cycloplegia, and close observation. Surgical drainage of the suprachoroidal space is indicated if there is a flat anterior chamber, medically uncontrolled glaucoma, or persistent or adherent (kissing) choroidal detachments.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-25">Endophthalmitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endophthalmitis is a rare but dreaded complication of cataract surgery that may lead to severe loss of vision or loss of the eye. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential for achieving a satisfactory outcome. Recent large retrospective studies of the incidence of endophthalmitis after cataract surgery reveal rates between 0.04% and 0.20%. Some studies, particularly with older data, reveal higher rates. A comprehensive review of 440,000&#160;consecutive cataract surgeries performed in Canada from 2002 to 2006 revealed an incidence of 0.14%. Factors that increase the risk of infection include diabetes mellitus, older age, male gender, complicated or prolonged surgery, vitreous loss, posterior capsule rupture, wound leaks, and possibly the use of clear corneal incisions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Infectious endophthalmitis may present in an acute form or in a more indolent or chronic form; the latter is associated with organisms of lower pathogenicity. The symptoms of endophthalmitis include mild to severe ocular pain, vision loss, floaters, and photophobia. The hallmark of endophthalmitis is vitreous inflammation, but other signs include eyelid or periorbital edema, ciliary injection, chemosis, anterior chamber inflammation, hypopyon, decreased visual acuity, corneal edema, and retinal hemorrhages (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-9</span>). Most cases present within 3–10&#160;days of surgery, with a median of 6&#160;days, as reported in the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS). A significant percentage (22%) of cases presented 2–6&#160;weeks after surgery. The most common bacterial causes in that study were gram-&#173;positive coagulase-&#173;negative <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> (70%), <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (9.9%), <span class="italic">Streptococcus</span> species (9.0%), other gram-&#173;positive bacteria (3.1%), <span class="italic">Enterococcus</span> species (2.2%), and gram-&#173;negative bacteria (5.9%). Most infections are caused by organisms similar to the patients’ own periocular bacterial flora. Drug-&#173;resistant strains are becoming more common.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To reduce the risk of infection, preoperative 10% povidone-&#173;iodine skin prep, povidone-&#173;iodine 5% drops, careful eyelid and eyelash draping, and sterile technique should be utilized. This method is the most effective and least expensive way to reduce the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis. Meticulous attention to watertight incision closure is also important in preventing endophthalmitis, particularly when clear corneal incisions are employed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prophylactic preoperative and postoperative topical antibiotics are usually prescribed for cataract surgery, although there are no randomized clinical studies to support this practice.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In 2006, the Endophthalmitis Study Group of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) reported a decrease in endophthalmitis rates from 0.34% to 0.07% in patients given intracameral cefuroxime 1&#160;mg at the conclusion of surgery <br />in comparison to patients given topical levofloxacin alone. The high incidence of infection in <br />the control group confounded the results. The ESCRS also reported a 4.92-fold increase <br />in endophthalmitis when intracameral cefuroxime was not used and a 5.88-fold increase in risk with the use of clear corneal incisions instead of scleral tunnels. Other studies have also supported the use of an intracameral bolus of antibiotic at the conclusion of surgery. Although the practice is not universally accepted, many surgeons use an intracameral antibiotic such as vancomycin, moxifloxacin, or a broad-&#173;spectrum cephalosporin. Given the difficulty of obtaining commercially available, preservative-&#173;free antibiotics in doses appropriate for intracameral prophylaxis, surgeons must weigh these results against the risk of TASS from dilutional errors or preservative toxicity.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Acute</span> endophthalmitis, defined as occurring within 6&#160;weeks of surgery, typically develops 3–10&#160;days postoperatively and runs a fulminant course. Early diagnosis is extremely important, as delay of treatment can substantially alter the visual prognosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Chronic</span> endophthalmitis, in contrast, may develop weeks or months after surgery. It may be characterized by chronic iridocyclitis or granulomatous uveitis and is often associated with decreased vision, little or no pain, and the presence of a nidus of the infectious agent within the eye. The most common causes are <span class="italic">P&#160;acnes, S&#160;epidermidis,</span> and fungi. (See also BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text">Acute infectious endophthalmitis must be differentiated from TASS (discussed earlier in this chapter). The clinical presentation is often diagnostic, but occasionally the clinician may be able to diagnose sterile endophthalmitis only by excluding possible infectious causes by means of appropriate aqueous and vitreous cultures.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The recommended approach to the diagnosis and management of postoperative endoph&#173;thalmitis is based on the results of the EVS. As soon as a clinical diagnosis of endophthalmitis is suspected, assessment of visual acuity will help direct management decisions. Needle biopsy for anterior chamber and vitreous samples for culture and Gram stain will help determine the appropriate antibiotic selection. Fortified topical antibiotics may be started if doing so does not delay referral to a vitreoretinal specialist. Immediate pars plana vitrectomy and antibiotic injections are indicated when the patient’s visual acuity has been reduced to light perception.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When the visual acuity is hand motions or better, a less-&#173;invasive anterior chamber and vitreous biopsy for cultures with subsequent intravitreal injection of antibiotics may be sufficient. To expedite the delivery of antibiotics, this procedure can be performed in the office under sterile conditions. Because clinical features do not distinguish between gram-&#173;positive and gram-&#173;negative organisms, the mainstay of treatment for both remains broad-&#173;spectrum intravitreal antibiotics. Currently, vancomycin 1&#160;mg and ceftazidime 2.25&#160;mg or amikacin 0.4&#160;mg are preferred. Fortified topical or subconjunctival antibiotics are administered in the period following intravitreal antibiotic injection while waiting for culture results. Topical cycloplegic and corticosteroid drops are advised. Intravenous or oral antibiotics have shown little benefit, although bactericidal aqueous and intravitreal concentrations of parenteral fourth-&#173;generation fluoroquinolones have been documented. Although intravitreal corticosteroids are frequently used because of their theoretical role in reducing inflammation and scarring, their benefit has yet to be demonstrated in a controlled study.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chronic or delayed-onset endophthalmitis is also best treated with vitreous biopsy and intraocular antibiotics. However, due to sequestration of infectious material in the capsular bag or vitreous, a vitrectomy and posterior capsulectomy or even IOL exchange is often necessary to remove the nidus of infection.

			<p class="h2-h1">Cystoid Macular Edema</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cystoid macular edema (CME) after cataract surgery, also known as <span class="italic">Irvine-&#173;Gass syndrome,</span> is a common cause of postoperative decreased vision. Although the pathogenesis of CME is unknown, the final common pathway appears to be increased perifoveal capillary permeability with accumulation of fluid in the inner nuclear and outer plexiform layers. CME is often associated with intraocular inflammation and may be mediated through the release of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CME may be recognized by an otherwise unexplained reduction in vision, by the characteristic petaloid appearance of cystic spaces in the macula on ophthalmoscopy or fluorescein angiography (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-10A</span>), or by cystic areas of low reflectivity and retinal thickening on spectral-&#173;domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-10B</span>). Angiographic evidence of CME occurs in 40%–70% of eyes following ICCE and in approximately 1%–19% of eyes following ECCE via nucleus expression or phacoemulsification. OCT studies may detect postoperative macular thickening in up to 41% of eyes following phacoemulsification. Most of the affected patients are asymptomatic, although there may be some loss of contrast sensitivity even in the absence of reduced Snellen visual acuity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the diagnosis of clinically significant CME is based on vision loss to the 20/40&#160;level or worse, the incidence is 2%–10% following intracapsular surgery and 1%–2% following extracapsular surgery with an intact posterior capsule. The risk of clinical CME after small-&#173;incision phacoemulsification with an intact posterior capsule is believed to be even lower (0.10%–2.35%). However, patients with angiographic CME after phacoemulsification score significantly lower in logMAR (logarithm of minimum angle of resolution) visual acuity than do patients with no CME, even though their Snellen visual acuities remain better than 20/40.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The peak incidence of both angiographic and clinical CME occurs 6–10&#160;weeks after surgery. Spontaneous resolution occurs in approximately 95% of uncomplicated cases, usually within 3–12&#160;months. In rare cases, CME may develop many years after surgery, especially in association with delayed postoperative rupture of the anterior vitreous face. CME has also been associated with the use of topical epinephrine and dipivefrin for the treatment of aphakic glaucoma. Prostaglandin analogues have been associated with reversible CME in eyes that have undergone recent intraocular surgery, although a cause-and-&#173;effect relationship has not been established. The risk is believed to be greater in the absence of an intact posterior capsule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Preoperative risk factors for CME include coexisting uveitis, preexisting epiretinal membrane, vitreomacular traction, diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy, previous retinal vein occlusion, retinitis pigmentosa, and previous occurrence of CME. Surgical and postoperative risk factors include posterior capsule rupture, vitreous loss, iris prolapse, prolonged surgical time, improper IOL positioning, retained lens fragments, poorly controlled postoperative inflammation, and transient or prolonged hypotony.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The risk of CME may be reduced with postoperative prophylactic use of topical corticosteroids and/or NSAID drops. A meta-&#173;analysis of randomized clinical trials found that topical NSAIDs alone or in combination with corticosteroids reduced the odds of developing CME in the first 3 months after cataract surgery. A recent American Academy of Ophthalmology report found that topical NSAIDs after cataract surgery are effective in reducing the incidence of CME detected by angiography or OCT and hasten the visual recovery in the short term. There is a lack of level&#160;1 evidence supporting the long-term benefit of NSAID therapy when applied alone or in combination with corticosteroid therapy to prevent vision loss from CME at 3 months or more after cataract surgery. Furthermore, although use of NSAIDs before surgery may increase the speed of visual recovery in the first several postoperative weeks, there is no evidence that this practice affects long-term visual outcomes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Medical treatment of chronic postoperative CME typically begins with a course of anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs such as topical corticosteroids, NSAIDs, or both. Controlled clinical studies have not identified a superior regimen. However, a prospective randomized clinical trial for treatment of chronic CME found that combination therapy with ketorolac 0.5% and prednisolone acetate 1.0% four times a day was more effective than either drug alone in improving visual acuity. Topical anti-&#173;inflammatory therapy may take 3–6&#160;months to resolve chronic CME, and the condition may recur after cessation of therapy. If topical medications fail, sub-&#173;Tenon steroid injection or intravitreal injections of corticosteroids alone or via a sustained drug-&#173;delivery system may be effective. In refractory cases, systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may be beneficial. Intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors have been used with success in chronic CME cases that do not respond to conventional treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgical therapy may be indicated when an inciting source of chronic CME can be defined and the edema fails to respond to medical therapy. Any retained lens fragments should be removed. Nd:YAG laser vitreolysis or vitrectomy can be used to remove vitreous adhering to the cataract incision in order to relieve iris deformity or vitreomacular traction. If the IOL is malpositioned and contributing to chronic uveitis, repositioning or exchange may be helpful. For further discussion of CME, see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>

			<p class="h2">Retinal Light Toxicity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prolonged exposure to the illuminating filament of the operating microscope can result in an increased risk of CME or a burn to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The risk of an RPE burn is particularly high during cataract surgery, when the filtering effects of the natural lens (cataract) are removed, exposing the vulnerable RPE to unfiltered blue light and near-&#173;ultraviolet (near-UV) radiation. If a burn occurs, a central or paracentral scotoma may result. Minimizing retinal exposure to the operating microscope light, filtering light wavelengths below 515&#160;nm, and, when possible, using pupillary shields and oblique lighting reduce the risk of this complication.</p>

			<p class="h2">Retinal Detachment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is an uncommon but serious complication of cataract surgery. The incidence of pseudophakic RRD has been reported at 0.2%–3.6%, depending on follow-&#173;up time and patient demographics. RRD occurs most frequently within 1&#160;year of cataract surgery or 6&#160;months following posterior capsulotomy. During the first postoperative year following phacoemulsification, the incidence of RRD ranges from 0.6% to 1.7%, with an average of 0.7%. The cumulative risk for pseudophakic RRD increases with time. For all age and gender groups, eyes that have undergone cataract surgery have a fourfold-&#173;higher risk of RRD when compared with fellow phakic eyes. The incidence of RRD was 2&#160;times higher following ICCE than ECCE and has continued to decline since the adoption of small-&#173;incision phacoemulsification surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most acute RRDs are subsequent to a PVD. Uncomplicated cataract surgery and laser posterior capsulotomy are risk factors for RRD in part because these procedures are risk factors for earlier onset of PVD. Myopic eyes have a much higher risk of RRD whether pseudophakic or phakic, and this risk rises with each additional millimeter of axial length. Predisposing risk factors for RRD include axial myopia (6- to 10-times-&#173;greater risk with axial length &gt;25&#160;mm), younger age (4-times-&#173;greater risk with age &lt;60&#160;years), male gender, lattice degeneration of the retina, a previous retinal tear or detachment in the surgical eye, a history of retinal detachment in the fellow eye, or a family history of retinal detachment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The presence of an intact posterior capsule reduces the incidence of RRD. Conversely, the risk of postoperative RRD after cataract surgery complicated by posterior capsule rupture is increased at least tenfold. Some studies have reported that Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy may increase the risk for RRD by 3.9–4.9&#160;times, whereas other studies found no evidence of increased risk caused by capsulotomy. The rate of RRD after uncomplicated Nd:YAG capsulotomy without vitreous prolapse may be equal to the spontaneous rate in a matched pseudophakic population. Neither the size of the capsulotomy nor the total energy delivered is thought to increase risk.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The successful repair of retinal detachment is not influenced by the presence or absence of either an ACIOL or a PCIOL. Pars plana vitrectomy with or without a scleral buckle is the most commonly used procedure for repair of RRD; the success rate is approximately 85% with one operation and ultimately 98% with multiple procedures.
