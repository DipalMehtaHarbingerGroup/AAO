			<div id="Chapt2_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The eye is a fascinating and complex organ, an anatomical win&#173;dow into the ner&#173;vous and vascular systems that can reveal systemic disease. More than 80% of our sensory input comes through sight. This chapter discusses the anatomy of the major parts of the &#173;human eye. The reader is encouraged to consult other volumes in the BCSC series for further discussion of many of the topics presented in this chapter.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Topographic Features of the Globe</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The eyeball, or globe, is not a true sphere. The radius of curvature of the prolate (polar radius greater than equatorial radius, or “pointy”) cornea is 8&#160;mm, smaller than that of the sclera, which is 12&#160;mm. This makes the globe an oblate “squashed” spheroid (equatorial radius greater than polar radius). The anteroposterior dia&#173;meter of the adult eye is approximately 23–25&#160;mm. The average transverse dia&#173;meter of the adult eye is 24&#160;mm (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The eye contains 3 compartments: the anterior chamber, the posterior chamber, and the vitreous cavity. The anterior chamber, the space between the iris and the cornea, is filled with aqueous fluid. Anterior chamber depth varies among individuals and in regional populations; the average depth is 3.11 mm. The average volume of the anterior chamber is 220 <span class="greek">μ</span>L. The posterior chamber is the anatomical portion of the eye posterior to the iris and anterior to the lens and vitreous face. It is also filled with aqueous fluid and has an average volume of 60 <span class="greek">μ</span>L. The largest compartment is the vitreous cavity, which makes up more than two-&#173;thirds of the volume of the eye (5–6&#160;mL) and contains the vitreous gel (also called <span class="italic">vitreous, vitreous body,</span> or <span class="italic">vitreous humor</span>). The total volume of the average adult eye is approximately 6.5–7.0&#160;mL (&#173;Table&#160;2-1).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The eyeball is composed of 3 concentric layers: an outer protective layer, a &#173;middle vascular layer, and an inner neural layer. The outermost layer consists of the clear <span class="italic">cornea</span> anteriorly and the opaque white <span class="italic">sclera</span> posteriorly. This corneoscleral layer is composed of collagen and protects the internal ocular tissues.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cornea occupies the center of the anterior pole of the globe. &#173;Because the sclera and conjunctiva overlap the cornea anteriorly, slightly more above and below than medially and laterally, the cornea appears elliptical when viewed from the front. The <span class="italic">limbus,</span> which borders the cornea and the sclera, is blue-&#173;gray and translucent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The &#173;middle layer of the globe, the <span class="italic">uvea,</span> consists of the choroid, ciliary body, and iris. Highly vascular, it serves nutritive and supportive functions, supplying oxygen to the outer ret&#173;ina and producing aqueous humor.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The innermost layer is the <span class="italic">ret&#173;i&#173;na.</span> This photosensitive layer contains the photoreceptors and neural ele&#173;ments that initiate the pro&#173;cessing of visual information.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other impor&#173;tant surface features of the globe, such as the vortex veins, the posterior ciliary artery and nerves, and extraocular muscle insertions are discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1;</span> the optic nerve and its surrounding meningeal sheaths are discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;3</span>.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Precorneal Tear Film</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The exposed surfaces of the cornea and bulbar conjunctiva are covered by the <span class="italic">precorneal tear film,</span> which was formerly described as having 3 layers: lipid (from meibomian glands), aqueous (from the lacrimal gland), and mucin (primarily from goblet cells). It is now thought of as a lipid layer with under&#173;lying uniform gel consisting of soluble mucus (secreted by conjunctival goblet cells), mixed with fluids and proteins (secreted by the lacrimal glands). A glycocalyx mediates the interaction of the mucoaqueous layer with surface epithelial cells of the cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Maintenance of the precorneal tear film is vital for normal corneal function. The tear film does the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">provides lubrication for the cornea and conjunctiva</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">facilitates the exchange of solutes, including oxygen</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">contributes to the antimicrobial defense of the ocular surface</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">serves as a medium to remove debris</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Further, the air–&#173;tear film interface at the surface of the cornea constitutes a major refractive ele&#173;ment of the eye, &#173;because of the difference in the refractive index of air and that of the tear film. Aberrations in the tear film result from a variety of diseases (eg, dry eye, blepharitis) that can profoundly affect the integrity of the ocular surface and consequently the patient’s vision. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7</span> for in-&#173;depth discussion of the tear film.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Cornea</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cornea is a clear avascular tissue consisting of 5 layers (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-2</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">epithelium</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Bowman layer</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">stroma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Descemet membrane</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">endothelium</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cornea covers one-&#173;sixth of the surface of the globe. It has a refractive index of 1.376 and an average radius of curvature of 7.8&#160;mm. With a power of 43.25 diopters (D), the cornea produces most of the eye’s refractive power of 58.60 D. Oxygen from the air and from the eyelid vasculature dissolves in tears and is transmitted to the cornea via the tear film. The cornea derives its macromolecules and nutrients from the aqueous humor.</p>
			<p class="h2">Characteristics of the Central and Peripheral Cornea</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In adults, the cornea mea&#173;sures about 12&#160;mm in the horizontal meridian and about 11&#160;mm in the vertical meridian. The central third of the cornea is nearly spherical and mea&#173;sures approximately 4&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter. &#173;Because the posterior surface of the cornea is more curved than the anterior surface, the central cornea is thinner (0.5&#160;mm) than the peripheral cornea (1.0&#160;mm). The cornea flattens in the periphery, with more extensive flattening nasally and superiorly than temporally and inferiorly. This topography is impor&#173;tant in contact lens fitting. For additional discussion, see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span>&#160;in BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> and Chapter&#160;4&#160;in Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Epithelium and Basal Lamina</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The anterior surface of the cornea is covered by a lipophilic, nonkeratinized, stratified squamous epithelium that is composed of 4–6 cell layers and is typically 40–50 <span class="greek">μ</span>m thick (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-3</span>). The basal cells have a width of 12 <span class="greek">μ</span>m and a density of approximately 6000 cells/mm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>. They are attached to the under&#173;lying basal lamina by hemidesmosomes. Trauma to the epithelium disrupting this layer can lead to recurrent corneal erosion due to improper re-&#173;formation of &#173;these hemidesmosomes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Overlying the basal cell layer are 2 or 3 layers of polygonal “wing” cells. Superficial to &#173;these layers are 1–2 layers of corneal epithelial “surface” cells that are extremely thin (30&#160;<span class="greek">μ</span>m) and are attached to one another by tight junctions. The tight junctions allow the surface epithelial cells to act as a barrier to diffusion. Microvilli make the apical membranes of the surface cells highly irregular; however, the precorneal tear film renders the surfaces optically smooth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the deeper epithelial cells are firmly attached to one another by desmosomes, they migrate continuously from the basal region &#173;toward the tear film, into which they are shed. They also migrate centripetally from their stem cell source at the limbus. Division of the slow-&#173;cycling stem cells gives rise to a progeny of &#173;daughter cells (transient amplifying cells), whose division serves to maintain the corneal epithelium (see also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>). Diffuse damage to the limbal stem cells (eg, by chemical burns or trachoma) leads to chronic epithelial surface defects.</p>

			<p class="h2">Bowman Layer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Beneath the basal lamina of the epithelium is the <span class="italic">Bowman layer,</span> or <span class="italic">Bowman membrane,</span> a tough layer consisting of randomly dispersed collagen fibrils. It is a modified region of the anterior stroma that is 8–15 <span class="greek">μ</span>m thick (see Fig 2-2). Unlike the Descemet membrane, it is not restored &#173;after injury but is replaced by scar tissue.</p>
			<p class="h2">Stroma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The stroma constitutes approximately 90% of the total corneal thickness in &#173;humans (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig 2-2</span>). It is composed of collagen-&#173;producing keratocytes, ground substance, and collagen lamellae. The collagen fibrils form obliquely oriented lamellae in the anterior third of the stroma (with some interlacing) and perpendicular lamellae in the less &#173;compact posterior two-&#173;thirds (see Chapter 8, Fig 8-3).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The corneal collagen fibrils extend across the entire dia&#173;meter of the cornea, fi&#173;nally winding circumferentially around the limbus. The fibrils are remarkably uniform in size and separation, and this regularity helps determine the transparency of the cornea (see also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>). Separation of the collagen fibrils by edema leads to stromal clouding. The stroma’s collagen types are I (predominant), III, IV, V, VI, XII, and XIV. Type VII forms the anchoring fibril of the epithelium. Natu&#173;ral crosslinking occurs with aging.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ground substance of the cornea consists of proteoglycans that run along and between the collagen fibrils. Their glycosaminoglycan components (eg, keratan sulfate) are negatively charged and tend to repel each other—as well as draw in sodium and, secondarily, &#173;water<span class="bold">—&#173;</span>producing the swelling pressure of the stroma. The keratocytes lie between the corneal lamellae and synthesize both collagen and proteoglycans. Ultrastructurally, they resemble fibrocytes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cornea has approximately 2.4 million keratocytes, which occupy about 5% of the stromal volume; the density is higher anteriorly (1058 cells/mm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>) than posteriorly (771 cells/mm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>). Keratocytes are highly active cells rich in mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticula, and Golgi apparatus. They have attachment structures, communicate through gap junctions, and have unusual fenestrations in their plasma membranes. Their flat profile and even distribution in the coronal plane ensure a minimum disturbance of light transmission.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Descemet Membrane</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The basal lamina of the corneal endothelium, the <span class="italic">Descemet membrane,</span> is periodic acid–&#173;Schiff (PAS) positive (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-4</span>). It is a true basement membrane, and its thickness increases with age. At birth, the Descemet membrane is 3–4 <span class="greek">μ</span>m thick, increasing to 10–12 <span class="greek">μ</span>m at adulthood. It is composed of an anterior banded zone that develops in utero (4.6 <span class="symbol">±</span> 0.4 <span class="greek">μ</span>m thick) and a posterior nonbanded zone that is laid down by the corneal endothelium throughout life (average in adults is 11.8 <span class="symbol">±</span> 0.4 <span class="greek">μ</span>m, increasing about 0.1 <span class="greek">μ</span>m/year) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-5</span>). &#173;These zones provide a historical rec&#173;ord of the synthetic function of the endothelium. Like other basal laminae, the Descemet membrane is rich in type IV collagen.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Peripheral excrescences of the Descemet membrane, known as <span class="italic">Hassall-&#173;Henle warts,</span> are common, especially among el&#173;derly &#173;people. Central excrescences (corneal guttae) also appear with increasing age.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Endothelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The corneal endothelium is composed of a single layer of hexagonal cells derived from the neural crest (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-6</span>). Therefore, the corneal endothelium is of neuroectodermal origin. In young adult eyes, approximately 500,000 cells are pres&#173;ent, at a density of about 3000/mm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span> centrally and up to 8000/mm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span> peripherally. Mitosis of the endothelium is limited in &#173;humans, and the overall number of endothelial cells decreases with age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The size, shape, and distribution of the endothelial cells can be observed by specular microscopy at the slit lamp. The apical surfaces of &#173;these cells face the anterior chamber; their basal surfaces secrete the Descemet membrane. Typically, young endothelial cells have large nuclei and abundant mitochondria. The active transport of ions by &#173;these cells leads to the transfer of &#173;water from the corneal stroma and the maintenance of stromal deturgescence and transparency.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Endothelial cell dysfunction and loss—&#173;through surgical injury, inflammation, or disease (eg, Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy)—&#173;may cause endothelial decompensation, stromal edema, and vision loss. &#173;Because endothelial mitosis is limited in &#173;humans, destruction of cells &#173;causes cell density to decrease and residual cells to spread and enlarge.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Limbus</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The transition zone between the peripheral cornea and the anterior sclera, known as the <span class="italic">limbus</span> (also called <a href="https://www.dorlands.com/dorlands/def.jsp?id=100055734"><span class="Hyperlink_italic">corneoscleral</span></a> <a href="https://www.dorlands.com/dorlands/def.jsp?id=100055756"><span class="Hyperlink_italic">junction</span></a> or <span class="italic">corneal limbus</span>), is defined differently by anatomists, pathologists, and clinicians. Though not a distinct anatomical structure, the limbus is impor&#173;tant for 3 reasons: its relationship to the anterior chamber &#173;angle, its use as a surgical landmark, and its supply of corneal stem cells. The limbus is also the site of passage of the collector channel that links the Schlemm canal to aqueous veins.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following structures are found at the limbus:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-7">conjunctiva and limbal palisades of Vogt, which &#173;house the corneal stem cells</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">episclera (discussed &#173;later, &#173;under Sclera)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">junction of corneoscleral stroma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-8">aqueous outflow apparatus (collector channel)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The corneoscleral junction begins centrally in a plane connecting the end of the Bowman layer and the Schwalbe line, which is the termination of the Descemet membrane. Internally, its posterior limit is the anterior tip of the scleral spur (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-7</span>). Pathologists consider the posterior limit of the limbus to be formed by another plane perpendicular to the surface of the eye, approximately 1.5&#160;mm posterior to the termination of the Bowman layer in the horizontal meridian and 2.0&#160;mm posterior in the vertical meridian, where &#173;there is greater scleral overlap (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgical limbus, an external landmark for incisions in cataract and glaucoma surgery, is sometimes referred to as the <span class="italic">gray</span> or <span class="italic">blue zone.</span> Its blue-&#173;gray appearance is due to the scattering of light through the oblique interface between cornea and sclera, which occurs gradually over 1–2&#160;mm (see Fig 2-8B). The posterior border of the blue-&#173;gray zone is a consistent external landmark that corresponds to the internal junction of cornea and sclera overlying the trabecular meshwork in all meridians.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Sclera</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The sclera covers the posterior five-&#173;sixths of the surface of the globe, with an anterior opening for the cornea and a posterior opening for the optic nerve. The tendons of the rectus muscles insert into the superficial scleral collagen. The Tenon capsule covers the sclera and rectus muscles anteriorly, and both are overlain by the bulbar conjunctiva. The capsule and conjunctiva fuse near the limbus.</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-10">The sclera is thinnest (0.3&#160;mm) just &#173;behind the insertions of the rectus muscles and thickest (1.0&#160;mm) at the posterior pole around the optic nerve head. It is 0.4–0.5&#160;mm thick at the equator and 0.6&#160;mm thick anterior to the muscle insertions. &#173;Because of the thinness of the sclera, strabismus and ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment surgery require careful placement of sutures.</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-13"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="Operator_BCSC2019_S02_C02_p047_104_4P-web-resources/image/1.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text">The sclera, like the cornea, is essentially avascular except for the vessels of the intrascleral vascular plexus, located just posterior to the limbus, and the episcleral vessels. The episcleral vessels have superficial and deep plexuses (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-9</span>). The superficial plexus runs beneath the Tenon capsule in a radial pattern; in episcleritis, it is this vascular plexus that is involved. The deep episcleral plexus rests on the surface of the sclera and is the layer involved in scleritis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Numerous channels, or <span class="italic">emissaria,</span> penetrate the sclera (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>, Figs 1-19, 1-20), allowing the passage of arteries, veins, and nerves:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">anterior emissaria: penetration of the anterior ciliary arteries anterior to the rectus muscle insertions</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;middle emissaria: exit of vortex veins</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">posterior emissaria: lamina cribrosa, penetration of the short and long posterior ciliary vessels and ciliary nerves</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Extraocular extension of malignant melanoma of the choroid occurs by way of the &#173;middle emissaria.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Branches of the ciliary nerves that supply the cornea sometimes leave the sclera to form loops posterior to the nasal and temporal limbus. &#173;These nerve loops, called <span class="italic">Axenfeld loops,</span> are sometimes pigmented and, consequently, have been mistaken for uveal tissue or malignant melanoma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-10</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anterior to the rectus muscle insertions, the episclera consists of a dense vascular connective tissue that merges deeply with the superficial sclera and superficially with the Tenon capsule and the conjunctiva. The scleral stroma is composed of bundles of collagen, fibroblasts, and a moderate amount of ground substance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Collagen fibers of the sclera vary in size and shape and taper at their ends, indicating that they are not continuous fibers as in the cornea. The inner layer of the sclera <span class="italic">(lamina fusca)</span> blends imperceptibly with the suprachoroidal and supraciliary lamellae of the uvea. The collagen fibers in this portion of the sclera branch and intermingle with the outer ciliary body and choroid. The opaque, porcelain-&#173;white appearance of the sclera contrasts markedly with the transparency of the cornea and is primarily due to 2 &#173;factors: the greater variation in collagen fibril separation and dia&#173;meter, and the greater degree of fibril interweaving in the sclera (see also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>). In addition, the lack of vascular ele&#173;ments contributes to corneal clarity.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Anterior Chamber</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The anterior chamber is bordered anteriorly by the cornea and posteriorly by the iris diaphragm and the pupil. The <span class="italic">anterior chamber &#173;angle,</span> which lies at the junction of the cornea and the iris, includes the following 5 structures (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 2-11 through 2-14</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Schwalbe line</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Schlemm canal and trabecular meshwork (also see the section Trabecular Mesh&#173;work)</li>

				<li class="bullet-list-mid">anterior border of the ciliary body (where its longitudinal fibers insert into the scleral spur)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">peripheral iris</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The depth of the anterior chamber averages 3.0&#160;mm but is deeper in aphakia, pseudophakia, and myopia and shallower in hyperopia. In the normal adult eye, the anterior chamber is deepest centrally and reaches its narrowest point slightly central to the &#173;angle recess.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The anterior chamber is filled with <span class="italic">aqueous humor,</span> which is produced by the ciliary epithelium in the posterior chamber. The fluid passes through the pupil aperture and drains by the trabecular pathway (ie, through the trabecular meshwork into the Schlemm canal) and the uveoscleral pathway (ie, the root of the iris and the ciliary body face, into the suprachoroidal space). The uveoscleral pathway, thought to be influenced by age, accounts for up to 50% of aqueous outflow in young &#173;people. BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> discusses the anterior chamber and aqueous humor in detail. High-&#173;resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy provides detailed 2-&#173;dimensional views of the anterior segment of the eye and is performed in vivo (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-12</span>), allowing the clinician to view the relationship of the structures in the anterior segment &#173;under dif&#173;fer&#173;ent pathologic conditions (Video 2-1).</p>

			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-15">The internal scleral sulcus accommodates the Schlemm canal externally and the trabecular meshwork internally. The Schwalbe line, the peripheral limit of the Descemet membrane, forms the anterior margin of the sulcus; the scleral spur is its posterior landmark. The scleral spur receives the insertion of the longitudinal ciliary muscle, contraction of which opens up the trabecular spaces.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Myofibroblast-&#173;like scleral spur cells with contractile properties are disposed circumferentially within the scleral spur. They resemble mechanoreceptors, receive sensory innervation, and are connected by elastic tissue to the trabecular meshwork. In experiments, stimulation with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) or calcitonin gene–&#173;related peptide (CGRP) &#173;causes an increase in outflow fa&#173;cil&#173;i&#173;ty. Individual scleral spur cells are innervated by unmyelinated axons, the terminals of which contact the cell membranes of the spur cells without an intervening basal lamina. The nerve fibers in this region are immunoreactive for neuropeptide Y, substance P, CGRP, VIP, and nitrous oxide; therefore, they are mediated by sympathetic, sensory, and pterygopalatine nerve pathways. &#173;There are no cholinergic fibers in this region.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Myelinated nerve fibers extending forward from the ciliary region to the inner aspect of the scleral spur yield branches to the meshwork and to club-&#173;shaped endings in the scleral spur. &#173;These endings have the morphologic features of mechanoreceptors found elsewhere in the body, such as in the carotid artery. The endings are incompletely covered by a Schwann cell sheath and make contact with extracellular matrix materials such as elastin. Vari&#173;ous functions have been proposed for &#173;these endings, including proprioception to the ciliary muscle, which inserts into the scleral spur; signaling contraction of the scleral spur cells; and baroreception in response to changes in intraocular pressure.</p>

			<p class="h1">Trabecular Meshwork</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top9">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The relationship of the trabecular meshwork and the Schlemm canal to other structures is complex &#173;because the outflow apparatus is composed of tissue derived from the cornea, sclera, iris, and ciliary body (<span class="xref-figure-local">see Figs 2-11, 2-13</span>). The trabecular meshwork is a circular spongework of connective tissue lined by trabeculocytes. &#173;These cells have contractile properties, which may influence outflow re&#173;sis&#173;tance. They also have phagocytic properties. The meshwork is roughly triangular in cross section; the apex is at the Schwalbe line, and the base is formed by the scleral spur and the ciliary body.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The trabecular meshwork can be divided into 3 layers (see Fig 2-13):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">uveal trabecular meshwork</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">corneoscleral meshwork</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">juxtacanalicular meshwork, which is directly adjacent to the Schlemm canal</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The uveal portion and the corneoscleral meshwork can be divided by an imaginary line drawn from the Schwalbe line to the scleral spur. The uveal meshwork lies internal and the corneoscleral meshwork external to this line.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aging changes to the trabecular meshwork include increased pigmentation, decreased number of trabecular cells, and thickening of the basement membrane beneath the trabecular cells. Trabecular sheets thicken two- to threefold. Endothelial cellularity is lost, connective tissue increases, debris accumulates in the meshwork, and glycosaminoglycans accumulate in the extracellular space. &#173;These changes can increase re&#173;sis&#173;tance to aqueous outflow. Such changes are exaggerated in chronic open-&#173;angle glaucoma. This subject is covered in greater depth in BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Uveal Trabecular Meshwork</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The uveal meshwork &#173;faces the anterior chamber. It is composed of cordlike trabeculae and has fewer elastic fibers than does the corneoscleral meshwork. The trabeculocytes usually contain pigment granules. The trabecular apertures are less circular and larger than &#173;those of the corneoscleral meshwork.</p>
			<p class="h2">Corneoscleral Meshwork</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The corneoscleral meshwork consists of a series of thin, flat, perforated connective tissue sheets arranged in a laminar pattern. Each trabecular beam is covered by a monolayer of thin trabecular cells exhibiting multiple pinocytotic vesicles. The basal lamina of &#173;these cells forms the outer cortex of the trabecular beam; the inner core is composed of collagen and elastic fibers.</p>
			<p class="h2">Juxtacanalicular Meshwork</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The juxtacanalicular meshwork invests the entire extent of the Schlemm canal and forms its inner wall. On its trabecular aspect, between the outermost layers of the corneoscleral meshwork and the endothelial lining of the Schlemm canal, lies the <span class="italic">endothelial meshwork,</span> a multilayered collection of cells forming a loose network. Between &#173;these cells are spaces up to 10 <span class="greek">μ</span>m wide through which aqueous humor can percolate to reach the endothelial lining of the Schlemm canal (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-15</span>). This region of the drainage system contributes the most to outflow re&#173;sis&#173;tance, partly &#173;because the pathway is narrow and tortuous and partly &#173;because of the re&#173;sis&#173;tance offered by extracellular proteoglycans and glycoproteins.</p>
			<p class="h2">Schlemm Canal</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Schlemm canal is a circular tube that closely resembles a lymphatic vessel. It is formed by a continuous monolayer of nonfenestrated endothelium and a thin connective tissue wall. The basement membrane of the endothelium is poorly defined. The lateral walls of the endothelial cells are joined by tight junctions. Micropinocytotic vesicles are pres&#173;ent at the apical and basal surfaces of the cells. Larger vesicles (so-&#173;called &#173;giant vacuoles) have been observed along the internal canal wall (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-16</span>). &#173;These vacuoles are lined by a single membrane, and their size and number are increased by a rise in intraocular pressure. They are thought to contribute to the pressure-&#173;dependent outflow of the aqueous humor. In one form of microinvasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS), a microstent is implanted in the Schlemm canal to bypass the trabecular meshwork, the point of greatest outflow re&#173;sis&#173;tance, thereby increasing aqueous outflow.</p>
			<p class="h2">Collector Channels</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 25–30 collector channels arise from the Schlemm canal (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-17</span>) and drain into the deep and midscleral venous plexuses. Up to 8 of &#173;these channels drain directly into the episcleral venous plexus as aqueous veins (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-18</span>), which are vis&#173;i&#173;ble in the conjunctiva by biomicroscopy.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Uvea</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top10">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The uvea (also called <span class="italic">uveal tract</span>) is the main vascular layer of the eye. It consists of 3 parts (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-19</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">iris</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ciliary body (located in the anterior uvea)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">choroid (located in the posterior uvea)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;These structures are discussed separately in the next 3 sections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The uvea is firmly attached to the sclera at only 3 sites:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">scleral spur</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">exit points of the vortex veins</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">optic nerve</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;These attachments account for the characteristic anterior dome-&#173;shaped choroidal detachment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The classification of uveitis, established by the 2005 SUN (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature) Working Group anatomical classification system, is based on the primary site of inflammation within the zones of the uvea:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-16">anterior: anterior chamber</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-16">intermediate: vitreous</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-16">posterior: choroid (primary or secondary from the ret&#173;ina)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-16">panuveitis: anterior chamber, vitreous, and ret&#173;ina or choroid</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Uveitis is discussed extensively in BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation.</span></p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Iris</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top11">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The iris is the most anterior extension of the uvea (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 2-20, 2-21).</span> It is made up of blood vessels and connective tissue, in addition to the melanocytes and pigment cells responsible for its distinctive color. The mobility of the iris allows the pupil to change size. During mydriasis, the iris is pulled into numerous ridges and folds; during miosis, its anterior surface is smoother.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The major structures of the iris are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">stroma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">vessels and nerves</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">dilator muscle and anterior pigmented epithelium</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">sphincter muscle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">posterior pigmented epithelium</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Stroma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The iris stroma is composed of pigmented cells (melanocytes), nonpigmented cells, collagen fibers, and a matrix containing hyaluronic acid. The aqueous humor flows freely within the loose stroma along the anterior border of the iris, which contains multiple crypts and crevices that vary in size, shape, and depth. This surface is covered by an interrupted layer of connective tissue cells that merges with the ciliary body.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The overall structure of the iris stroma is similar in irides of all colors. Differences in color are related to the amount of pigmentation in the anterior border layer and the deep stroma. The stroma of blue irides is lightly pigmented, and brown irides have a densely pigmented stroma.</p>
			<p class="h2">Vessels and Nerves</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blood vessels form the bulk of the iris stroma. Most follow a radial course, arising from the major arterial circle and passing to the center of the pupil. In the region of the <span class="italic">collarette</span> (the thickest portion of the iris), anastomoses occur between the arterial and venous arcades to form the minor vascular circle of the iris, which is often incomplete. The major arterial circle is located at the apex of the ciliary body, not the iris (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>, Fig 1-20).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The dia&#173;meter of the capillaries is relatively large. Their endothelium is nonfenestrated and is surrounded by a basement membrane, associated pericytes, and a zone of collagenous filaments. The intima has no internal elastic lamina. Myelinated and un&#173;myelinated nerve fibers serve sensory, vasomotor, and muscular functions throughout the stroma.</p>
			<p class="h2">Dilator Muscle and Anterior Pigmented Epithelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The dilator muscle develops from the anterior pigmented epithelium and is derived from the neuroectoderm. It lies parallel and anterior to the posterior pigmented epithelium (Fig 2-22; see Fig 2-20). The smooth muscle cells contain fine myofilaments and melanosomes. The myofibrils are confined mainly to the basal portion of the cells and extend anteriorly into the iris stroma. The melanosomes and the nucleus are found in the apical region of each myoepithelial cell. The remaining anterior pigmented epithelium is smaller and less pigmented than its posterior counterpart, making it difficult to visualize even on histologic sections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There is dual sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. The dilator muscle contracts in response to sympathetic <span class="greek">α</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-&#173;adrenergic stimulation; cholinergic parasympathetic stimulation may have an inhibitory role. See BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for additional discussion of physiology and pathology of the dilator muscle.</p>
			<p class="h2">Sphincter Muscle</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Like the dilator muscle, the sphincter muscle is derived from neuroectoderm. It is composed of a circular band of smooth muscle fibers and is located near the pupillary margin in the deep stroma, anterior to the posterior pigmented epithelium of the iris (see Fig 2-20). The sphincter muscle receives its primary innervation from parasympathetic nerve fibers that originate in the Edinger-&#173;Westphal nucleus and travel with the oculomotor nerve, and it responds pharmacologically to muscarinic stimulation. The reciprocal sympathetic innervation to the sphincter appears to serve an inhibitory role, helping relax the sphincter in darkness. See BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for additional discussion of physiology and pathology of the sphincter muscle.</p>
			<p class="h2">Posterior Pigmented Epithelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The posterior pigmented epithelium of the iris, also called <span class="italic">iris pigment epithelium (IPE),</span> is densely pigmented and appears velvety smooth and uniform. It is continuous with the nonpigmented epithelium of the ciliary body and thence with the neurosensory portion of the ret&#173;ina. The polarity of its cells is maintained from embryogenesis. The basal surface of the pigmented layer borders the posterior chamber. The apical surface &#173;faces the stroma and adheres to the anterior iris epithelium (see Fig 2-22).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The posterior pigmented epithelium of the iris curves around the pupillary margin and extends for a short distance onto the anterior border layer of the iris stroma as the pigment ruff. In rubeosis iridis, the pigmented epithelium extends farther onto the anterior surface of the iris, a condition called <span class="italic">ectropion.</span> The term <span class="italic">ectropion uveae,</span> which refers to an outfolding over the pupil of the IPE, is a misnomer &#173;because the IPE is derived from neuroectoderm (not neural crest) and therefore is not considered part of the uvea.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-17">Ciliary Body</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top12">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ciliary body, which is triangular in cross section, bridges the anterior and posterior segments of the eye (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig 2-14</span>). The apex of the ciliary body is directed posteriorly &#173;toward the ora serrata. The base of the ciliary body gives rise to the iris. The only attachment of the ciliary body to the sclera is at its base, via its longitudinal muscle fibers, where they insert into the scleral spur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ciliary body has 2 principal functions: aqueous humor formation and lens accommodation. It also plays a role in the trabecular and uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ciliary Epithelium and Stroma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ciliary body is 6–7&#160;mm wide and consists of 2 parts: the pars plana and the pars plicata. The <span class="italic">pars plana</span> is a relatively avascular, smooth, pigmented zone that is 4&#160;mm wide and extends from the ora serrata to the ciliary pro&#173;cesses. The safest posterior surgical approach to the vitreous cavity is through the pars plana, located 3–4&#160;mm from the corneal limbus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">pars plicata</span> is richly vascularized and consists of approximately 70 radial folds, or <span class="italic">ciliary pro&#173;cesses.</span> The zonular fibers of the lens attach primarily in the valleys of the ciliary pro&#173;cesses but also along the pars plana (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Figs 2-21, 2-47</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The capillary plexus of each ciliary pro&#173;cess is supplied by arterioles as they pass anteriorly and posteriorly from the major arterial circle; each plexus is drained by 1 or 2 large venules at the crest of each pro&#173;cess. Sphincter tone within the arteriolar smooth muscle affects the capillary hydrostatic pressure gradient. In addition, sphincter tone influences &#173;whether blood flows into the capillary plexus or directly to the draining choroidal vein, bypassing the plexus completely. Neuronal innervation of the vascular smooth muscle and humoral vasoactive substances may be impor&#173;tant in determining regional blood flow, capillary surface area available for exchange of fluid, and hydrostatic capillary pressure. All of &#173;these &#173;factors affect the rate of aqueous humor formation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ciliary body is lined by a double layer of epithelial cells: the inner, nonpigmented ciliary epithelium and the outer, pigmented ciliary epithelium (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-23</span>). The basal lamina of the nonpigmented epithelium &#173;faces the posterior chamber, and the basal lamina of the outer pigmented epithelium is attached to the ciliary stroma and blood vessels. The nonpigmented and pigmented cell layers are oriented apex to apex and are fused by a complex system of junctions and cellular interdigitations. Along the lateral intercellular spaces, near the apical border of the nonpigmented epithelium, are tight junctions (zonulae occludentes) that maintain the blood–&#173;aqueous barrier. The basal lamina of the pigmented epithelium is thick and more homogeneous than that of the nonpigmented epithelium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The pigmented epithelium is relatively uniform throughout the ciliary body. Each of its cuboidal cells has multiple basal infoldings, a large nucleus, mitochondria, an extensive endoplasmic reticulum, and many melanosomes. The nonpigmented epithelium tends to be cuboidal in the pars plana but columnar in the pars plicata. It also has multiple basal infoldings, abundant mitochondria, and large nuclei. The endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complexes in &#173;these cells are impor&#173;tant for aqueous humor formation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The uveal portion of the ciliary body, the stroma, consists of comparatively large fenestrated capillaries, collagen fibers, and fibroblasts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The main arterial supply to the ciliary body comes from the anterior and long posterior ciliary arteries, which join to form a multilayered arterial plexus consisting of a superficial episcleral plexus; a deeper intramuscular plexus; and an incomplete major arterial circle often mistakenly attributed to the iris but actually located posterior to the anterior chamber &#173;angle recess, in the ciliary body (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>, Figs 1-19, 1-20, 1-22). The major veins drain posteriorly through the vortex system, although some drainage also occurs through the intrascleral venous plexus and the episcleral veins into the limbal region.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ciliary Muscle</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The 3 layers of fibers in the ciliary muscle (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-24</span>) are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">longitudinal</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">radial</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">circular</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most of the ciliary muscle is made up of the outer layer of longitudinal fibers that attach to the scleral spur. The radial muscle fibers arise in the midportion of the ciliary body, and the circular fibers are located in the innermost portion. Clinically, the 3 groups of muscle fibers function as a unit. Presbyopia is associated with age-&#173;related changes in the lens (discussed in the section Lens, &#173;later in this chapter) rather than in the ciliary muscle. Even so, the muscle does change with age: the amount of connective tissue between the muscle bundles increases, and &#173;there is a loss of elastic recoil &#173;after contraction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ciliary muscle fibers behave like other smooth, nonstriated muscle fibers. Ultrastructural studies reveal that they contain multiple myofibrils with characteristic electron-&#173;dense attachment bodies, mitochondria, glycogen particles, and a prominent nucleus. The anterior elastic tendons insert into the scleral spur and around the tips of the oblique and circular muscle fibers as they insert into the trabecular meshwork. Both myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers are observed throughout the ciliary muscle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Innervation is derived mainly from parasympathetic fibers of the third cranial nerve via the short ciliary nerves. Approximately 97% of &#173;these ciliary fibers are directed to the ciliary muscle, for accommodation, and about 3% are directed to the iris sphincter. Sympathetic fibers have also been observed and may play a role in relaxing the muscle. Cholinergic drugs contract the ciliary muscle. &#173;Because some of the muscle fibers form tendinous attachments to the scleral spur, their contraction increases aqueous flow by opening up the spaces of the trabecular meshwork.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-19">Supraciliary Space</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The supraciliary space is a potential space located below the sclera and above the choroid and ciliary body. This space can expand to accommodate fluid (as for the delivery of drugs) or microstents (as in minimally invasive glaucoma surgery [MIGS]).</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Choroid</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top13">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The choroid, the posterior portion of the uvea, nourishes the outer portion of the ret&#173;ina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-25</span>). It averages 0.25&#160;mm in thickness and consists of 3 layers of vessels:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-20">the choriocapillaris, the innermost layer</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">a &#173;middle layer of small vessels (Sattler layer)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-21">an outer layer of large vessels (Haller layer)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Perfusion of the choroid comes both from the long and short posterior ciliary arteries and from the perforating anterior ciliary arteries. Venous blood drains through the vortex system. Blood flow through the choroid is high compared with that through other tissues. As a result, the oxygen content of choroidal venous blood is only 2%–3% lower than that of arterial blood.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-19">Choriocapillaris and Choroidal Vessels</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The choriocapillaris is a continuous layer of large capillaries (40–60 <span class="greek">μ</span>m in dia&#173;meter) lying in a single plane beneath the RPE (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-26</span>). The vessel walls are extremely thin and contain multiple fenestrations, especially on the surface facing the ret&#173;ina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-27</span>). Pericytes are located along the outer wall.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The &#173;middle and outer layers of choroidal vessels are not fenestrated. The large vessels, typical of small arteries elsewhere, possess an internal elastic lamina and smooth muscle cells in the media. As a result, small molecules such as fluorescein, which diffuse across the endothelium of the choriocapillaris, do not leak through medium and large choroidal vessels.</p>
			<p class="h2">Choroidal Stroma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Abundant melanocytes, as well as occasional macrophages, lymphocytes, mast cells, and plasma cells, appear throughout the choroidal stroma. The intercellular space contains collagen fibers and nerve fibers. In lightly pigmented eyes, pigmentation in the choroid is sparse compared with that of darkly pigmented eyes.</p>

			<p class="h1">Lens</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top14">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens is a biconvex structure located directly &#173;behind the posterior chamber and pupil (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-28</span>). The lens contributes 20.00 D of the 60.00 D of focusing power of the average adult eye. The equatorial dia&#173;meter is 6.5&#160;mm at birth; it increases in the first 2–3 de&#173;cades of life and remains approximately 9–10&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter in adults. The anteroposterior width of the lens is approximately 3&#160;mm at birth and increases &#173;after the second de&#173;cade of life to approximately 6&#160;mm by age 80&#160;years. This growth is accompanied by a shortening of the anterior radius of curvature of the lens, which would increase its optical power if not for a compensatory change in the refractive gradient across the lens substance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In youth, accommodation for near vision is achieved by ciliary muscle contraction, which moves the ciliary muscle mass forward and inward. This contraction relaxes zonular tension and allows the lens to assume a globular shape, causing its anterior radius of curvature to shorten (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-29</span>). With age, accommodative power is steadily lost. At age 8&#160;years, the power is 14.00 D. By age 28&#160;years, the accommodative power decreases to approximately 9.00 D, and it decreases further to 1.00 D by age 64&#160;years. &#173;Causes of this power loss include the increased size of the lens, altered mechanical relationships, and the increased stiffness of the lens nucleus secondary to changes in the crystalline proteins of the fiber cytoplasm. Other &#173;factors, such as alterations in the geometry of zonular attachments with age and changes in lens capsule elasticity, may also play a role.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The lens lacks innervation and is avascular. &#173;After regression of the hyaloid vasculature during embryogenesis, the lens depends solely on the aqueous and vitreous for its nourishment. From embryonic life on, it is entirely enclosed by a basal lamina, the lens capsule. See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;11</span>, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract</span>.</p>
			<p class="h2">Capsule</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens capsule is a product of the lens epithelium (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-28</span>). It is rich in type IV collagen and other matrix proteins. Synthesis of the anterior lens capsule (which overlies the epithelium) continues throughout life so that its thickness increases. &#173;Because &#173;there are no lens epithelial cells posteriorly, the thickness of the posterior capsule remains constant. Values of 15.5 <span class="greek">μ</span>m for the thickness of the anterior capsule and 2.8 <span class="greek">μ</span>m for the posterior capsule have been cited for the adult lens, although &#173;these values may vary among individuals and based on the location within the capsule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Morphologically, the lens capsule consists of fine filaments arranged in lamellae, parallel to the surface (see Fig 2-29). The anterior lens capsule contains a fibrogranular material, identified as laminin, which is absent from the posterior capsule at the ultrastructural level. The thinness of the posterior capsule creates a potential for rupture during cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="h2">Epithelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens epithelium lies beneath the anterior and equatorial capsule but is absent &#173;under the posterior capsule (see Fig 2-28). The basal aspects of the cells abut the lens capsule without specialized attachment sites. The apices of the cells face the interior of the lens, and the lateral borders interdigitate, with practically no intercellular space. Each cell contains a prominent nucleus but relatively few cytoplasmic organelles.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Regional differences in the lens epithelium are impor&#173;tant. The central zone represents a stable population of cells whose numbers slowly decline with age. An intermediate zone of smaller cells shows occasional mitoses. Peripherally in the equatorial lens bow area, &#173;there are meridional rows of cuboidal preequatorial cells that form the <span class="italic">germinative zone</span> of the lens (see Figs 2-28, 2-29). &#173;Here, cells undergo mitotic division, elongate anteriorly and posteriorly, and form the differentiated fiber cells of the lens. In the &#173;human lens, cell division continues throughout life and is responsible for the continued growth of the lens.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-24">Fibers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As new lens fibers form, they compact previously formed fibers, with the older layers &#173;toward the center, surrounding the central embryonic and fetal nuclei formed during embryonic development (see Fig 2-29). &#173;There is no definite morphologic distinction, but rather a gradual transition between the nucleus and cortex of the lens. The terms <span class="italic">endonucleus, nucleus, epinucleus,</span> and <span class="italic">cortex</span> refer to potential differences in appearance and be&#173;hav&#173;ior of the layers during surgical procedures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In optical section with the slit lamp, lamellar zones of discontinuity are vis&#173;i&#173;ble in the cortex. The fiber cells are hexagonal in cross section; have a spindle shape; and possess numerous interlocking, fingerlike projections. Apart from the most superficial cortical fibers, the cytoplasm is homogeneous and contains few organelles. The high refractive index of the lens results from the high concentration of lens crystallins (<span class="greek">α</span>, <span class="greek">β</span>, and <span class="greek">γ</span>) in the fiber cytoplasm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lens sutures are formed by the interdigitation of the anterior and posterior tips of the spindle-&#173;shaped fibers. In the fetal lens, this interdigitation forms the anterior Y-&#173;shaped suture and the posterior inverted Y–&#173;shaped suture. As the lens ages, further branches are added to the sutures; each new set of branch points corresponds to the appearance of a fresh optical zone of discontinuity.</p>
			<p class="h2">Zonular Fibers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens is held in place by the system of zonular fibers <span class="italic">(zonule, suspensory ligament)</span> that originate from the basal laminae of the nonpigmented epithelium of the pars plana and pars plicata of the ciliary body. &#173;These fibers attach chiefly to the lens capsule anterior and posterior to the equator (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-30</span>). Each zonular fiber is made up of multiple filaments of fibrillin that merge with the equatorial lens capsule. In Marfan syndrome, mutations in the fibrillin gene lead to weakening of the zonular fibers and subluxation of the lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-25">When the eye is focused for distance, the zonule is &#173;under tension and the lens form is relatively flattened. During accommodation, contraction of the ciliary muscle moves the proximal attachment of the zonule forward and inward, so the lens becomes more globular and the eye adjusts for near vision (<span class="xref-figure-local">Video 2-2</span>).</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">fundus oculi</span> is the part of the eye that is vis&#173;i&#173;ble with ophthalmoscopy; it includes the ret&#173;ina, its vessels, and the optic nerve (the anterior surface of which is vis&#173;i&#173;ble ophthalmoscopically as the <span class="italic">optic disc</span>). The reddish color of the fundus is due to the transmission of light reflected from the posterior sclera through the capillary bed of the choroid. The <span class="italic">macula</span> lies between the temporal vascular arcades. At the macula’s center lies the <span class="italic">fovea</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-31</span>)<span class="italic">,</span> which contains a specialized region in its center known as the <span class="italic">foveola</span>. The macula and fovea are discussed in greater detail &#173;later in the chapter. In the far periphery, the <span class="italic">ora serrata,</span> the junction between the ret&#173;ina and the pars plana, can be observed with gonioscopy or indirect ophthalmoscopy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Embryologically, the ret&#173;ina and its under&#173;lying epithelial layer have a common origin, the optic vesicle (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span>). Thus, the ret&#173;ina can be described as having 2 parts: (1) the neurosensory ret&#173;ina, containing the photoreceptors, neurons, and other ele&#173;ments; and (2) the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE).</p>
			<p class="h2">Neurosensory Ret&#173;ina</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">neurosensory ret&#173;i&#173;na</span> is a thin, transparent structure that develops from the inner layer of the optic cup. The neurosensory ret&#173;ina is composed of neuronal, glial, and vascular ele&#173;ments (see <span class="xref-figure">Figs 2-33, 2-34)</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In cross section, from inner to outer ret&#173;ina, the layers of the neurosensory ret&#173;ina are as follows (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-32</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">internal limiting membrane</li>

				<li class="bullet-list-mid">rod and cone inner segments</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">rod and cone outer segments</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;These layers are discussed &#173;later in the chapter, in the section “Stratification of the neurosensory ret&#173;ina.” The ret&#173;ina is discussed in depth in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous.</span></p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Neuronal ele&#173;ments</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The photoreceptor layer of the neurosensory ret&#173;ina consists of highly specialized neuroepithelial cells called <span class="italic">rods</span> and <span class="italic">cones.</span> &#173;There are approximately 100–125 million rods and 6–7 million cones in the &#173;human ret&#173;ina, an approximate ratio of 20:1. Each photoreceptor cell consists of an outer segment and an inner segment. The outer segments, surrounded by a mucopolysaccharide matrix, make contact with the apical pro&#173;cesses of the RPE. Tight junctions or other intercellular connections do not exist between the photoreceptor cell outer segments and the RPE. The &#173;factors responsible for keeping &#173;these layers in apposition are poorly understood but prob&#173;ably involve active transport and other mechanisms, including van der Waals forces, oncotic pressure, and electrostatic forces.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The rod photoreceptor consists of an outer segment that contains multiple laminated discs resembling a stack of coins and a central connecting cilium (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-33</span>). The microtubules of the cilium have a 9-&#173;plus-0 cross-&#173;sectional configuration rather than the 9-&#173;plus-2 configuration found in motile cilia. The rod inner segment is subdivided into 2 additional ele&#173;ments: an outer ellipsoid containing numerous mitochondria, and an inner myoid containing a large amount of glycogen; the myoid is continuous with the main cell body, where the nucleus is located. The inner portion of the cell contains the <span class="italic">synaptic body,</span> or <span class="italic">spherule,</span> of the rod, which is formed by a single invagination that accommodates 2 horizontal-&#173;cell pro&#173;cesses and 1 or more central bipolar dendrites (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-34</span>). The outer segments of the cones have a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent morphology depending on their location in the ret&#173;ina.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The extrafoveal cone photoreceptors of the ret&#173;ina have conical ellipsoids and myoids, and their nuclei tend to be closer to the external limiting membrane than are the nuclei of the rods. Although the structure of the outer segments of the rods and cones is similar, at least 1 impor&#173;tant difference exists. Rod discs are not attached to the cell membrane; they are discrete structures. Cone discs are attached to the cell membrane and are thought to be renewed by membranous replacement (see Fig 2-33).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cone <span class="italic">synaptic body,</span> or <span class="italic">pedicle,</span> is more complex than the rod spherule. Cone pedicles synapse with other rods and cones as well as with horizontal and bipolar cell pro&#173;cesses (see Fig 2-34). Foveal cones have cylindrical inner segments similar to rods but other&#173;wise are cytologically identical to extrafoveal cones.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Horizontal cells</span> make synaptic connections with many rod spherules and cone pedicles; they also extend cell pro&#173;cesses horizontally throughout the outer plexiform layer. <span class="italic">Bipolar cells</span> are oriented vertically. Their dendrites synapse with rod or cone synaptic bodies, and their axons make synaptic contact with ganglion cells and amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The axons of the ganglion cells bend to become parallel to the inner surface of the ret&#173;ina, where they form the nerve fiber layer and &#173;later the axons of the optic nerve. Each optic nerve has more than 1 million nerve fibers. The nerve fibers from the temporal ret&#173;ina follow an arcuate course around the macula to enter the superior and inferior poles of the optic nerve head. The papillomacular fibers travel straight to the optic nerve from the fovea. The nasal axons also pursue a radial course. The visibility of the nerve fibers is enhanced when they are viewed ophthalmoscopically using green (red-&#173;free) illumination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The neuronal ele&#173;ments and their connections in the ret&#173;ina are highly complex (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-35</span>). Many types of bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells exist. The neuronal ele&#173;ments of 100–125 million rods and 6–7 million cones are interconnected, and signal pro&#173;cessing within the neurosensory ret&#173;ina is significant.</p>
			<p class="h3">Glial ele&#173;ments</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells are glial cells that extend vertically from the external limiting membrane inward to the internal limiting membrane (see Fig 2-35). Their nuclei are located in the inner nuclear layer. M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells, along with the other glial ele&#173;ments (the fibrous and protoplasmic astrocytes and microglia), provide structural support and nutrition to the ret&#173;ina and are crucial to normal physiology. In addition, they contribute to the inner blood–&#173;retina barrier.</p>
			<p class="h3">Vascular ele&#173;ments</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ret&#173;ina is a highly metabolic structure, with the highest rate of oxygen consumption per unit weight in the body. The ret&#173;i&#173;nal blood vessels are analogous to the ce&#173;re&#173;bral blood vessels and maintain the inner blood–&#173;retina barrier. This physiologic barrier is due to the single layer of nonfenestrated endothelial cells, whose intercellular junctions, &#173;under physiologic conditions, are impervious to tracer substances such as fluorescein and &#173;horse&#173;radish peroxidase (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-36</span>). A basal lamina covers the outer surface of the endothelium and is surrounded by pericytes, or mural cells, which suppress endothelial proliferation and, along with glial cells, contribute to the inner blood–&#173;retina barrier (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-37</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells and other glial ele&#173;ments are generally attached to the basal lamina of ret&#173;i&#173;nal blood vessels. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal blood vessels lack an internal elastic lamina and the continuous layer of smooth muscle cells found in other vessels in the body. In the absence of the latter, &#173;there is no autonomic regulation of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ret&#173;ina possesses a dual circulation in which the inner ret&#173;ina is supplied by branches of the central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery, and the outer ret&#173;ina is supplied by the choroid (see Fig 2-32). Ret&#173;i&#173;nal arterioles give rise to the superficial capillary plexus and the deep capillary plexus, which supply the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer, respectively (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-38</span>). The ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular supply is discussed in detail in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous</span>. The outer nuclear layer and remaining layers of the outer ret&#173;ina are perfused by the choroid. The outer plexiform layer represents a watershed zone in regard to perfusion. Perfusion by the 2 circulations can vary with the location in or thickness of the ret&#173;ina, as well as with light exposure. In approximately 18%–32% of eyes, a cilioret&#173;i&#173;nal artery, derived from the posterior ciliary circulation, also supplies the macula.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels exhibit several characteristics. In contrast to choroidal vessels, &#173;ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels demonstrate dichotomous branching. Also, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels do not normally cross the horizontal raphe. The occurrence of such suggests the presence of anastomoses, which can often be found in the temporal macula following ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein&#160;occlusions. Further, ret&#173;i&#173;nal arteries do not intersect with other arteries; similarly, &#173;ret&#173;i&#173;nal veins do not intersect with other veins. At arteriovenous crossings, the 2 vessels share a common sheath, which often represents the site of branch ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusions.</p>
			<p class="h3">Stratification of the neurosensory ret&#173;ina</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The neurosensory ret&#173;ina can be divided into several layers (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig 2-39;</span> see also <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig 2-35</span>). The photoreceptor outer segments represent the outermost layer and interact with the apical pro&#173;cesses of the RPE. A potential space exists between this outermost layer of the neurosensory ret&#173;ina and the RPE and is the plane of separation in ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. The roof of the subsensory space is demarcated by the <span class="italic">external limiting membrane (ELM),</span> which separates the photoceptor nucleus from its inner and outer segments (see Fig 2-33). The ELM is not a true membrane and is formed by the attachment sites of adjacent photoreceptors and M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells. It is highly permeable, allowing the passage of oxygen and macromolecules from the choroid into the outer ret&#173;ina.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Photoreceptor nuclei are found in the <span class="italic">outer nuclear layer (ONL).</span> The <span class="italic">outer plexiform layer (OPL)</span> is composed of synapses between the photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Horizontal-&#173;cell fibers descend into this region and regulate synaptic transmission. The OPL also accommodates the oblique axons of the rods and cones as they radiate from the foveal center. &#173;Because it contains more fibers, the OPL is thicker in the perifoveal region (see Fig 2-39). The radial fibers in this portion of the OPL are known as the <span class="italic">Henle fiber layer.</span> At the edge of the foveola, the Henle layer lies almost parallel to the internal limiting membrane, resulting in petaloid or star-&#173;shaped patterns when &#173;these extracellular spaces are filled with fluid or exudate (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-40</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Like the ELM, the <span class="italic">&#173;middle limiting membrane (MLM)</span> is not a true membrane but is rather a junctional system in the inner third of the OPL, where synaptic and desmosomal connections occur between photoreceptor inner fibers and pro&#173;cesses of bipolar cells. It is sometimes apparent on OCT as a linear density. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal blood vessels ordinarily do not extend beyond this point.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">inner nuclear layer (INL)</span> contains nuclei of bipolar, M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller, horizontal, and amacrine cells. The <span class="italic">inner plexiform layer (IPL)</span> consists of axons of the bipolar and amacrine cells and dendrites of the ganglion cells and their synapses. Amacrine cells, like the horizontal cells of the OPL, probably play an inhibitory role in synaptic transmission. The <span class="italic">ganglion cell layer (GCL)</span> is made up of the cell bodies of the ganglion cells that lie near the inner surface of the ret&#173;ina. The <span class="italic">nerve fiber layer (NFL)</span> is formed by axons of the ganglion cells. Normally, &#173;these axons do not become myelinated &#173;until &#173;after they pass through the lamina cribrosa of the optic nerve.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Like the ELM and MLM, the <span class="italic">internal limiting membrane (ILM)</span> is not a true membrane. It is formed by the footplates of the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells and attachments to the basal lamina. The basal lamina of the ret&#173;ina is smooth on the vitreal side but appears undulatory on the ret&#173;i&#173;nal side, where it follows the contour of the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells. The thickness of the basal lamina varies. The ILM is the point of contact of the ret&#173;ina and the cortical vitreous, the vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal interface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Overall, cells and their pro&#173;cesses in the ret&#173;ina are oriented perpendicular to the plane of the RPE in the &#173;middle and outer layers but parallel to the ret&#173;i&#173;nal surface in the inner layers. For this reason, deposits of blood or exudates tend to form round blots in the outer layers (where small capillaries are found) and linear or flame-&#173;shaped patterns in the NFL.</p>

			<p class="h2">Topography of the Ret&#173;ina</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There is considerable variation in ret&#173;i&#173;nal thickness (Figs 2-41, 2-42). The ret&#173;ina is thickest in the papillomacular bundle near the optic nerve (0.23&#160;mm) and thinnest in the foveola (0.10&#160;mm) and ora serrata (0.11&#160;mm).</p>
			<p class="h3">Macula</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinically, ret&#173;ina specialists tend to regard the macula, which is 5–6&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter, as the area between the temporal vascular arcades. Histologically, it is the region with more than 1 layer of ganglion cell nuclei (Fig 2-43; see also <span class="xref-figure">Figs 2-32,</span> 2-39, 2-40). See BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous,</span> for further detail.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The name <span class="italic">macula lutea</span> (which means <span class="italic">yellow spot</span>) derives from the yellow color of the central ret&#173;ina in dissected cadaver eyes or in eyes with ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment involving the macula. This color is due to the presence of carotenoid pigments, located primarily in&#160;the&#160;Henle fiber layer. Two major pigments—&#173;zeaxanthin and lutein—&#173;have been identified whose proportions vary with their distance from the fovea. In the central area (0.25&#160;mm from the fovea), the lutein-&#173;to-&#173;zeaxanthin ratio is 1:2.4, and in the periphery (2.2–8.7&#160;mm from the fovea), the ratio is greater than 2:1. This variation in pigment ratio corresponds to the rod-&#173;to-&#173;cone ratio. Lutein is more concentrated in rod-&#173;dense areas of the ret&#173;i&#173;na; zeaxanthin is more concentrated in cone-&#173;dense areas.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Fovea</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">fovea</span> is a specialized portion of the macula that appears as a central ret&#173;i&#173;nal depression. At approximately 1.5&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter, it is comparable in size to the optic nerve head (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig 2-39</span>). Its margins are clinically inexact, but in younger eyes, the fovea is evident ophthalmoscopically as an elliptical light reflex that arises from the slope of the thickened ILM of the ret&#173;ina. From this point inward, the basal lamina rapidly decreases in thickness as it dives down the slopes of the fovea &#173;toward the depths of the foveola, where it is barely vis&#173;i&#173;ble, even by electron microscopy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">foveola</span> is a central depression in the floor of the fovea, located approximately 4.0&#160;mm temporal and 0.8&#160;mm inferior to the center of the optic nerve head. It is approximately 0.35&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter and 0.10&#160;mm thick at its center. The borders of the&#160;foveola merge imperceptibly with the fovea. The nuclei of the photoreceptor cells in the region of the foveola bow forward &#173;toward the ILM to form the fovea externa (see&#160;Fig 2-40). Usually, only photoreceptors, M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells, and other glial cells are pres&#173;ent in this area.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The photoreceptor layer of the foveola is composed entirely of cones, whose dense packing accounts for the high visual acuity and color vision for which this small area is responsible. The foveal cones are &#173;shaped like rods but possess all the cytologic characteristics of extramacular cones. The outer segments are oriented parallel to the visual axis and perpendicular to the plane of the RPE. In contrast, the peripheral photoreceptor cell outer segments are tilted &#173;toward the entrance pupil.</p>

			<p class="h1">Retinal Pigment Epithelium</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top16">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE) develops from the outer layer of the optic cup and consists of a monolayer of hexagonal cells that extends anteriorly from the optic nerve head to the ora serrata, where it merges with the pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-45</span>). Its structure is deceptively &#173;simple considering its many functions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">vitamin A metabolism</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">maintenance of the outer blood–&#173;ocular barrier</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">phagocytosis of the photoreceptor outer segments</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">absorption of light (reduction of scatter)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">formation of the basal lamina of the Bruch membrane</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">production of the mucopolysaccharide matrix surrounding the outer segments</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">maintenance of ret&#173;i&#173;nal adhesion</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">active transport of materials into and out of the RPE</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Like other epithelial and endothelial cells, RPE cells are polarized. The basal aspect is intricately folded and provides a large surface of attachment to the thin basal lamina that forms the inner layer of the Bruch membrane. The apices have multiple villous pro&#173;cesses that envelop and engage with the photoreceptor outer segments (see Fig 2-45). Separation of the RPE from the neurosensory ret&#173;ina is called <span class="italic">ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Contiguous RPE cells are firmly attached by a series of lateral junctional complexes. The <span class="italic">zonulae occludentes</span> and <span class="italic">zonulae adherentes</span> not only provide structural stability but also play an impor&#173;tant role in maintaining the outer blood–&#173;ocular barrier (see Fig 2-45). The zonula occludens is the junction at which adjacent plasma membranes are fused, forming a circular band or &#173;belt around the surface of adjacent cells. A small intercellular space is pres&#173;ent between zonulae adherentes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">RPE cell dia&#173;meter varies from 10–14 <span class="greek">μ</span>m in the macula to 60 <span class="greek">μ</span>m in the periphery. In addition, compared with RPE cells in the periphery, RPE cells in the fovea are taller and thinner, contain more melanosomes, and have larger melanosomes. &#173;These characteristics account in part for the decreased transmission of choroidal fluorescence observed during fundus fluorescein angiography. The eye of a fetus or infant contains between 4 and 6 million RPE cells. Although the surface area of the eye increases appreciably with age, the increase in the number of RPE cells is relatively small. No mitotic figures are apparent within the RPE of the normal adult eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cytoplasm of the RPE cells contains multiple round and ovoid pigment granules <span class="italic">(melanosomes)</span> (see Fig 2-45)<span class="italic">.</span> &#173;These organelles develop in situ during formation of the optic cup and first appear as nonmelanized premelanosomes. Their development contrasts sharply with that of the pigment granules in uveal melanocytes, which are derived from the neural crest and &#173;later migrate into the uvea.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Lipofuscin granules</span> prob&#173;ably arise from the discs of photoreceptor outer segments and represent residual bodies from phagosomal activity. This so-&#173;called wear-&#173;and-&#173;tear pigment is less electron dense than are the melanosomes, and its concentration increases gradually with age. Clinically, &#173;these lipofuscin granules are responsible for the signal observed with fundus autofluorescence.</p>
			<p class="body-text">RPE cells also possess phagocytic function; they continually ingest the disc membranes shed by the outer segments of photoreceptor cells, enclosing them within <span class="italic">phagosomes</span>. Several stages of disintegration are evident at any given time. In some species, shedding and degradation of the membranes of rod and cone outer segments follow a diurnal rhythm synchronized with daily fluctuations of environmental light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cytoplasm of the RPE cell contains numerous mitochondria (which are involved in aerobic metabolism), rough-&#173;surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, a Golgi apparatus, and a large round nucleus (see Fig 2-45).</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Bruch Membrane</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top17">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Bruch membrane is a PAS-&#173;positive lamina resulting from the fusion of the basal laminae of the RPE and the choriocapillaris of the choroid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-46</span>). It extends from the margin of the optic nerve head to the ora serrata. Ultrastructurally, the Bruch membrane consists of 5 ele&#173;ments:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">basal lamina of the RPE</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">inner collagenous zone</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">relatively thick, porous band of elastic fibers</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">outer collagenous zone</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">basal lamina of the choriocapillaris</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">It is highly permeable to small molecules such as fluorescein. Defects in the membrane may develop in myopia, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, trauma, or inflammatory conditions and may, in turn, lead to the development of choroidal neovascularization. With age, debris accumulates in and thickens the Bruch membrane.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Ora Serrata</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top18">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ora serrata separates the ret&#173;ina from the pars plana (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-47</span>). Its distance from the Schwalbe line is between 5.75&#160;mm nasally and 6.50&#160;mm temporally. In myopia, this distance is greater; in hyperopia, it is shorter. Externally, the ora serrata lies beneath the spiral of Tillaux (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>, Fig 1-16).</p>
			<p class="body-text">At the ora serrata, the dia&#173;meter of the eye is 20&#160;mm and the circumference is 63&#160;mm; at the equator, the dia&#173;meter is 24&#160;mm and the circumference is 75&#160;mm. Topographically, the margin of the ora serrata is relatively smooth temporally and serrated nasally. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal blood vessels end in loops before reaching the ora serrata.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ora serrata is in a watershed zone between the anterior and posterior vascular systems, which may in part explain why peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration is relatively common. The peripheral ret&#173;ina in the region of the ora serrata is markedly attenuated. The photoreceptors are malformed, and the overlying ret&#173;ina frequently appears cystic in paraffin sections (Blessig-&#173;Iwanoff cysts; Fig 2-48).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Vitreous</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top19">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vitreous cavity occupies four-&#173;fifths of the volume of the globe. The transparent vitreous humor is impor&#173;tant to the metabolism of the intraocular tissues &#173;because it provides a route for metabolites used by the lens, ciliary body, and ret&#173;ina. Its volume is close to 4.0&#160;mL. Although it has a gel-&#173;like structure, the vitreous is 99% &#173;water. Its viscosity, however, is approximately twice that of &#173;water, mainly &#173;because of the presence of the mucopolysaccharide hyaluronic acid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-49</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">At the ultrastructural level, fine collagen fibrils (chiefly type II) and cells have been identified in the vitreous. The origin and function of &#173;these cells, termed <span class="italic">hyalocytes,</span> are unknown, but they prob&#173;ably represent modified histiocytes, glial cells, or fibroblasts. The fibrils at the vitreous base merge with the basal lamina of the nonpigmented epithelium of the pars plana and, posteriorly, with the ILM of the ret&#173;ina, the vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal interface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The vitreous adheres to the ret&#173;ina peripherally at the vitreous base (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-50</span>), which extends from 2.0&#160;mm anterior to the ora serrata to approximately 4.0&#160;mm posterior to it. Additional attachments exist at the optic nerve head margin, at the perimacular region surrounding the fovea, along the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels, and at the periphery of the posterior lens capsule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-51</span>). See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span> for further discussion of the vitreous.</p>
