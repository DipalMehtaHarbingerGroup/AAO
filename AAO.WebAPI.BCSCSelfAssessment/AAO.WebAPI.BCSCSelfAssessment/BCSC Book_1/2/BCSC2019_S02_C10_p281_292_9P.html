			<div id="Chapt10_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens is a transparent, avascular structure that, in concert with the cornea, focuses incident light onto the sensory ele&#173;ments of the ret&#173;ina. To do so, the lens must be transparent and must have an index of refraction higher than that of the surrounding fluids. The high refractive index is due to the high concentration of proteins—&#173;especially of soluble proteins called <span class="italic">crystallins</span>—in the lens cells. Furthermore, &#173;because &#173;there is &#173;little if any turnover of protein in the central region of the lens (where the oldest, denucleated cells are found), the proteins of the &#173;human lens must be extremely stable to remain functionally &#173;viable for a lifetime. Considering the lens’s mode of growth and the stresses to which the lens is chronically exposed, it is remarkable that in most &#173;people, lenses retain good transparency &#173;until &#173;later in life; visually significant opacities typically develop by the sixth or seventh de&#173;cade of life.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This chapter discusses the structure and chemical composition of the lens, as well as aspects of membrane function, metabolism, and regulatory pro&#173;cesses within the lens. BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract,</span> provides additional information about the lens, cataractogenesis, and cataract surgery.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Structure of the Lens</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Capsule</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens is enclosed in an elastic basement membrane called the <span class="italic">lens capsule</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-1</span>; see also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span>, Fig 2-28). The capsule is acellular and is composed primarily of type IV collagen; it contains smaller amounts of other collagens and extracellular matrix components (including glycosaminoglycans, laminin, fibronectin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan). The capsule is thicker on the anterior side of the lens, where the epithelial cells continue to secrete capsular material throughout life. On the posterior side of the lens, where &#173;there is no epithelium, the posterior fiber cells have &#173;limited capacity to secrete such material and the capsule is relatively thinner. The zonular fibers, from which the lens is suspended, insert into the capsule near the equator on both the anterior and posterior sides. The capsule is not a barrier to diffusion of &#173;water, ions, small molecules, or proteins up to the size of serum albumin (which has a molecular weight of 68,000).</p>
			<p class="h2">Epithelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A single layer of epithelial cells covers the anterior surface of the lens. &#173;These cells have full metabolic capacity and play the primary role in regulating the &#173;water and ion balance of the entire lens. Although the cells of the central epithelium are not mitotically active, a germinative zone exists as a ring anterior to the equator, where the epithelial cells divide. The new cells migrate &#173;toward the equator and begin to differentiate into lens fibers (see Fig 10-1). In the adult lens, epithelial cells are not normally found posterior to the equator.</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-6"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="BCSC2019_S02_C10_p281_292_9P-web-resources/image/1.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Cortex and Nucleus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Aside from the single layer of epithelial cells on its anterior surface, the lens is composed of lens fibers, which are long ribbonlike cells. &#173;These fibers are formed from epithelial cells at the lens equator; therefore, younger fibers are always exterior to older ones (see Fig 10-1 and Chapter&#160;2, Fig 2-29). The lens structure can be equated with the growth rings of a tree: the oldest cells are in the center, and the progressively younger layers, or shells, of fiber cells are &#173;toward the periphery. Unlike the case with many tissues, no cells are sloughed from the lens, and cells produced before birth remain at the center of the lens throughout life. The fiber mass of the adult lens can be divided into the <span class="italic">cortex</span> (the outer fibers, laid down &#173;after approximately age 20&#160;years) and the <span class="italic">nucleus</span> (the cells produced from embryogenesis through adolescence).</p>
			<p class="body-text">As new fiber cells elongate and differentiate into mature fibers, their cell nuclei form the <span class="italic">bow zone,</span> or <span class="italic">bow region,</span> at the lens equator (see Fig 10-1). Elongating fibers substantially increase their volume and surface area and express large amounts of both lens crystallins (discussed &#173;later) and a lens-&#173;fiber–&#173;specific membrane protein called the <span class="italic">major intrinsic pro</span><span class="italic">tein (MIP).</span> As the fibers become fully elongated and make sutures at each end with fibers that have elongated from the opposite side of the lens, they become mature, terminally differentiated fiber cells. The cell nuclei disintegrate, as do mitochondria and other organelles. This pro&#173;cess has been proposed to occur via <span class="italic">autophagy,</span> the degradation of the cell’s own unneeded and/or damaged components via a defined intracellular pro&#173;cess. &#173;There are several types of autophagy, and in each, the degradation is directed &#173;toward certain intracellular components:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-8">microautophagy: cytoplasmic material</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">chaperone-&#173;mediated autophagy: proteins that can be recognized by a heat shock protein complex</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">macroautophagy: cell organelles</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-9">mitophagy (a type of macroautophagy): mitochondria</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Elimination of cellular organelles is necessary in the central portion of the lens &#173;because such bodies are sufficiently large to scatter light and thereby degrade visual acuity. Also, with the loss of cell nuclei, the mature fibers lose the machinery required for synthesis of proteins.</p>

			<p class="h1">Chemical Composition of the Lens</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Plasma Membranes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The chemical composition of lens-&#173;fiber plasma membranes suggests that they are both very stable and very rigid. A high saturated fatty acid content, a high cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio, and a high concentration of sphingomyelin all contribute to the tight packing and low fluidity of the membrane. Although lipids make up only about 1% of the total lens mass, they constitute approximately 55% of the plasma membrane’s dry weight; cholesterol is the major neutral lipid. As the lens ages, the protein-to-lipid and cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratios increase as a result of phospholipid loss, especially in the nucleus.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lens Proteins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens has the highest protein content of any tissue in the body. In some species, more than 50% of lens weight is protein. Lens crystallins are a diverse group of proteins that are abundantly expressed in the cytoplasm of lens-&#173;fiber cells. They are thought to play crucial roles in providing the transparency and refractile properties essential to lens function. Crystallins constitute 90%–95% of total lens protein. In addition to crystallins, the lens has a full complement of enzymes and regulatory proteins that are pre&#173;sent primarily in the epithelium and in immature fiber cells, where most metabolic activity occurs.</p>
			<p class="h3">Crystallins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Crystallins are water-&#173;soluble proteins so named for their high abundance in the crystalline lens. Crystallins can be divided into 2 groups. One group includes <span class="greek">α</span>-&#173;crystallin and the <span class="greek">β</span>,<span class="greek">γ</span>-&#173;crystallin &#173;family, both of which seem to be pre&#173;sent in all vertebrate lenses but have also been demonstrated in other ocular tissues. The second group consists of the taxon-&#173;specific crystallins, which are pre&#173;sent only in certain species.</p>

The specific functions of the <span class="h4-text_greek">β</span>,<span class="h4-text_greek">γ</span>-&#173;crystallins are unknown. Acquired posttranslational modifications of <span class="h4-text_greek">β</span>-&#173;crystallins have been associated with cataract formation. Most expression of <span class="h4-text_greek">γ</span>-&#173;crystallins occurs early in development; thus, they tend to be most concentrated in the nuclear region of the lens. Given their compact and symmetric structures (which can pack very densely), <span class="h4-text_greek">γ</span>-&#173;crystallins tend to be highly concentrated in aged, hard lenses, which have &#173;little to no accommodative ability.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-12"><span class="h4-head">Taxon-&#173;specific crystallins</span> In addition to the <span class="h4-text_greek">α</span>-&#173;crystallin and <span class="h4-text_greek">β</span>,<span class="h4-text_greek">γ</span>-&#173;crystallins found in all vertebrate lenses, other proteins are abundantly expressed in vari&#173;ous phyloge&#173;ne&#173;tic groups. Taxon-&#173;specific crystallins have not been demonstrated in &#173;humans. However, they are pres&#173;ent in the developing eye of other species. Most taxon-&#173;specific crystallins are oxidoreductases, which bind pyridine nucleotides, and their presence in the lens significantly increases the concentration of the bound nucleotides. Reduced nucleotides absorb ultraviolet (UV) light and may protect the ret&#173;ina from UV-&#173;induced oxidation.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Cytoskeletal and membrane proteins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although most proteins in the normal lens are &#173;water soluble, several impor&#173;tant structural proteins can be solubilized only in the presence of chaotropic agents or detergents. &#173;These water-&#173;insoluble proteins include the cytoskeletal ele&#173;ments <span class="italic">actin</span> (actin filaments), <span class="italic">vimentin</span> (intermediate filaments), and <span class="italic">tubulin</span> (microtubules), as well as 2 additional proteins called <span class="italic">filensin</span> and <span class="italic">phakinin.</span> The last 2 proteins have been found only in lens-&#173;fiber cells and compose a cytoskeletal structure, the <span class="italic">beaded filament,</span> which is unique to the lens. The filamentous structures of the cytoskeleton provide structural support to the cells and play crucial roles in pro&#173;cesses such as differentiation, motility and shape change, and organ&#173;ization of the cytoplasm. Mutations of the beaded filament have been shown to result in congenital cataract formation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lens-&#173;fiber membranes have 1 quantitatively dominant protein, MIP. MIP is expressed only in lens-&#173;fiber cells and was &#173;earlier thought to be a gap-&#173;junction protein. In fact, it is not a connexin but rather an aquaporin—&#173;a member of a large, diverse &#173;family of proteins involved in regulating &#173;water transport. MIP has been reported to function as a &#173;water channel and to play a role in cell adhesion. Mutations in the <span class="italic">MIP</span> gene lead to cataract formation.</p>

			<p class="h3">Posttranslational modifications to lens proteins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The proteins of the lens are some of the longest-&#173;lived in the body; the oldest ones (in the center of the lens nucleus) are synthesized before birth. As would be expected, &#173;these proteins become structurally modified in vari&#173;ous ways: oxidation of sulfur and aromatic residue side chains, inter-&#173; and intrapolypeptide crosslinking, glycation, racemization, phosphorylation, deamidation, and carbamylation. Many of &#173;these modifications occur early in life and are prob&#173;ably part of a programmed modification of the crystallins that is required for their long-&#173;term stability and functionality. &#173;There is evidence that certain of &#173;these pro&#173;cesses (phosphorylation, thiol oxidation) are reversible and may serve a regulatory function, although this hypothesis remains to be proved.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is known that as the proteins age (particularly in some cataracts), certain oxidative modifications accumulate, which contributes to the crosslinking of crystallin polypeptides, alterations in fluo&#173;rescent properties, and an increase in protein-&#173;associated pigmentation. In par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, the formation of disulfide crosslinks in the proteins of the lens nuclear region is associated with the formation of protein aggregates, light scattering, and cataract.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-15">Transparency and Physiologic Aspects of the Lens</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Lens Transparency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Transparency of the lens depends on the precise organ&#173;ization and maintenance of its ele&#173;ments. This is accomplished structurally by the orderly spatial distribution of the lens fibers and by the tight connections formed between them via specialized interdigitations (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-</span><span class="xref-figure">2</span>). Light scatter is reduced by the minimized space between cells. Scatter is also diminished by the loss of nuclei and organelles as the lens fibers elongate and approach the visual axis. Light scatter alters lens transparency, thereby affecting vision. Loss of transparency can have beneficial effects. In the aging lens, accumulation of yellow chromophores protects the ret&#173;ina from shorter wavelengths of light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cornea and aqueous humor protect the ret&#173;ina from wavelengths below the vis&#173;i&#173;ble spectrum. The vis&#173;i&#173;ble spectrum refers to the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is perceived as light, with wavelengths normally considered to range from 400&#160;nm to 700&#160;nm. Wavelengths shorter than 400&#160;nm are referred to as <span class="italic">UV light.</span> Wavelengths of 300&#160;nm or below are blocked by the cornea and by ascorbate (vitamin C), which is pre&#173;sent at high levels in the aqueous humor. Wavelengths of 360&#160;nm or below are blocked by the lens (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Lens Physiology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because of its avascularity and its mode of growth, the lens &#173;faces some unusual physiologic challenges. All nutrients must be obtained from the surrounding fluids. Likewise, all waste products must be released into &#173;those fluids. Most of the cells of the adult lens have reduced metabolic activity and lack the membrane machinery to regulate ionic homeostasis in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dently. Understanding how the lens maintains ionic balance and how solutes move from cell to cell throughout the lens is crucial to comprehending the normal biology of the organ and the maintenance of lens transparency.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the normal lens, sodium (Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>) levels are low (≈10&#160;mmol/L), and potassium (K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>) levels are high (≈120&#160;mmol/L). In the aqueous humor, Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> levels are approximately 150&#160;mmol/L, and K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> levels are about 5&#160;mmol/L. When normal regulatory mechanisms are abrogated, K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> leaks out of the lens and Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> floods in, followed by chloride (Cl<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">–&#173;</span>). &#173;Water then enters in response to the osmotic gradient, causing loss of transparency by disrupting the normally smooth gradient of refractive index, as can occur following traumatic violation of the lens capsule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ionic balance in the lens is maintained primarily by Na<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase (also called <span class="italic">sodium-&#173;potassium pump</span>), an intrinsic membrane protein complex that hydrolyzes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport Na<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> out of and K<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> into the lens (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-4</span>). Functional Na<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase pumps are found primarily at the anterior surface of the lens, in the epithelium and the outer, immature fibers. Studies using ouabain, a specific inhibitor of Na<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase, have established the pump’s role as the primary determinant of the normal ionic state of the lens. Lens cells also contain membrane channels that pass ions; in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, K<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;selective channels have been studied by patch-&#173;clamp techniques and found to be pre&#173;sent primarily in the epithelial cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Communication between lens cells is provided by gap junctions, which are thought to account for most ion and small-&#173;molecule movement between cells. In fact, the density of gap junctions in the lens-&#173;fiber cells is greater than that in all other cells in the body. True gap junctions occur in the lens and are composed of members of the connexin &#173;family.</p>

			<p class="h1">Lens Metabolism and Formation of Sugar Cataracts</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top6">
			<p class="h2-h1">Energy Production</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Energy, in the form of ATP, is produced in the lens primarily through <span class="italic">glycolysis</span> in metabolically active cells in the anterior lens. This pro&#173;cess is required &#173;because the oxygen tension in the lens is much lower than that in other tissues, given that oxygen reaches the avascular lens only via diffusion from the aqueous humor.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most of the glucose entering the lens is phosphorylated to glucose-6-&#173;phosphate by hexokinase, the rate-&#173;limiting enzyme of the glycolytic pathway. &#173;Under normal conditions, most glucose-6-&#173;phosphate passes through glycolysis, wherein 2 molecules of ATP are formed per original molecule of glucose. A small proportion of glucose-6-&#173;phosphate is metabolized through the <span class="italic">pentose phosphate pathway</span> (also called <span class="italic">hexose monophosphate shunt</span>). This pathway is activated &#173;under conditions of oxidative stress &#173;because it is responsible for replenishing the supply of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) that becomes oxidized through the increased activity of glutathione reductase &#173;under such conditions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Carbohydrate Cataracts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Much research on lens carbohydrate metabolism has been stimulated by interest in <span class="italic">sugar cataracts,</span> which are associated with diabetes mellitus and galactosemia. True diabetic cataract is a rapidly developing bilateral snowflake cataract (see Fig 5-16&#160;in BCSC Section&#160;11<span class="italic">, Lens and Cataract</span>) that appears in the lens cortex of persons with poorly controlled type&#160;1 diabetes mellitus. Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus do not typically develop this type of cataract but do have a higher prevalence of age-&#173;related cataract with a slightly &#173;earlier onset. It is likely that for &#173;these patients, the diabetes is simply an additional &#173;factor contributing to the development of age-&#173;related cataracts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Defects in galactose metabolism also cause cataracts. Classic galactosemia is caused by a deficiency of galactose-1-&#173;phosphate uridyltransferase. Infants with this inborn error of metabolism develop bilateral cataracts within a few weeks of birth &#173;unless milk (lactose) is removed from the diet. Cataracts are also associated with a deficiency of galactokinase. &#173;Under certain conditions in which sugar levels are elevated significantly, some glucose (or galactose) is metabolized through the <span class="italic">polyol pathway,</span> also known as the <span class="italic">sorbitol pathway</span> (see Fig 10-5). Aldose reductase is the key enzyme for the pathway, and it converts the sugars into the corresponding sugar alcohols. &#173;Because aldose reductase has a very high <span class="italic">K</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">m</span> (apparent affinity constant) value—&#173;that is, low affinity—&#173;for glucose (or galactose), &#173;under normal conditions &#173;little or no activity occurs through this pathway. &#173;Under hyperglycemic conditions, however, aldose reductase competes with hexokinase for glucose (or galactose).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Studies using animal models have established the importance of the polyol pathway in experimental sugar cataracts. Animals with diabetes mellitus (&#173;either natu&#173;ral or induced) develop cataracts that are associated with the presence of sorbitol in the lens and with the influx of &#173;water. The osmotic hypothesis may account for &#173;these findings. According to this hypothesis, the activity of aldose reductase is central to the pathology by serving to increase the sorbitol content of the lens. Sorbitol is largely unable to penetrate cell membranes and thus is trapped inside the cells. &#173;Because its further conversion to fructose by polyol dehydrogenase is slow, sorbitol builds up in lens cells &#173;under conditions of hyperglycemia such that it creates an osmotic pressure that draws &#173;water into the lens, swelling the cells, damaging membranes, and causing cataract.</p>

Near the equator is the bow region, where the lens-&#173;fiber cells elongate &#173;until their 2 ends meet. At this point, they are fully mature and as they are pushed inward by newer fibers, they lose their nuclei and organelles, making up the lens cortex. &#173;There is no shedding of &#173;these fibers over time. Thus, the lens continues to increase in size throughout life. <span class="figure-source-note">(Reproduced with permission from Friedman NJ, Kaiser PK, Trattler WB.</span> <span class="figure-source-emphasis">Review of Ophthalmology.</span> <span class="figure-source-note">3rd&#160;ed.
