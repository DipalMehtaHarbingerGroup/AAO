			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Considerable pro&#173;gress has been made in understanding the biochemistry of vision over the past 15 to 20&#160;years, as witnessed by the numerous reviews, research articles, and books published during this time. Part IV, Biochemistry and Metabolism, was written for prac&#173;ti&#173;tion&#173;ers and residents in ophthalmology, as well as for students and researchers seeking a concise picture of the current state of knowledge of the biochemistry of the eye. Recent growth in new information about vision biochemistry has been accompanied by increased specialization among ophthalmic researchers. &#173;These chapters cover most areas of research in ocular biochemistry, including tear film; cornea; aqueous humor, iris, and ciliary body; lens; vitreous; ret&#173;i&#173;na; ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium; and &#173;free radicals and antioxidants. The text relates basic science to clinical prob&#173;lems that may be encountered during residency training and in subsequent practice.</p>

			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The precorneal tear film (ie, tear film) is the first ocular structure that light encounters. &#173;Because of the lower refractive index of air relative to that of the tear film, the air–&#173;tear film interface at the surface of the cornea constitutes a major refractive ele&#173;ment of the eye, directing light &#173;toward the cornea.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Evidence supports a 2-&#173;phase model of the tear film, in which a lipid layer overlies a mucoaqueous layer.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Elevated tear film osmolarity is diagnostic of dry eye syndrome.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;There is mounting evidence that ocular surface inflammation is integral to the pathology of dry eye syndrome.</li>
			</ul>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Overview</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Human tears are distributed among the marginal tear strip (or <span class="italic">tear meniscus</span>) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-1</span>), the preocular film covering the exposed bulbar conjunctiva and cornea (<span class="italic">precorneal tear film,</span> also called <span class="italic">tear film</span>), and the conjunctival sac (between the eyelids and bulbar conjunctiva).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The primary functions of the precorneal tear film are to</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-4">provide a smooth optical surface at the air–&#173;cornea interface</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">allow diffusion of oxygen and other nutrients</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-5">serve as a medium for removal of debris and protect the ocular surface</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The tear film protects the cornea and ultimately the entire eye by carry&#173;ing tear constituents and debris to the lacrimal puncta, providing a medium for antimicrobial agents (lysozyme and lactoferrin, among &#173;others) and immunoglobulins, and preventing desiccation of the ocular surface barrier.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Historically, the precorneal tear film was viewed as a 3-&#173;layer “sandwich” composed of distinct lipid, aqueous, and mucin layers. Evidence continues to support a 2-&#173;phase model of the tear film, in which a lipid layer overlies a mucoaqueous phase (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-2</span>). Components of the tear film (lipids, mucins, proteins, and salts) may interact to prevent tear film evaporation and collapse; however, additional studies are needed to confirm this concept.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Mea&#173;sure&#173;ments of tear film thickness have differed widely, but more recent studies using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and reflectometry have found the tear film to be approximately 3.4 <span class="greek">μ</span>m thick. The steady-&#173;state volume of tears is 7.4 <span class="greek">μ</span>L for the unanesthetized eye and 2.6 <span class="greek">μ</span>L for the anesthetized eye; this volume decreases with age. Some properties of the normal &#173;human tear film are given in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;7-1</span>.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Lipid Layer</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The outermost layer of the tear film, or <span class="italic">lipid</span> layer, has the following functions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">retards evaporation of the tear film</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">contributes to the optical properties of the tear film &#173;because of its position at the air–&#173;tear film interface</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">maintains a hydrophobic barrier <span class="bullet-list_italic">(lipid strip)</span> that prevents tear overflow by decreasing surface tension</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">prevents damage to eyelid margin skin by tears</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The lipid layer is approximately 43&#160;nm thick and contains polar and nonpolar lipids in multilayers with a complex lipid composition. Polar amphiphilic phospholipids interact with the mucoaqueous layer, and a thick layer of nonpolar hydrophobic lipids occupies the outermost layer at the air–&#173;eye interface (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-3</span>). &#173;These phospholipids are secreted primarily by the <span class="italic">meibomian (tarsal) glands,</span> which are located in the tarsal plate of the upper and lower eyelids and are supplied by parasympathetic nerves that are cholinesterase-&#173;positive and contain vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Sympathetic and sensory nerves are pres&#173;ent but sparsely distributed. Neuropeptide Y (NPY)–&#173;positive nerves are abundant. &#173;There are approximately 30–40 meibomian glands in the upper eyelid and 20–30&#160;in the lower eyelid. Each gland orifice opens onto the skin of the eyelid margin, between the tarsal <span class="italic">gray line</span> and the mucocutaneous junction (see Chapter&#160;1, Fig 1-27). The sebaceous glands of Zeis, located at the eyelid margin close to the eyelash roots, also secrete lipid, which is incorporated into the tear film. Clinically, tear film evaporation can be evaluated by assessing the tear breakup time (see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The melting point of meibomian gland secretion ranges from 32°C to 40°C. With meibomian gland inspissation in chronic marginal blepharitis, the melting point is elevated, and the secretions become stagnant. In a study to determine &#173;whether tear film lipid layer thickness was altered &#173;after therapy with warm, moist compresses, samples of meibomian secretions from subjects without meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) started to melt at 32°C, whereas secretion samples from subjects with MGD &#173;were found to begin melting at 35°C. Five minutes &#173;after initiation of compress therapy, the tear film lipid layer was shown to increase in thickness more than 80%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Oral supplementation with omega-3 essential fatty acids (eg, fish oil) has been demonstrated to decrease symptoms associated with <span class="italic">dry eye syndrome (DES)</span> in &#173;women<span class="italic">,</span> presumably &#173;because of its direct effects on tear film fatty acids. However, research suggests that carotenoids and tocopherols in the oil or eicosanoids produced from the fatty acids of the oil may have a positive effect on inflammation (see the section Tear Dysfunction) and on differentiation of the meibomian gland cells.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Mucoaqueous Layer</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The functions of the mucoaqueous layer are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">transmits oxygen to the avascular corneal epithelium</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">maintains a constant electrolyte composition over the ocular surface epithelium</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">provides an antibacterial and antiviral defense</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">smooths minute irregularities of the anterior corneal surface</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">modulates corneal and conjunctival epithelial cell function</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">converts the corneal epithelium from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic layer, which is essential for the even and spontaneous distribution of the tear film</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">interacts with the tear lipid layer to reduce surface tension, thereby stabilizing the tear film</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">lubricates the eyelids as they pass over the globe</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Aqueous Component</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The core aqueous stratum is secreted by the main and accessory lacrimal glands (see Chapter&#160;1, Fig 1-38). The main lacrimal gland is divided into 2 anatomical parts, the <span class="italic">orbital</span> and the <span class="italic">palpebral</span> lobes, by the lateral horn of the levator aponeurosis. The <span class="italic">glands of Krause,</span> which constitute two-&#173;thirds of the accessory lacrimal glands, are located in the lateral part of the upper fornix. A number of Krause glands are also pres&#173;ent in the lower fornix. The <span class="italic">glands of Wolfring</span> are variably located along the proximal margin of each tarsus. The accessory lacrimal glands are structurally like the main lacrimal gland.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The main lacrimal gland is richly innervated by parasympathetic nerves containing the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and VIP. The sympathetic innervation is less dense than the parasympathetic and contains norepinephrine and NPY as neurotransmitters. The sensory nerves are sparsely supplied with the neurotransmitters substance P and calcitonin gene–&#173;related peptide (CGRP). The accessory lacrimal glands are densely innervated, but the majority of nerves are unidentified. Some of this innervation consists of nerves containing VIP, substance P, and CGRP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The aqueous stratum consists of electrolytes, &#173;water, and proteins. <span class="italic">Electrolytes</span> and small molecules regulate the osmotic flow of fluids between the corneal epithelial cells and the tear film, buffer tear pH, and serve as enzyme cofactors in controlling membrane permeability. The sodium (Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>) concentration of tears parallels that of serum; however, the concentration of potassium (K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>) is 5–7 times that of serum. Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>, K<span class="CharOverride-1">+</span>, and chloride (Cl<span class="CharOverride-1">–</span>) regulate the osmotic flow of fluids from the cornea to the tear film and thereby contribute to corneal clarity. Bicarbonate (HCO<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">3</span><span class="CharOverride-1">–</span>) regulates tear pH. Other tear electrolytes (Fe<span class="CharOverride-1">2+</span>, Cu<span class="CharOverride-1">2+</span>, Mg<span class="CharOverride-1">2+</span>, Ca<span class="CharOverride-1">2+</span>, PO<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span><span class="CharOverride-1">3–</span>) are enzyme cofactors.</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-7"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="BCSC2019_S02_C07_p243_258_9P-web-resources/image/1.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Tear film solutes</span> include urea, glucose, lactate, citrate, ascorbate, and amino acids. All enter the mucoaqueous layer of the tear film via the systemic circulation, and their concentrations parallel &#173;those of serum levels. Fasting tear glucose levels are 3.6–4.1&#160;mg/mL in &#173;those with and those without diabetes mellitus. However, &#173;after a 100-mg oral glucose load, tear glucose levels exceed 11&#160;mg/mL in 96% of diabetic persons tested.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Proteins</span> in the mucoaqueous layer of the tear film include immunoglobulin (Ig) A and secretory IgA (sIgA). IgA is formed by plasma cells in interstitial tissues of the main and accessory lacrimal glands (see Chapter&#160;1, Fig 1-39) and by the substantia propria of the conjunctiva. The secretory component is produced within lacrimal gland acini, and sIgA is secreted into the lumen of the main and accessory lacrimal glands. IgA plays a role in local host-&#173;defense mechanisms of the external eye, as shown by increased levels of IgA and IgG in &#173;human tears associated with ocular inflammation. Other immunoglobulins in tears are IgM, IgD, and IgE.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vernal conjunctivitis &#173;causes elevated tear and serum levels of IgE, increased IgE-&#173;producing plasma cells in the &#173;giant papillae of the superior tarsal conjunctiva, and elevated histamine levels. Increased levels of tear histamine support the concept of conjunctival TC (tryptase and chymotryptic proteinase containing) mast-&#173;cell degranulation triggered by IgE–&#173;antigen interaction. TC mast cells are unique to the conjunctiva and are specifically sensitive to commercially available topical mast-&#173;cell stabilizers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in the tear film have been shown to be elevated in patients with severe disorders affecting the ocular surface, including Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren syndrome and graft-&#173;vs-&#173;host disease, as well as in patients &#173;after &#173;laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). MMP-9 cleaves epithelial basement membrane components and tight-&#173;junction proteins. MMP-9 levels have been shown to parallel corneal staining severity and may represent a sign of late-&#173;stage DES. In addition, expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) has been shown to be upregulated on lymphocytes and/or vascular endothelial cells, resulting in lymphocytic migration to the lacrimal and conjunctival tissues in DES.</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-7"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="BCSC2019_S02_C07_p243_258_9P-web-resources/image/2.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-8">Lysozyme, lactoferrin, group II phospholipase A<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>, lipocalins, and defensins are impor&#173;tant antimicrobial constituents of the mucoaqueous layer. Interferon is also pres&#173;ent; it inhibits viral replication and may be efficacious in limiting the severity of herpetic keratitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, the mucoaqueous layer of the tear film contains a wide array of cytokines and growth &#173;factors, including transforming growth &#173;factor <span class="greek">β</span>s, epidermal growth &#173;factor, fibroblast growth &#173;factor <span class="greek">β</span>, interleukin 1<span class="greek">α</span> and 1<span class="greek">β</span>, and tumor necrosis &#173;factor <span class="greek">α</span>. &#173;These constituents may play a role in the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. They may also regulate wound healing of the ocular surface.</p>
			<p class="h2">Mucin Component</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The mucin component of the mucoaqueous layer coats the microplicae of the superficial corneal epithelial cells and forms a fine network over the conjunctival surface. In addition to mucin, it contains proteins, electrolytes, &#173;water, and carbohydrates in a polar <span class="italic">glycocalyx.</span> Mucins are glycoproteins; they have a protein backbone modified by the covalent addition of multiple long carbohydrate chains composed of repeating sugar molecules strung end to end (see Figs 7-2, 7-3).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Two main types of mucins are produced within the body: secreted and membrane-&#173;spanning. Secreted mucins are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-9">divided into gel-&#173;forming mucins and soluble mucins</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">released into the extracellular environment</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-10">secreted principally by the goblet cells of the conjunctiva</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Membrane-&#173;spanning mucins (also called <span class="italic">membrane-&#173;anchored, membrane-&#173;bound, membrane-&#173;</span><span class="italic">tethered mucins</span>) are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-9">embedded in the lipid bilayer of the cells</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-10">expressed by the stratified squamous cells of the conjunctival and corneal epithelia</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some think that the membrane-&#173;spanning mucins help spread the secreted mucins across the ocular surface. Both are minimally secreted by the main lacrimal gland. Goblet cells produce mucin at a rate of 2–3 <span class="greek">μ</span>L/day, which contrasts with the 2–3&#160;mL/day of aqueous tear production.</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-11">Tear dysfunction may result when tear mucins are deficient in number (eg, in vitamin A deficiency and conjunctival destruction), excessive in number (eg, in hyperthyroidism; foreign-&#173;body stimulation; and allergic, vernal, and &#173;giant papillary conjunctivitis), or biochemically altered (eg, in keratoconjunctivitis).</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-12"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="BCSC2019_S02_C07_p243_258_9P-web-resources/image/3.png" alt="" /></p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-13">Tear Secretion</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Contrary to earlier belief—&#173;which ascribed basic secretion to the accessory lacrimal glands of Krause and Wolfring and reflex secretion to the main lacrimal gland—it is now thought that all lacrimal glands function as a unit in conjunction with the ocular surface and the brain. In addition, the cornea and conjunctiva can respond by secreting electrolytes, &#173;water, and mucins.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the meibomian glands are innervated, it is not known &#173;whether nerves mediate lipid secretion from &#173;these glands. Reflex tear secretion is neurally mediated and induced in response to physical irritation (ie, superficial corneal and conjunctival sensory stimulation by mechanical, thermal, or chemical means), psychogenic &#173;factors, and bright light. Induction of sensory nerves by a local neural reflex activates the parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves that innervate the tear glands and epithelia, causing secretion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-4</span>). Tear turnover rate has been demonstrated to be significantly lower in a sympto&#173;m&#173;atic patient with dry eye (5%) than in an asymptomatic dry eye patient (12%).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A neural feedback mechanism for tear secretion has been widely accepted. The cornea and lacrimal gland are not directly connected; however, corneal damage profoundly affects the lacrimal gland, which, in turn, downregulates tear production. In the <span class="italic">vicious circle theory of DES,</span> this downregulation is due to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines that block neural signals for tear secretion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-5</span>). The feedback loop, initiated by inflammation on the surface of the eye, further suppresses or downgrades lacrimal gland function, creating a vicious circle that worsens DES (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-6</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Peptide and ste&#173;roid hormones constitute another mechanism for stimulating tear secretion (in addition to nerves), as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Peptide hormones, including <span class="bullet-list_greek">α</span>-&#173;melanocyte-&#173;stimulating hormone (<span class="bullet-list_greek">α</span>-&#173;MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), stimulate protein secretion from the main lacrimal gland.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">Ste&#173;roid hormones, specifically the androgens, stimulate secretion of sIgA from the main lacrimal gland and lipid from the meibomian glands.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Eyelid movement is impor&#173;tant in tear film renewal, distribution, turnover, and drainage. As the eyelids close in a complete blink, the superior and inferior fornices are compressed by the force of the preseptal muscles, and the eyelids move &#173;toward each other, with the upper eyelid moving over the longer distance and exerting force on the globe. This force clears the anterior surface of debris and any insoluble mucin and expresses secretions from meibomian glands. The lower eyelid moves horizontally in a nasal direction and pushes tear fluid and debris &#173;toward the superior and inferior puncta. When the eyelids are opened, the tear film is redistributed. The upper eyelid pulls the mucoaqueous phase of the tear film by capillary action. The lipid layer spreads as fast as the eyelids move, so that no area of the tear film is left uncovered by lipid.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Tear Dysfunction</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A qualitative or quantitative abnormality of the tear film may occur as a result of</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">change in the amount of tear film constituents</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">change in the composition of the tear film</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">uneven dispersion of the tear film &#173;because of corneal surface irregularities</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">in&#173;effec&#173;tive distribution of the tear film caused by eyelid–&#173;globe incongruity</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The amount or composition of the tear film can change &#173;because of aqueous deficiency, mucin deficiency or excess (with or without associated aqueous deficiency), lipid abnormality (meibomian gland dysfunction), and/or ocular surface exposure. The inciting &#173;factors for a dysfunctional tear film are multifactorial (see Fig 7-6).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Increases in tear film osmolarity are diagnostic of DES and can be found in blepharitis and with contact lens use. The preocular tear film is dispersed unevenly with an irregular corneal or limbal surface (inflammation, scarring, dystrophic changes) or poor contact lens fit. Eyelid–&#173;globe incongruity results from congenital, traumatic, or neurogenic eyelid dysfunction or absent or dysfunctional blink mechanism and results in in&#173;effec&#173;tive tear film distribution. Also, although overall hormone balance is unique to each person, estrogen and androgen deficiencies—&#173;combined with stress, pollution, and poor diet—&#173;produce a number of signs and symptoms, including dry eye, especially in postmenopausal &#173;women. In addition, the quality and quantity of the tear film diminish with age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnostic tests for tear dysfunction include tear breakup time, fluorescein staining, lissamine green staining, &#173;rose bengal staining, osmolarity testing, Schirmer test, tear meniscus evaluation, and MMP-9 testing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There is increasing evidence that DES is associated with ocular surface inflammation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-7</span>). In vari&#173;ous studies, adhesion molecule expression by conjunctival epithelial cells, T-&#173;cell infiltration of the conjunctiva, and increases in soluble mediators (cytokines and proteases) in the tear film have been found in patients with DES. Preliminary clinical studies have shown that using tear substitutes to treat patients with DES may reduce tear osmolarity and improve ocular symptoms. Moreover, a variety of anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (including corticosteroids, cyclosporine, lifitegrast, and doxycycline) have been used as therapy for DES and observed to improve the clinical symptoms of &#173;these patients (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Topical cyclosporine A emulsion and lifitegrast are approved by the US Food and&#160;Drug Administration for treating the inflammatory component of DES. Cyclosporine, a fungus-&#173;derived peptide emulsion, has been shown to be effective in stimulating aqueous tear production in patients with DES. Lifitegrast, a lymphocyte function–&#173;associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) antagonist that inhibits binding of ICAM-1 to LFA-1, has been shown to reduce inferior corneal staining and provided greater symptom relief in treated patients with DES than in control groups. No significant systemic or ocular adverse events (except for burning symptoms) &#173;were observed.</p>
