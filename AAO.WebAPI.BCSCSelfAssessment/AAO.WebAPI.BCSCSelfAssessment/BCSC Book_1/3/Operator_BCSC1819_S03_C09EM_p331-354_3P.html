Of course, these pinhole images are small and dim. A better alternative is to use a +1.00 lens, held about waist-high, to project an image of the sun on the ground (see figure). How far should the lens be held from the ground to obtain a sharp image?</p>

			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">b.</span> The magnification of a pinhole camera is limited by the distance from the pinhole to the image plane. The image formed by a pinhole camera is inverted, not upright. The small aperture limits the light available for image formation, requiring lengthy exposure times and poor sensitivity in dim light. The depth of field is nearly unlimited.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;2.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">b.</span> The sun is certainly a “distant object”! A +1.00 lens forms images of a distant object 1.0&#160;m from the lens, on the opposite side of the lens from the object. </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;3.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">a.</span> The power of the original lens system is given by the vergence equation: <span class="CharOverride-1">U</span> + <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> = V. Here 0 + <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> = 1/1.00, so <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> = +1.00 D. The net power of the new lens system is the sum of the original power plus the power of the added lens: <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span><span class="CharOverride-10">new</span> = <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span><span class="CharOverride-10">old</span> + 3.00 = 4.00 D. This new lens system forms an image according to the vergence equation: 0 + 4.00 = 1/<span class="CharOverride-1">v</span>, so <span class="CharOverride-1">v</span> = +0.25 m.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;4.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> The key to converting a power-cross description to a spherocylindrical specification is to determine the <span class="CharOverride-1">difference</span> between the power in the 2 principal meridians. Here, the difference is 3.00 diopters (D). As we are asked for the answer in minus cylinder form, the spherical component is the power in the more positive meridian, here +1.00. The cylindrical component is thus –3.00 D. This power is observed along the 115° meridian and is created by a minus cylinder lens component with axis 90° away; that is, axis 25°. </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;5.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">d.</span> The compensation of the sphere power is always in the opposite direction from the change in cylinder power, in the ratio of a change in the sphere of one-half the change in cylinder. </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;6.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">b</span><span class="CharOverride-12">.</span> A flat pane of glass displaces a beam of light, allowing it to continue in the original direction, as the deflection at each interface has an equal and opposite effect on the direction of the light beam. A prism may disperse white light into a spectrum, but in this case, the (yellow) light is monochromatic. The magnitude of the deflection of light by a prism depends on the orientation of the prism, but the deflection is always toward the base of the prism. </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;7.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> The power of the mirror <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> = –2/<span class="CharOverride-1">r</span> = –2.0 D. Thus the vergence equation reads –1/10.0 + (–2.0) = 1/<span class="CharOverride-1">v</span> so <span class="CharOverride-1">v</span> = 1/(–2.1) = –0.47 m; that is 0.47m away from the mirror on the side opposite the source object. This will be an erect, virtual image, minified by a factor of 0.47/10.0 = 0.047. Such a small image is interpreted by the driver as an object farther away than the original source object—as the reminder printed on the mirror suggests: “OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR.”</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;8.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">d.</span> Transverse magnification (sometimes also referred to as <span class="CharOverride-1">linear magnification</span>) is the ratio of the size of the image to the size of the source object, as measured perpendicular to the optic axis. Longitudinal magnification (also known as <span class="CharOverride-1">axial magnification</span>) is the ratio of the length of the image to the length of the source object, as measured along the optic axis. Neither concept is applicable to objects at astronomical distances. Angular magnification, the ratio of the apparent angle subtended by the image to that of the source object, is appropriate for afocal systems such as astronomical telescopes.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;9.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> Vergence is the ratio of refractive index, <span class="CharOverride-1">n,</span> divided by the distance from the object or to the image. Vergence (in diopters [D]) = <span class="CharOverride-1">n</span>/distance (in meters). Vergence is negative for divergent light and positive for convergent light. In this case, the lenses are in air, for which the refractive index, <span class="CharOverride-1">n,</span> is 1.000. Light diverges from the object so the vergence is negative. The object is 1.0 m from the lens and therefore has a vergence of −1.00 D = −1.000/1.0 m = −1.00 D. The first lens adds an additional −1.00 D of vergence. Light leaving the lens, therefore, has a vergence of −2.00 D. Light rays with a vergence of −2.00 D appear to be coming from a point 0.5 m to the left of the lens.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;10.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">b.</span> To answer questions 9 and 10, we treat the intermediate image as the object for the second lens. From this point on, the first lens can be ignored. The intermediate image is 2.0 m to the left of the second lens. The vergence of light entering the second lens is, therefore, –0.50 D. The lens adds +1.50 D of vergence. Therefore, the light exiting the lens has a vergence of +1.00 D. Light rays with a vergence of +1.00 D come to a focus 1.0 m to the right of the second lens. </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;11.<span class="CharOverride-12">&#9;b.</span> Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) are common refractive surgeries of the cornea. These procedures are based on photoablation using excimer lasers generating photons with wavelengths in the ultraviolet range that are absorbed within the corneal tissue.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;12.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">d.</span> The Airy disc is the central portion of a pattern of light and dark rings formed when light from a point source passes through a circular aperture and is diffracted. The formula for the diameter of the Airy disc is diameter = 2.44λ <span class="CharOverride-1">f/D</span>, where λ is the wavelength of the light, <span class="CharOverride-1">f</span> is the focal length of the eye, and <span class="CharOverride-1">D</span> is the diameter of the pupil. Thus, eyes with shorter focal lengths have a smaller Airy disc than eyes with longer focal lengths and therefore diffract less. Similarly, diffraction increases as the pupil size decreases and the wavelength of light increases. Retinal conditions such as macular degeneration have no effect on the size of the Airy disc. </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;13.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">b.</span> Retinal image sizes are readily computed using the nodal point of the Gullstrand model eye, which is located 17 mm in front of the retina. By similar triangles, the diameter of the retinal image of an object located 333 mm from the eye, with a diameter of 9 mm, is 9 mm × (17/333) = 0.46 mm.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;14.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> A change in acuity by a factor of 10 (such as a change from 20/20 to 20/200) corresponds to a difference of 1.0 LogMAR, since 1.0 is the common logarithm of 10. The common logarithm of 2 is 0.301, which we round to 0.30 for clinical purposes. This is “built-in” to the common ETDRS eye charts, which feature proportional steps of 0.10 LogMAR between lines, so that a 3-line change in acuity corresponds to a change of 0.30 LogMAR (ie, a doubling [or halving] of the visual angle). </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;15.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">d.</span> The far point is the point conjugate to the fovea, with relaxed accommodation. In an emmetropic eye, this is at optical infinity. The hyperopic eye has a refractive apparatus with less optical power than that which produces emmetropia, so rays originating at the fovea emerge as diverging rays from the eye, and thus produce a virtual image <span class="CharOverride-1">behind</span> the eye. A suitable plus sphere lens images distant objects at the far point, correcting this refractive error.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;16.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">a.</span> Inhomogeneous cataracts frequently split the incident light into 2 or more divergent paths, resulting in monocular diplopia. Dry age-related macular degeneration may reduce retinal sensitivity to the diminished retinal illumination seen through a pinhole, but does not cause double vision. (Macular edema may cause monocular diplopia, however.) &#173;Recently acquired strabismus frequently causes binocular diplopia, but this resolves if either eye is covered. As these examples illustrate, the notion that monocular diplopia cannot be physiologic in origin is clearly incorrect.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;17.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">b.</span> A 20/20 optotype is 5 minutes of arc in height, or 1/12 of a degree. To convert from degrees to radian measure, multiply by π/180, since there are 180° in a half-circle. So our 20/20 optotype must subtend π/(180 × 12) = 0.00145 radians. At 304.8 cm, this spans a height of 0.44 cm.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;18.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> Jackson cross cylinder, astigmatic dial, and stenopeic slit tests are all subjective measures of astigmatism. Retinoscopy is a means of objectively determining the refractive status of an eye, including the astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;19.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> The method of spheres is a measurement of the amplitude of accommodation. The gradient and heterophoria methods are ways to determine the accommodative convergence/accommodation (AC/A) ratio. The prism dissociation test allows direct comparison of the eyes and confirmation of equal fogging to be performed prior to determining the final sphere refinement.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;20.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">d.</span> The far point of the eye and the focal point of the original glasses coincide at this location: –0.125 –0.015 m = –0.140 m (in front of the eye). The same calculation with a 20-mm vertex distance requires a lens with a focal length of –0.120 m (since –0.120 –0.020 also equals –0.140). Thus, the required lens has a power of 1/(–0.120) = –8.33 D, a difference of –0.33 D.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;21.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> If the green side is still clearer after the initially fogging, the eye was probably over-minused prior to the test. Additional fogging (plus lens power) should be added until the 2 sides of the duochrome chart are equally clear, or the red side is clearer.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;22.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">d.</span> Refracting in a short room is inherently inaccurate because normal fogging techniques to relax accommodation will not be effective. One method to relax the accommodation would be to move the patient to a longer hallway to complete the refraction in a trial frame. Another option would be to install mirrors to optically extend the room length to 6 meters. </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;23.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> The old glasses do not give clear vision for distance, and now function almost as reading glasses. New spectacles, fully correcting the distance vision about 12 mm from the eye, have the advantage of “near effectivity,” which reduces accommodative demand, compared to an emmetropic eye or one corrected by a contact lens. In this age range (eg, 46&#160;years of age), people with myopia who are still able to read with their correct distance glasses are likely to find it more difficult to read with contact lenses. The presbyopic myopic patient wearing glasses can also read more easily by pushing the glasses farther away from the eyes.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;24.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> To achieve a good fit with contact lenses, the rear surface’s curvature is chosen according to the shape of the cornea. The central rear surface is usually spherical, but can be toric in shape to fit a cornea with astigmatism. Peripheral curvatures of both the cornea and the rear surface of the contact lens are flatter. A “tear lens” fills in space between the cornea and lens, especially with rigid contact lenses. The desired power of the contact lens is then achieved by adjusting the shape of the front surface of the contact lens. Spectacle lenses are manufactured with various base curvatures, which can be measured with a “lens clock.” The lens manufacturer uses a standard series of base curves for various lens powers, chosen to minimize aberrations associated with off-axis viewing through the glasses. Exceptions from a standard series of base curves are made, for example, to match the patient’s previous glasses, or to deal with aniseikonia—changing the magnification by changing the base curve. </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">25.&#9;&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">d.</span> Standard keratometry misses the flattest part of the cornea of eyes that have undergone myopic keratorefractive correction. This results in an overestimation of corneal power by keratometry and, if these values are employed in intraocular lens calculation, a hyperopic refractive surprise. Radial keratotomy corneas are also steeper in the mid-periphery than they are in the central cornea and are susceptible to instrument errors from keratometry as well. Misjudgment of the effective lens position occurs when employing standard IOL formulas to myopic keratorefractive eyes and this too results in hyperopic refractive surprise.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;26.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> Positive dysphotopsias are speculated to be caused by internal reflections within the intraocular lens. Flashes and complaints of a curtain impinging upon central vision are both suggestive of retinal detachment and should not be ascribed to dysphotopsias. Dysphotopsias do indeed occur even when the intraocular lens is appropriately positioned within the capsular bag.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;27.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">a. </span>Monofocal intraocular lenses demonstrate the highest modulation transfer function (MTF) peaks. Extended-depth-of-focus (EDOF) lenses have lower amplitude depressions between peaks than conventional multifocal intraocular lenses. Higher MTF values signify higher image quality. In examination of an intraocular lens’s modulation transfer function, the pupil size and the spatial frequency of the object are always specified. Alterations of either of these will affect the MTF curve.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;28.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">b.</span> Misalignment of a toric intraocular lens by as little as 10° will result in a substantial reduction in the efficacy of the astigmatism correction. Misalignment by 90°, rather than merely negating the benefit of the toric lens, will double the patient’s resultant astigmatism. Excyclotorsion may be observed when the patient lies down. However, the degree of cyclotorsion is variable and unpredictable. Any misalignment of a toric intraocular lens (other than a misalignment of exactly 90°) will also rotate the patient’s postoperative astigmatic axis.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;29.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">a.</span> Diffractive multifocal lenses dissipate about 20% of the light entering the pupil. This light does not find its way to the retina. Patients with maculopathy are poor candidates for multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs). These lenses are highly sensitive to decentration. Although many clinical parameters are important in the decision to insert a multifocal IOL, the IOL formulas employed are the same as those for conventional mono&#173;focal IOLs.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;30.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">b.</span> A 0.8 D change in keratometry value (K) corresponds to approximately a 1.00 D change of refraction. The following equation is often used to predict corneal curvature after keratorefractive surgery: K<span class="CharOverride-10">postop</span> = K<span class="CharOverride-10">preop</span> + (0.8 × RE), where K<span class="CharOverride-10">preop</span> and K<span class="CharOverride-10">postop</span> are preoperative and postoperative <span class="CharOverride-1">K</span> readings, respectively, and <span class="CharOverride-1">RE</span> is the refractive error to be corrected at the corneal plane. When myopic corrections are performed, the minimum corneal power tolerable is 33.0 D. Therefore, the formula becomes 33.0 = K<span class="CharOverride-10">preop</span> + (0.8 × –10.00) where K<span class="CharOverride-10">preop </span>equals 41.0.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;31.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c</span><span class="CharOverride-12">.</span> All forms of keratorefractive surgical procedures produce some form of unwanted optical aberrations. Small-incision lenticule extraction and photorefractive keratectomy act as surgical removal procedures. Intracorneal ring segments act as surgical addition procedures, changing the relationship between the anterior and posterior curvature of the cornea. Aphakic intraocular lens adds an intraocular lens into the system and, after the healing of the surgical incisions, causes minimal change in the higher-order aberrations of the eye.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;32.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> Positive defocus, also known as <span class="CharOverride-1">myopia</span>, is a lower-order aberration that is correctable with spectacles. All other aberrations are higher order, such as vertical coma and trefoil, which are fourth-order aberrations, and secondary astigmatism and spherical aberration, which are fifth-order aberrations. These higher-order aberrations can be correctable with rigid gas-permeable lenses and wavefront-guided keratorefractive surgery, but not with spectacles.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;33.<span class="CharOverride-12">&#9;d.</span> The retinal nerve fiber layer is birefringent, meaning it polarizes light or changes the polarization of incident light that passes through it. The scanning laser polarimeter uses this property to measure nerve fiber layer thickness. The cornea is also birefringent, so a corneal compensator is necessary to eliminate the cornea’s polarization effects.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;34.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">d.</span> With direct ophthalmoscopy, the examiner uses the optics of the patient’s eye as a simple magnifier to look at the retina. The optics of the normal eye are approximately +60&#160;D, so using the formula for a simple magnifier, the magnification is 60/4, or 15×. If the patient’s eye is myopic, a minus lens is dialed in, to overcome the extra plus power “error lens” inside the patient’s eye. Those 2 lenses create a Galilean telescope effect, increasing magnification and decreasing the field of view. Similarly, the retina of a hyperopic eye will be magnified less than 15× because of the reverse Galilean telescope created by the minus power error lens inside the patient’s eye and the plus lens of the direct ophthalmoscope. Thus, the size of the optic disc will appear smaller in a hyperopic eye—of which aphakia is an extreme example—than in an emmetropic eye or a myopic eye.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;35.<span class="CharOverride-12">&#9;a.</span> Vivid recurrent hallucinations, some degree of vision loss, no other neurological signs or symptoms, and full insight that what is seen is not real are all required to make a diagnosis of Charles Bonnet syndrome. A diagnosis other than Charles Bonnet syndrome should be considered when patients do not have full insight that what they are seeing is not real.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;36.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-12">c.</span> Legal blindness (due to visual field constriction) in the United Sates is determined as a visual field of equal to or less than 20° around central fixation measured with a Goldmann III4e target. A point seen at 10 dB or higher on a static automated threshold field test is considered to be seen with a 4e stimulus. A mean defect of 22 dB or greater on an automated 30° static threshold perimetry test is also considered legal blindness by the Social Security Administration in the United States. </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">3&#9;7.<span class="CharOverride-12">&#9;d.</span> Patients with foveal-sparing scotomas have difficulty seeing large targets, such as larger letters on a visual acuity chart or larger text such as headlines of a newspaper, depending on the size of the remaining central visual field. </p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;38.<span class="CharOverride-12">&#9;a.</span> Contrast sensitivity varies with spatial frequency or target size. The contrast sensitivity curve represents the relationship between contrast threshold and spatial frequency.</p>

This patient has uncorrected myopia of 4.00 D in addition to the +6.00 D of reading add, therefore an effective reading add of +10.00 D. This requires a reading distance at the focal point of the lens, which will be 1/10 m (ie, 10 cm, or 4 in).</p>
