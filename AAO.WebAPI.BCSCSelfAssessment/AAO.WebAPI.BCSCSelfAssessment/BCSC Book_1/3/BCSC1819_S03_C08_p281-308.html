			<p class="h1">Introduction</p>
		  <div id="Chapt8_Top2"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In this chapter, we discuss the basic princi&#173;ples and under&#173;lying concepts of vari&#173;ous optical instruments that are commonly used to examine the eye. The discussion includes some recent state-&#173;of-&#173;the-&#173;art technological developments.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Refraction and Topography</p>
					<div id="Chapt8_Top3"> 
					<p class="body-text--no-indent-">
			<p class="h2-h1">Lensmeter</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Manual lensmeter</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lensmeter mea&#173;sures the power of a spectacle or contact lens. It uses a fixed lens positioned a focal length away from the spectacle plane at the tip of the nose cone (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-1</span>), by which the vergence induced in the spectacle plane becomes linearly related to moving a target.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the lensmeter, an illuminated target is moved, varying the vergence at the tip of the nose cone, &#173;until it becomes focused on the reticle of a telescope. The target is focused only when parallel rays are entering the telescope (ie, when the light entering has zero vergence), which indicates that the “unknown” lens is exactly neutralizing the vergence that is coming out of the nose cone. The &#173;actual power of the lens can then be read from a dioptric scale, which is opposite of the power emerging from the nose cone.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The addition of the telescope facilitates the detection of zero vergence. This is &#173;because it magnifies vergence by the square of the power of the telescope, which enables the examiner to detect very small deviations from zero vergence without having his or her uncorrected refractive error cause significant error in the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment. For best accuracy, the eyepiece can be adjusted beforehand, by focusing it on a reticle located inside the telescope, which eliminates any residual effect from the examiner’s refractive error.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Note that we cannot mea&#173;sure the true power of a lens with the lensmeter, as this would require us to mea&#173;sure from the lens’s principal planes rather than from the lens’s surface. To mea&#173;sure the distance correction using a lensmeter, we place the spectacle lens on the nose cone with the &#173;temples turned away from us, so the nose cone is against the back surface, &#173;because spectacle lenses are designated by their back vertex power (ie, the reciprocal of their back focal length).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The target usually has a set of lines (eg, the American cross-&#173;line target as depicted in Fig 8-2) that permits the observer to determine &#173;whether the lens has cylindrical power. In the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of cylindrical power, as illustrated in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;8-2A</span>, the cross-&#173;line target is first rotated, as well as moved forward or backward, &#173;until one set of lines is sharp. Then, it is moved forward or backward &#173;until the perpendicular set of lines is sharp. The difference in target settings is the cylindrical power. The cylindrical axis is read from a scale indicating the orientation of the cross-&#173;line target in degrees.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prism in spectacles can also be detected by means of a lensmeter. If &#173;there is no prism pres&#173;ent in the lens, the center of the cross-&#173;line target &#173;will be in the center of the lensmeter reticule. If, however, the intersection of the target lines is off-&#173;center (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-2B</span>), and the lens must be shifted away from the patient’s normal viewing position to recenter it in the reticule, then one knows that prism is pres&#173;ent in the spectacle lens. If the intersection of the target lines is decentered horizontally, horizontal prismatic power is pres&#173;ent, whereas a vertical shift indicates the presence of vertical prism power, with the shift in the direction of the prism base. In <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;8-2B</span>, the target lines are vertically displaced upward from the center, as is the case when vertical prism power, base-up, is pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When determining a patient’s reading add, the examiner places the spectacles on the nose cone with the &#173;temples turned around, &#173;toward the examiner, so that the front of the glasses rests on the nose cone. The front vertex power of the distance portion is mea&#173;sured, which &#173;will be significantly dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from the back vertex power for high plus lenses (in cases other than a distance lens with strong plus power, &#173;there is usually &#173;little or no clinically significant difference in the mea&#173;sure&#173;ments), and the front vertex power of the near portion is mea&#173;sured. The difference in power between the distance and near portions of the lens specifies the reading-&#173;add power.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Automatic lensmeter</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The princi&#173;ples under&#173;lying automatic lensmeters differ from &#173;those of manual ones. Automated lensmeters do not neutralize the unknown lens but rather mea&#173;sure the deflection of light rays (similar to automated refractors) as they pass through vari&#173;ous parts of the lens to calculate lens power and prismatic effect.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Autorefractors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Autorefractors proj&#173;ect near-&#173;infrared or infrared light into the eye via a beam splitter and employ vari&#173;ous optical princi&#173;ples to reveal the eye’s refractive characteristics from the mea&#173;sured light reflected from the ocular fundus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The foundation for most of the optical princi&#173;ples employed in modern autorefractors (including automated lensmeters), and aberrometers was laid by Christopher Scheiner nearly 400&#160;years ago. Using an opaque disk perforated with 2 pinhole apertures (known as the <span class="italic">Scheiner disk</span>), he demonstrated that an eye’s spherical error could be mea&#173;sured. This <span class="italic">Scheiner princi&#173;ple</span> relies on the fact that a double-&#173;pinhole aperture placed before the eye evokes dif&#173;fer&#173;ent responses in an ametropic eye than in an emmetropic eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-3</span>). When looking at a small, distant light source, a normal (emmetropic) eye &#173;will see a single spot of light with or without the double-&#173;pinhole aperture upfront. In case of &#173;either myopia or hyperopia, on the other hand, 2 separate spots are seen when the double-&#173;pinhole aperture is in place. This is &#173;because in a myopic eye (for example), the 2 bundles of light that have been created by the double-&#173;pinhole aperture come to focus in the vitreous, crossing over and creating 2 separate spots on the ret&#173;i&#173;na; in a hyperopic eye, the 2 bundles of light come to focus beyond the ret&#173;ina, which also leaves 2 separate spots on the ret&#173;ina. One can refract an eye by placing diverse lenses in front of the eye, or by moving the point source axially, &#173;until a single spot of light is achieved on the ret&#173;i&#173;na.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A modified, objective form of this princi&#173;ple is still used &#173;today in most autorefractors. For example, in some instruments, the pinhole apertures are effectively replaced by 2 light-&#173;emitting diodes (LEDs) imaged in the pupillary plane. From the axial position of the LEDs required to achieve a single image on a camera, the patient’s refractive error is determined. This may be repeated in vari&#173;ous meridians to determine any astigmatic component of the refractive error.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many recent instruments use a stationary source of light to “flood” the eye and then isolate the light emerging from the eye into multiple beams (eg, via a Hartmann screen—&#173;essentially a Scheiner disk with multiple holes, or a multi-&#173;lenslet array, as described by Shack). They then measure the deflection or deviation from their ideal reference positions of the emerging individual light rays to infer the eye&apos;s refractive error. This method is commonly referred to as the <span class="italic">ray-&#173;deflection princi&#173;ple</span>. It enables, not just the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of spherocylindrical errors but also the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of higher-&#173;order aberrations, if multiple parts of the pupil are analyzed, as is done with aberrometers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The main difficulties with autorefractors are the result of &#173;human &#173;factors, such as poor fixation and accommodative fluctuation, including so-&#173;called <span class="italic">instrument myopia;</span> that is, the tendency to accommodate when looking into instruments. Vari&#173;ous methods of fogging and automatic tracking have been developed to overcome the latter, with some success.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Keratometer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The keratometer is used to approximate the refracting power of the cornea by determining the curvature of the central outer corneal surface. It does this by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the image size of a reflected mire in each of the principal meridians, accomplished by lining up prism-&#173;doubled images at a distance regulated by sharpness of focus. Note that doubling of the image is performed to avoid prob&#173;lems and inaccuracies from involuntary eye motion. &#173;There are 2 basic methods by which the doubled mire images are aligned with one another. For example, in the Javal-&#173;Schi<span class="accent">ø</span>tz-&#173;style keratometer (Haag-&#173;Streit USA, Mason, OH), the mire separation is adjusted while the image doubling is constant (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-4A</span>). In the Bausch <span class="symbol">+</span> Lomb (Bridgewater, NJ) style of keratometer, on the other hand, the mire location is fixed and the image doubling is variable (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-4B</span>). Corneal refractive power is inferred from the calculated radius of curvature using the formula for surface power <span class="italic">D</span> <span class="symbol">=</span> (<span class="italic">n–&#173;</span>1)/<span class="italic">r.</span> In practice, a correction for the small refractive effect (minus power) of the corneal back surface is incorporated in the value for the refractive index of the cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Conventional keratometry is performed at only 1 dia&#173;meter, approximately 3&#160;mm, and is therefore lacking the detail provided by more elaborate topography.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Automatic keratometers use princi&#173;ples similar to &#173;those used in automated lensmeters and refractors, mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the amount of deflection of the reflected light.</p>
			<p class="h2">Corneal Topography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Unlike keratometry instruments, corneal topography instruments produce a detailed map of the shape of the entire corneal surface. Originally, corneal topography was limited to analy&#173;sis of the anterior corneal surface, with the predominant technique being based on the Placido-&#173;disk princi&#173;ple (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-5</span>). Computerized Placido disk–&#173;based topographers assess the reflection of a circular mire of concentric lighted rings (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-6</span>). More precisely, the distance between the rings is mea&#173;sured, from which the height of the cornea is calculated and commonly displayed as dioptric color maps of the corneal surface (see also BCSC Section&#160;13, <span class="italic">Refractive Surgery</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Technological advances enable the characterization of both the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces. &#173;These alternative techniques are actually “tomography”-&#173;based (and therefore are also suited for corneal pachymetry) and derive topography in&#173;formation via elevation mea&#173;sure&#173;ments from cross-&#173;sectional images of the cornea obtained photographically. They involve the projection of slit beams of light that scan the cornea and &#173;either use a stereo-&#173;triangulation method (slit-&#173;scanning technique), or a camera that rotates perpendicular with the slit beams, to capture the illuminated corneal cross sections. The latter, known as the <span class="italic">Scheimpflug princi&#173;ple</span> or <span class="italic">Scheimpflug </span><span class="italic">camera</span>, corrects for the nonplanar shape of the cornea and, thus, enables “distortion-&#173;free” imaging.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Wavefront Aberrometers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal topography can mea&#173;sure the shape of the surface of an irregular cornea, but it cannot mea&#173;sure the &#173;actual refractive topography of the entire lens–&#173;cornea optical system. For such mea&#173;sure&#173;ments, instruments traditionally used in astronomy to mea&#173;sure optical distortions, or <span class="italic">wavefront aberrations</span>, induced by the inhomogeneous and turbulent earth atmosphere, have been applied to the examination of the &#173;human eye. &#173;These instruments are called <span class="italic">wavefront aberrometers</span> or simply <span class="italic">aberrometers</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Wavefront aberrometers are essentially ray-&#173;deflection autorefractors (the prototype of which was the Scheiner disk) that mea&#173;sure the deflection of light rays passing through many pupil locations, rather than just a few locations sufficient to determine only spherocylindrical errors of the eye, as described previously in the section on autorefractors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For ophthalmic applications, the most popu&#173;lar method employed for wavefront aberrometry is Hartmann-&#173;Shack aberrometry, which was first demonstrated by Josef Bille and colleagues in 1994.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Before getting into the details of the under&#173;lying princi&#173;ples, let us first review the nature of a wavefront. It is an artificial construct connecting points in a light ray bundle of equal travel time from a common source. This is perhaps best understood in the example of &#173;water waves, as illustrated in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;8-7</span>. The perfect wavefront shown on the top nicely illustrates that, in general, wavefronts are perpendicular to the ray direction. The concept of wavefront aberrations is simulated on the bottom, where we can see an irregular wavefront that becomes distorted by a floating twig.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In Hartmann-&#173;Shack aberrometry, ocular wavefront distortions are mea&#173;sured using a Hartmann-&#173;Shack wavefront sensor (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-8</span>), which consists of a micro-&#173;lenslet array and a charge-&#173;coupled device (CCD) camera. A micro-&#173;lenslet array is a lattice of tiny lenses that can be thought of as a multifaceted lens, like an insect eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-9</span>). An object imaged through such a lens results in multiple images of the same object arranged in an array. For example, in aberrometry, the light reflected out of the eye is partitioned into multiple beams by the micro-&#173;lenslet array, forming multiple images of the same ret&#173;i&#173;nal spot on the CCD camera. An ideal eye produces a perfect emerging wavefront and thus a regular array of spot images, with each image falling on the grid produced by the optical center of each facet of the multi-&#173;lenslet array (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-10A</span>). An eye with aberrations, however, produces an irregular wavefront and thus an irregular array of spot images, displaced from where they should other&#173;wise fall on the grid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-10B</span>). From the displacement of each spot, the shape of the wavefront can be reconstructed and represented in the form of a 2-&#173;dimensional wavefront map.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Slit-Lamp Biomicroscope</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As with many ophthalmic instruments, it is instructive to consider the illumination and viewing systems of the slit-&#173;lamp biomicroscope separately. The illumination system is a light source that is restricted by an adjustable aperture producing a slit of variable height, width, and orientation, to produce an optical section through the eye. The viewing system is a binocular stereomicroscope with individually focusable eyepieces. To vary the magnification of the viewing system, &#173;there may be a Galilean magnification changer, a rotating drum of Galilean telescopes that can be oriented &#173;either forward to provide higher magnification or backward to provide lower magnification. Alternatively, &#173;there may be 2 sets of eyepieces or objective lenses, or a zoom system in which lenses are moved back and forth to change the magnification.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The illumination system and the viewing system with its vari&#173;ous levels of magnification are mounted on separate arms. In ordinary usage, &#173;these rotate about the same vertical axis in a parfocal arrangement, so that they both focus precisely over a common pivot point. This arrangement allows the examiner to study the eye in <span class="italic">direct illumination</span>. Purposefully separating the illumination and viewing arms from their coupled alignment to horizontally and/or vertically decenter the beam allows for <span class="italic">indirect illumination</span>. Variations of &#173;these illumination techniques allow for examination of the anterior segment in a variety of ways, some of which are described &#173;next and illustrated in Figure&#160;8-11 (see also BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Examination Techniques</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Direct focal illumination</span>. This is the most commonly used examination technique, in which the examiner focuses on the area directly illuminated by the slit (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-11A</span>).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Retroillumination.</span> The beam can be decentered, so that it is striking the iris, with the examiner focusing with the microscope in front, on the cornea, for example. This enables the observer to see corneal opacities illuminated against the black pupil by the reflected light from the iris (iris retroillumination). As another example, by shining the beam through the edge of the pupil, one can observe opacities in the cornea, iris, and lens retroilluminated by the reflected light from the fundus (fundus retroillumination; <span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-11B</span>).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Sclerotic scatter.</span> The slit beam is decentered so that it strikes the junction between sclera and cornea, causing light to be totally internally reflected, like a fiber-&#173;optic light pipe (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-11C</span>). In this manner, light follows its longest pos&#173;si&#173;ble path through the cornea and makes nebular opacities more vis&#173;i&#173;ble against a dark pupil background.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">Specular reflection</span>. By looking directly at the bright reflection of the slit beam &#173;under high magnification, the examiner can observe irregularities in the corneal surface and see the endothelial cell pattern (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-11D</span>; this is the princi&#173;ple under&#173;lying specular microscopy).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are several attachments for the slit lamp that extend its use beyond &#173;these examination techniques, some of which are described below.</p>
			<p class="h2">Applanation Tonometry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In tonometry, the intraocular pressure (IOP) of an eye is mea&#173;sured. In Goldmann applanation tonometry specifically, performed with an attachment to the slit lamp, IOP is inferred from the amount of force required to flatten an area of 3.06&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter on the cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Applanation tonometry is based on Newton’s third law of motion, in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar that the pressure (ie, force per surface area) inside the eyeball equals the force applied to its surface divided by the area of contact. This assumes that the eye is infinitely thin-&#173;walled, perfectly elastic, and dry, none of which hold true, producing 2 confounding forces: (1) a force generated by the eye’s corneal rigidity (&#173;because the eye is not infinitely thin-&#173;walled or perfectly elastic), which is directed away from the globe; and (2) a force generated by the surface tension of the tear film (&#173;because the eye is not dry), which is directed &#173;toward the globe. Hans Goldmann determined empirically that if enough force is applied to produce a circular area of flattening 3.06&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter, the opposing forces caused by scleral rigidity and surface tension cancel each other out, allowing the pressure in the eye to be inferred from the force applied.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The head of the applanation tonometer, which is placed against the patient’s cornea, creating a tear film meniscus, contains split-&#173;field prisms that split the magnified image of tear film meniscus into 2 (like the image doubling associated with keratometry) separated by exactly 3.06&#160;mm. The tear film is often stained with fluorescein dye and viewed &#173;under a cobalt blue light to enhance the visibility of the resultant yellow/green circle of tears. The examiner adjusts the applanation pressure &#173;until the half circles are aligned so that their inner margins just touch one another (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-12</span>). At this point, the circle is exactly 3.06&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter, and the reading on the tonometer (multiplied by a &#173;factor of 10, as it is mea&#173;sured in dynes of force) represents the IOP in millimeters of mercury.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several &#173;factors, especially central corneal thickness, can substantially affect the accuracy of applanation tonometry (see BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Surgical Microscope</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The operating microscope works on princi&#173;ples similar to &#173;those of the slit-&#173;lamp biomicroscope. The illumination source of the operating microscope, unlike that of the slit-&#173;lamp biomicroscope, is not slit-&#173;shaped, and the working distance for the operating microscope is longer to accommodate the specific requirements of ocular surgery. The illumination is said to be “coaxial.” However, it is technically paraxial rather than coaxial (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-13</span>), as the viewing apertures and illumination path are separated in modern operating microscopes.</p>
			<p class="h2">Specular Microscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Specular microscopy is a modality for examining endothelial cells that uses specular reflection from the interface between the endothelial cells and the aqueous humor. The technique can be performed using contact or noncontact methods. In both methods, the instruments are designed to separate the illumination and viewing paths so that reflections from the anterior corneal surface do not obscure the weak reflection arising from the endothelial cell surface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As we learned earlier, endothelial cells can also be visualized through a slit-&#173;lamp biomicroscope, if the illumination and viewing axes are symmetrically displaced on &#173;either side of the normal line to the cornea (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-11D</span>). A narrow illumination slit must be used; hence, the field of view is narrow.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Contact specular microscopy allows for higher magnifications than slit-&#173;lamp biomicroscopy, making cellular detail and endothelial abnormalities more discernible and allowing for cell counting as well as the study of morphology (see also BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Auxiliary Lenses for Slit-&#173;Lamp Examination of the Ret&#173;i&#173;na</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cornea and lens together provide so much convergence that ordinarily we cannot see the ret&#173;ina using a slit-&#173;lamp biomicroscope. At most, the slit lamp could view about half of the way back from the crystalline lens to the ret&#173;ina, and usually no more than one third of the way. Auxiliary lenses for slit-&#173;lamp examination of the ret&#173;ina can be placed in front of the eye to overcome this prob&#173;lem. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;8-1</span> lists common auxiliary lenses for slit-&#173;lamp examination of the ret&#173;i&#173;na.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Goldmann 3-&#173;mirror contact gonioscopy lens is a special viewing lens that is widely used for looking at the eye with the slit lamp. With a power of about –64 D, it essentially nullifies the power of the eye (recall that the eye itself has about 60 D of plus power) and provides an upright view of the posterior pole. The mirrors inside the contact lens enable alternative (left-&#173;right reversed) views of more and less peripheral portions of the eye, and even of the &#173;angle of the anterior chamber (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-14</span>; gonioscopy). The main disadvantage of the Goldmann lens is its limited field of view requiring rotation of the lens to visualize more than a small patch of the fundus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other examples of contact lenses for the slit-&#173;lamp biomicroscope are the fundus contact lenses from manufacturers such as Volk (Mentor, OH) or Ocular Instruments (Bellevue, WA). Examples include the Area Centralis lens for viewing the central fundus, and the QuadrAspheric and TransEquator lenses that enable peripheral wide-&#173;angle views of &#160;the ret&#173;i&#173;na.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Holding a high-&#173;power plus lens (eg, 60 D or 90 D fundus lenses) in front of the eye, produces an inverted aerial image of the ret&#173;ina, which can be viewed with the slit lamp in a manner similar to performing “indirect ophthalmoscopy” (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-15</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Ophthalmoscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An ophthalmoscope is an instrument for viewing the ret&#173;ina and associated tissues—&#173;the ocular fundus. It consists of 3 essential ele&#173;ments: a source of illumination, a method of reflecting the light into the eye, and an optical means of correcting an unsharp image of the fundus. Imaging of the fundus is carried out &#173;either by direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy.</p>
			<p class="h3">Direct ophthalmoscope</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With direct ophthalmoscopy, the examiner uses the optics of the patient’s eye as a &#173;simple magnifier to look at the ret&#173;ina. If both the examiner and patient have emmetropic vision and are not accommodating, rays of light coming from a point on the patient’s ret&#173;ina exit parallel, with zero vergence, and continue through the empty peephole of the direct ophthalmoscope. &#173;These parallel rays of light are then focused onto the examiner’s ret&#173;ina. Thus, the examiner’s ret&#173;ina becomes conjugate to the patient’s ret&#173;ina when a direct ophthalmoscope is used.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When the examiner looks through the peephole of a direct ophthalmoscope, with no lenses in place, just past the edge of (or aperture in) a mirror that reflects light into the patient’s eye, almost coaxial to the examiner’s view, an upright, virtual, magnified ret&#173;i&#173;nal image is seen. The optics of the emmetropic normal eye are approximately <span class="symbol">+</span>60 D, so using the formula for a &#173;simple magnifier, the magnification is 60/4, or 15<span class="symbol">×</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-16</span>). This means that the patient’s ret&#173;ina appears 15 times larger than if the ret&#173;ina &#173;were removed from the eye and held at 25&#160;cm. Only a small field of view is seen with the direct ophthalmoscope (about 7°) &#173;because, even when being as close to the patient as pos&#173;si&#173;ble, the peripheral rays that are coming from the peripheral part of the patient’s ret&#173;ina cannot be captured, as they do not enter the examiner’s pupil (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-17</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the patient or examiner has an uncorrected spherical refractive error, a series of auxiliary lenses is available to dial into the path of the direct ophthalmoscope for compensation. If the patient’s eye is myopic, a minus lens is dialed in, to overcome the extra plus power “error lens” inside the patient’s eye. &#173;Those 2 lenses create a Galilean telescope effect, increasing magnification and decreasing the field of view. Similarly, the ret&#173;ina of a hyperopic eye &#173;will be magnified less than 15<span class="symbol">×</span> &#173;because of the reverse Galilean telescope created by the minus power error lens inside the patient’s eye and the plus lens of the direct ophthalmoscope.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Indirect ophthalmoscope</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In indirect ophthalmoscopy, an ophthalmic “condensing” lens is used to increase the field of view, by capturing the peripheral rays (that are lost in direct ophthalmoscopy) and bringing them into the examiner’s pupil (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-18</span>). Thus, a much wider field of view is seen with the indirect ophthalmoscope (eg, about 25° with an ordinary 20 D condensing lens).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Assuming that the patient’s eye has normal vision, rays of light coming from a point on the patient’s ret&#173;ina leave the eye with zero vergence and are gathered and focused by the condensing lens into what is called an intermediate <span class="italic">aerial image</span>; that is, an image of&#160;the patient’s ret&#173;ina in space. In case of a 20 D condensing lens, this image is located <br />one-&#173;twentieth of a meter closer to the examiner, who therefore sees an optically real, inverted image of the patient’s ret&#173;ina that appears to be 5&#160;cm closer to the examiner’s eye than the 20 D lens. With the examiner looking at that aerial image, it &#173;will be focused on the examiner’s ret&#173;ina. Thus, in indirect ophthalmoscopy, the patient’s ret&#173;ina, the aerial image, and the examiner’s ret&#173;ina are all conjugate to each other.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most impor&#173;tant conjugate planes in indirect ophthalmoscopy, however, are the cornea and the faceplate of the indirect ophthalmoscope (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-19</span>). The main purpose of the condensing lens, other than the purpose of forming the aerial image, is to make the faceplate of the indirect ophthalmoscope conjugate to the patient’s cornea, so that the bright illumination light passes at a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent place through the cornea, offset from where the examiner’s pupils are looking, to avoid reflections back from the cornea into the examiner’s eyes. This is very impor&#173;tant &#173;because the cornea reflects about 2% of the light, but the observed ret&#173;i&#173;nal image is only 0.1% of the light. Thus, the ret&#173;ina cannot be seen if any light from the cornea is reflected back into the observation pathway. Therefore, in indirect ophthalmoscopy, the light pathway is separated from the observation pathway by imaging the faceplate on the cornea with the condensing lens, so that the aerial image of the ret&#173;ina can be seen. The images of the observer’s pupils in the plane of the cornea are very small circles—&#173;about 10% of the observer’s pupil’s dia&#173;meters—&#173;and thus form virtual pinholes (the drawing in Figure&#160;8-19 shows &#173;these images much larger than they are in practice). &#173;These tiny entrance pupils limit the light available for the observer to view the fundus, but also allow very clear images to be appreciated even in the presence of imperfect ocular media, such as cataracts or vitreous debris. This is a mixed blessing—it allows for better views of the fundus than can be obtained in many cases, for example, with the direct ophthalmoscope, but prevents the observer from appreciating the visual impairments caused by the media imperfections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The binocular eyepieces in the indirect ophthalmoscope, via mirrors and/or prisms, reduce the interpupillary distance from about 60&#160;mm to 15&#160;mm, to fit the images of examiner’s pupils along with the light source within the patient’s pupil, allowing for binocular viewing. (If the patient’s pupil is small, the illuminating and observation pathways can be brought closer by varying the positions of mirrors or prisms in the eyepieces). This &#173;causes a reduction of the examiner’s stereoscopic vision by 60/15, or 4<span class="symbol">×</span>, which fortunately is compensated for by the axial magnification of the aerial image.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To appreciate this, let’s look at the transverse magnification of the aerial image, which turns out to be the power of the eye divided by the power of the condensing lens (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-20</span>), that is 60/20, or 3<span class="symbol">×</span>, for an emmetropic eye and a 20 D condensing lens. The aerial image is thus wider than the &#173;actual object on the ret&#173;ina. Recall that the axial magnification is the square of the transverse (lateral or linear) magnification, that is, in our case 9<span class="symbol">×</span>. The image that is observed is thus greatly distorted in depth, which helps make up for the loss in stereoacuity due to the reduced interpupillary distance. The eyepieces reduce depth fourfold, so the overall axial magnification is 9/4, or 2.25<span class="symbol">×</span>. Thus, &#173;things are observed 3&#160;times wider and 2.25 times increased in depth. Other choices of condensing lens power result in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ratios of transverse and lateral magnification.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, the threefold transverse magnification of the aerial image is not the overall transverse magnification of indirect ophthalmoscopy. The overall transverse magnification depends upon the distance from which the aerial image is observed. From about 40&#160;cm, from where it is usually observed, the overall transverse magnification is about 3<span class="symbol">×</span>25/40, or 1.87, with the 20 D condensing lens (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-21</span>), much less compared to a direct ophthalmoscope, which provided 15<span class="symbol">×</span> magnification (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-16</span>). In summary, small details are observed with the direct ophthalmoscope that cannot be seen with the indirect ophthalmoscope.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Fundus Camera</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The fundus camera uses the optical princi&#173;ples of indirect ophthalmoscopy. It is essentially an indirect ophthalmoscope with a perforated mirror taking the place of the faceplate of the indirect ophthalmoscope that separates the observation and illumination pathways, and the aerial image is simply reimaged onto the camera’s film or sensor array.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With the addition of dif&#173;fer&#173;ent filters, <span class="italic">fluorescein angiography</span> can be performed with the fundus camera. Fluorescein has its absorption maximum at about 490&#160;nm, in the blue part of the spectrum, whereas the emission maximum is at about 530&#160;nm, in the green part of the spectrum. In fluorescein angiography, an “excitation filter” permits blue light to pass and excite the fluorescein; on the return path, a “barrier filter” allows the green light to pass, but blocks the background blue light, allowing the fluo&#173;rescent image to be recorded with high-&#173;resolution monochrome film or sensor array.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Scanning &#173;Laser Ophthalmoscope</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscope functions as both an ophthalmoscope and a fundus camera but requires significantly less light than &#173;those conventional flood illumination systems. This is &#173;because in the scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscope, the use of a rapidly scanning &#173;laser (eg, a 670-nm diode &#173;laser) illuminating only a small spot of ret&#173;ina, allows inversion of the allocation of illumination and viewing apertures used in conventional systems. In other words, unlike the ophthalmoscope or fundus camera, where illumination uses most of the pupillary area with a separate small area reserved for viewing (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-22A</span>), the scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscope uses the larger area for light collection (“viewing”) and the smaller one for illumination (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-22B</span>). It is this inversion that improves the optical collection efficiency, allowing lower light intensity levels to be used.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In a scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscope, a highly collimated &#173;laser beam is physically moved via scanning mirrors over the ret&#173;ina in a grid pattern, delivering all its energy to a very small spot for a very short time. Light returned from each point is detected and synchronously decoded to produce an ocular fundus image.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following sections describe a few types of scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscopes.</p>
			<p class="h3">Confocal scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscope</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In confocal scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscopy, a pinhole is placed in front of the detector to cut off scattered or defocused light coming from outside the point of illumination or interest, which other&#173;wise can blur the image (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-23</span>). This results in a focused, high-&#173;contrast image of a single tissue layer located at the focal plane.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The position of the confocal aperture determines from which layer in the fundus the reflected light is collected, and it enables tomographic information to be extracted. More precisely, by moving the plane of the pinhole, multiple optical sections through the tissue of interest can be acquired.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The series of optical section images forms a layered 3-&#173;dimensional image and can be used to construct topography and reflectance images of the fundus. The topography image is constructed by identifying the peak intensity (reflectance) along the z-&#173;axis from all optical sections at each pixel location. The reflectance image is constructed as a summation of intensities along the z-&#173;axis from all of the optical sections at each pixel location.</p>
			<p class="h3">Confocal scanning &#173;laser microscope</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With the use of objective lenses, usually put in contact with the patient’s corneal surface, the confocal scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscope can be turned into a confocal &#173;laser scanning microscope, enabling tomography through dif&#173;fer&#173;ent depths of the cornea at cellular resolution (see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Angiography and autofluorescence imaging</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The use of vari&#173;ous wavelengths allows for additional applications with the confocal scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscope, such as fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, and autofluorescence imaging (see also BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">For <span class="italic">fluorescein angiography</span> with the scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscope, a blue argon &#173;laser at 488&#160;nm is used to excite the dye, while a barrier filter at about 500&#160;nm edge wavelength separates the excitation and fluo&#173;rescent light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The same &#173;laser is also used to generate fundus <span class="italic">autofluorescence</span> images, relying on the natu&#173;ral fluorescence occurring from the ret&#173;i&#173;nal layers, such as lipofuscin that accumulates in the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium. It may also be used (but without the use of the barrier filter) to create “red-&#173;free” or blue reflectance images, which can aid in the visualization of pathologies that have low contrast to the red color.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For <span class="italic">indocyanine green angiography</span>, on the other hand, a diode &#173;laser at 790&#160;nm wavelength is used to excite the dye, while a barrier filter at 810&#160;nm edge wavelength separates excitation and fluo&#173;rescent light.</p>
			<p class="h3">Scanning &#173;laser polarimeter</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ret&#173;i&#173;nal nerve fiber layer is birefringent, which means that polarized light travels through it at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent speeds depending on &#173;whether the polarization is along or across the fibers (see Chapter&#160;2). The scanning &#173;laser polarimeter is a confocal scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscope with an integrated ellipsometer that enables the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of this retardation. &#173;There is a linear relationship between the thickness of a birefringent medium and its retardation. By mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the total retardation of the &#173;human ret&#173;ina point by point in a raster pattern, from the change in polarization state in the light retroreflected from the fundus, a “topographic map” of the birefringent nerve fiber layer thickness in the eye’s ret&#173;ina can be created. This provides a quantitative method for detecting evidence of eye diseases such as glaucoma, which is characterized by loss of nerve fibers in its early state.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Optical Coherence Tomography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue to ultrasound imaging, using infrared light instead of sound. The much higher speed of light compared with sound allows for finer resolution, but direct electronic mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the shorter “echo” times it takes light to travel from dif&#173;fer&#173;ent structures at axial distances within the eye is not feasible. Interferometry enables us to overcome this difficulty in the following manner. Light is split into 2 beams, and the beam backscattered from the ocular tissue is then compared (interfered) with the beam that has traveled a known time from the reference mirror. Interference patterns are observable when the optical distances traveled by the 2 beams match to within the coherence length of the light. In OCT, broadband (ie, low coherent) light sources are used (eg, a superluminescent diode emitting a beam of light with long [red] wavelengths—&#173;reds being chosen &#173;because they are scattered in tissue less than is blue light), rather than narrow-&#173;band (ie, high coherent) light sources, such as a &#173;laser, &#173;because it gives the instrument greater sensitivity to the differences in time the 2 beams have traveled (see <span class="xref-vid">Video 2-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In time-&#173;domain OCT (TD-&#173;OCT; <span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-24</span>), the position of the mirror is adjusted so that interference patterns show up, as a function of time, whenever the 2 beams have traveled almost the same amount of time. Results similar to the ultrasound’s A-&#173;scan are generated, as light is reflected at interfaces between layers of tissue. Cross-&#173;sectional images are generated by performing successive A-&#173;scans at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent transverse positions on the ret&#173;ina or cornea, yielding 2-&#173;dimensional results like an ultrasound’s B-&#173;scan (see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous</span> and BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>). By acquiring sequential cross-&#173;sectional images, 3-&#173;dimensional, volumetric results are obtained.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In Fourier-&#173;domain OCT (FD-&#173;OCT), also called <span class="italic">spectral-&#173;domain OCT</span> or <span class="italic">frequency-&#173;domain OCT</span>, the reference beam mirror is fixed at one position. Interference fringe patterns, all mixed together, arise from the vari&#173;ous tissue interfaces, but Fourier analy&#173;sis enables them to be dissected apart. When the pattern arises from closer tissue interfaces, the fringe patterns’ undulations are spaced farther apart than &#173;those arising from deeper tissue planes, which yield fringes spaced more closely together. The more highly reflective tissue plane interfaces yield higher-&#173;amplitude fringe patterns. Thus, the spacing of the fringe pattern tells us how deep in the tissue it comes from, and its amplitude tells us how much the light is reflected by that tissue plane interface. In this manner, the A-&#173;scan of all the depths is obtained instantly without moving the reference mirror. Scanning across the ret&#173;ina (or cornea) yields 2-&#173; and 3-&#173;dimensional images. Thus, FD-&#173;OCT is much more efficient than TD-&#173;OCT, resulting in both greater speed and higher signal-&#173;to-&#173;noise ratio, and therefore higher-&#173;resolution images.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There are 2 implementations of FD-&#173;OCT: spectrometer-&#173;based or swept-&#173;source implementation. A spectrometer-&#173;based version of FD-&#173;OCT uses a prism or grating in front of the detector to separate light into its spectral components, whereas a swept-&#173;source version of the FD-&#173;OCT replaces the superluminescent diode’s band of frequencies with a tunable &#173;laser. The &#173;laser sequentially sweeps through dif&#173;fer&#173;ent frequencies, one at a time, and the A-&#173;scan is performed for each frequency at each location. Unlike spectrometer-&#173;based FD-&#173;OCT systems, swept-&#173;source-&#173;based systems are not limited by spectrometer resolutions and thereby support larger axial depth mea&#173;sure&#173;ment ranges. Also, commonly available swept sources have a wavelength centered at about 1 <span class="greek-tx">μ</span>m, thereby enabling imaging deeper into the tissue. This allows us to see the vitreous, ret&#173;ina, and choroid more easily in a single image.</p>
			<p class="h2">Adaptive Optics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Adaptive optics</span> (AO) refers to a technique to compensate for distortions caused by optical aberrations in the media between the camera and the object being imaged. It was originally developed for use in astronomical telescopes to compensate for optical distortions induced by the inhomogeneous earth atmosphere. It has since evolved to become a power&#173;ful clinical tool in ophthalmology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In an ophthalmic AO system, a wavefront sensor, such as the Hartmann-&#173;Shack wavefront sensor, mea&#173;sures the distorted wavefront emerging from the eye, made irregular by aberrations of the cornea and crystalline lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Note that even for a normal eye, as the pupil enlarges, optical aberrations in the peripheral areas of the anterior segment come into play and may result in considerable distortions to the ret&#173;i&#173;nal image. For example, &#173;under low lighting conditions, the pupil dilates to approximately 5–7&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter. Higher-&#173;order aberrations become significant and lead to broadening of the point spread function (PSF, the image of a point source of light; see Chapter&#160;2).</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;After mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the distortion of the retina-&#173;reflected light, the AO system “un-&#173;distorts” the beam via reflection by a deformable mirror. This is a very special mirror with a flexible surface and multiple electric actuators that can rapidly deform the mirror surface to modify the impinging aberrated wavefront accordingly, thereby effectively removing the distortions, as represented in <span class="xref-vid">Video 8-1</span>.</p>

One should note that AO by itself does not provide an image; rather an AO subsystem is incorporated into an existing imaging device, as indicated in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;8-25</span>. AO subsystems have thus far been successfully integrated into three ophthalmic imaging devices: fundus cameras, scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscopes, and the OCT device.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Answers</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;8.1.&#9;<span class="bold">b.</span> With an ordinary slit lamp, the outlines of individual endothelial cells are best seen by viewing the specular reflection of a narrow slit beam at high magnification. A wider field can be viewed using a specular microscope, with a contact optical system to decrease surface reflections.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;8.2.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> Keratometers approximate the refractive power of the cornea by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the radius of curvature of the central cornea and assuming the cornea to be a convex mirror. The formula <span class="italic">D</span><span class="symbol">=</span>(<span class="italic">n–&#173;</span>1)/<span class="italic">r</span> is then used to convert this radius of curvature into an approximate refractive power, where <span class="italic">r</span> is the radius of curvature of the reflective cornea, and <span class="italic">n</span> is the keratomeric refractive index at 1.3375.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;8.3.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> The 1.3375 index of refraction is calculated to compensate for the minus-&#173;powered posterior corneal surface that cannot be mea&#173;sured with the keratometer. Myopic keratorefractive surgery primarily flattens the anterior surface, and therefore the assumed index of refraction is no longer correct. Another prob&#173;lem following myopic keratorefractive surgery is that the extreme center of the cornea is usually flattened substantially more than the annulus mea&#173;sured by the manual keratometer (approximately 3&#160;mm). Both errors &#173;will lead to overestimating the power of the cornea and a hyperopic postoperative result, if not corrected for in the calculation.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;8.4.&#9;The condensing lens images the observer’s entrance pupils as 2 very small discs that fall within the patient’s entrance pupil (along with the image of the ophthalmoscope bulb’s filament, which must not coincide with the images of the observer’s pupils, to avoid obscuring the fundus with reflections from the patient’s cornea). Of all the light the ophthalmoscope shines into the patient’s eye, only the emergent light that passes through &#173;these pupillary images enters the eyes of the observer and is available for viewing the fundus. As &#173;these image discs occupy far less than 1% of the area of the patient’s entrance pupil, and only about 0.1% of the light is reflected from the fundus, the ophthalmoscope “wastes” over 99% of the light that enters the patient’s eye in forming the image vis&#173;i&#173;ble to the observer, requiring a very bright light source.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--question-">&#9;8.5.&#9;<span class="bold">b.</span> With direct ophthalmoscopy, the examiner uses the optics of the patient’s eye as a &#173;simple magnifier to look at the ret&#173;ina. The optics of the normal eye are approximately <span class="symbol">+</span>60 D, so using the formula for a &#173;simple magnifier, the magnification is 60/4, or 15<span class="symbol">×</span>. If the patient’s eye is myopic, a minus lens is dialed in, to overcome the extra plus power “error lens” inside the patient’s eye. &#173;Those 2&#160;lenses create a Galilean telescope effect, increasing magnification and decreasing the field of view. Similarly, the ret&#173;ina of a hyperopic eye &#173;will be magnified less than 15<span class="symbol">×</span> &#173;because of the reverse Galilean telescope effect created by the minus power error lens inside the patient’s eye and the plus lens of the direct ophthalmoscope. Thus, the size of the optic disc &#173;will appear larger (and not smaller) in a myopic eye than in a hyperopic or a normal eye.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--question-">&#9;8.6.&#9;<span class="bold">e.</span> When looking through a small pupil, the observer can improve visualization by narrowing his or her effective interpupillary distance. This can be accomplished by several means. Moving the ophthalmoscope’s mirrors or prisms closer to the observer (the “small-&#173;pupil feature” available on some ophthalmoscopes) decreases the distance between the light paths to the observer’s left and right eyes, effectively narrowing the observer’s interpupillary distance. Moving the ophthalmoscope’s eyepieces farther apart also decreases the distance between the light paths to the observer’s eyes, similarly narrowing the observer’s effective interpupillary distance. Increasing the distance between the observer and the patient decreases the &#173;angle formed by the observer’s eyes and the patient’s eye, thereby allowing the light paths from the observer’s eyes to “squeeze through” a smaller pupil.</p>

An illuminated target is moved, varying the vergence at the tip of the nose cone, until it becomes focused on the reticle of a telescope. This is the case when the “unknown” spectacle lens is exactly neutralizing the vergence that is coming out of the nose cone. The light will then emerge from the spectacle lens with zero vergence (ie, collimated), and the target will be seen in sharp focus by the observer. The telescope magnifies vergence by the square of its power and thus facilitates the detection of zero vergence, increasing the precision of the measurement and reducing the effect of the observer’s accommodation or refractive error. <span class="figure-source-note">(Reproduced from Guyton DL, et al. </span><span class="figure-source-emphasis">Ophthalmic Optics and Clinical Refraction. </span><span class="figure-source-note">Baltimore: Prism Press; 1999.

					<p class="figure-caption"><span class="figure-number">Figure 8-25</span> Basic principle of adaptive optics. The distorted emerging wavefront from the eye, made irregular by aberrations of the cornea and lens, gives a blurred retinal image at the start. The irregularities in the pattern of multiple images of the object produced by a micro-lenslet array allows us to determine what exactly are the distortions produced by the interfering ocular media, and then with a deformable mirror, we can modify the beam accordingly, so as to remove the distortions, which results in a high resolution retinal image. Note that adaptive optics by itself does not provide an image; rather an AO subsystem is incorporated into an existing imaging device, as indicated in red. <span class="figure-source-note">(Courtesy of Christopher Dainty, National University of Ireland, Galway.)</span></p>
