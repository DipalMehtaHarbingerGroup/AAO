			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">Coherence</span> The ability of light to produce interference phenomena.</p>
			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">Diffraction</span> Refers to light “spreading out beyond the edges” of a small aperture or “bending around the corners” of an obstruction, into a region where—&#173;using strictly geometric optics reasoning—we would not expect to see it, and sets a limit on the resolution that can be achieved in any optical instrument. With a circular aperture such as the pupil, for example, the image of a point source of light formed on the retina—&#173;the point spread function (PSF)—in the absence of aberrations, takes the form of alternating bright and dark rings surrounding a bright central spot, the Airy disc, rather than a point.</p>
			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">Geometric scattering</span> Scattering of light by particles that occurs if the particle size is much larger compared to the wavelength of incident light. The interaction of light with the particle is usually sufficiently described by the laws of geometric optics (refraction and reflection). The formation of a rainbow, for example, is sufficiently described by refraction and reflection by raindrops.</p>
			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">Interference</span> Interference reveals the correlation between light waves and occurs when 2 light waves are brought together (superposition of waves), reinforcing each other and resulting in a wave of greater amplitude (ie, <span class="italic">constructive</span> or additive <span class="italic">interference</span>), or subtracting from each other and resulting in a wave of lower amplitude (ie, <span class="italic">destructive</span> or subtractive <span class="italic">interference</span>), depending on their relative phase.</p>
			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">&#173;Laser</span> Initially the acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.</p>
			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">Mie scattering</span> Scattering of light produced by particles whose size is the same order of magnitude as the wavelength of incident light. Mie scattering caused by &#173;water droplets contributes to the white appearance of clouds. Similarly, Mie scattering caused by a cataract accounts for the whitish appearance of the lens &#173;under slit-&#173;lamp examination.</p>
			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">Photometry</span> A mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the &#173;human visual system’s psychophysical response to light. Basically, photometry can be considered a subtype of radiometry that considers the varying sensitivity of the eye to dif&#173;fer&#173;ent wavelengths in the vis&#173;i&#173;ble spectrum.</p>
			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">Polarization</span>  Light is said to be polarized when the orientation of the electric field, as it oscillates perpendicularly to the direction of propagation, is not random. The polarization state can be pictorially represented by the path that the tip of the electric field vector traces with time as viewed along the propagation axis looking &#173;toward the source, and can be linear, circular, or elliptical.</p>
			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">Quantum electrodynamics</span> The quantum theory of the interaction of light and &#173;matter that resolves the wave–&#173;particle confusion. The theory describes most of the phenomena of the physical world—&#173;including all observed phenomena of light—&#173;except for gravitational and nuclear phenomena.</p>
			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">Radiometry</span> Refers to the direct mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of light in any portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. In contrast to the photometric mea&#173;sure&#173;ments, radiometric mea&#173;sure&#173;ments weight equally the energy transmitted at &#173;every wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
			<p class="glossary-entry-last"><span class="glossary-term">Rayleigh scattering</span> Wavelength-&#173;dependent scattering that occurs when light interacts with particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light. The blue appearance of the sky during daytime and its reddish appearance during sunrise or sunset is due to Rayleigh scattering by atmospheric gas molecules. The bluish appearance of the cornea and lens (particularly noticeable in young eyes) &#173;under slit-&#173;lamp examination is also due to Rayleigh scattering by stromal collagen and lenticular fiber cells.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Introduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top3"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The previous discussions of <span class="italic">geometric optics</span> in this book disregard the wavelength and photon character of light. &#173;These discussions work with the artificial construct of light rays and show how light behaves on a large scale compared with the dimensions of interest.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Physical optics</span> goes beyond ray tracings and vergence calculations and deals with the properties of light on smaller scales, providing explanations for many of the phenomena of the physical world, such as <span class="italic">polarization</span>, <span class="italic">coherence</span>, <span class="italic">interference</span>, and <span class="italic">diffraction</span>, for which the ray approximation of geometric optics is insufficient.</p>

			<p class="h1">What Is Light?</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top4"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">
			<p class="h2-h1">Visible Light</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In ophthalmic optics, the term <span class="italic">light</span> generally refers to vis&#173;i&#173;ble light, which is just a very narrow portion of a long scale, analogous to a musical scale, in which &#173;there are “notes” both higher and lower than we can perceive (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-1</span>). The visual perception of &#173;these notes—&#173;specified by <span class="italic">frequency</span> (<span class="greek--tx-">ν</span>) and <span class="italic">wavelength</span> (<span class="greek--tx-">λ</span>) along the “scale” of light (<span class="italic">the electromagnetic spectrum</span>) and related to each other via the “speed of light” (<span class="italic">c</span> <span class="symbol">=</span> <span class="greek--tx-">ν</span><span class="greek-tx-italic CharOverride-1"> </span><span class="greek--tx-">λ</span> <span class="italic">≈</span> 3 <span class="symbol">×</span> 10<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">8</span> m/s in a vacuum)—is what we call (spectral) <span class="italic">color</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the vis&#173;i&#173;ble spectrum is normally considered to run from 400&#160;nm to 700&#160;nm (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;2-1</span>), the bound&#173;aries are not precise. &#173;Under certain conditions, such as with sufficiently intense light, the eye’s sensitivity extends into the infrared and ultraviolet (UV) regions. As another example, in aphakia, without the UV absorption of the natu&#173;ral lens, the ret&#173;ina can detect wavelengths well below 400&#160;nm.</p>
			<p class="h2">Wave or Particle?</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The earliest comprehensive theories on the nature of light &#173;were advanced around the turn of the 17th&#160;&#173;century. In 1690, Christiaan Huygens put forward a <span class="italic">wave theory</span> of light, demonstrating how light waves might superimpose (interfere) to form a wavefront, similar to &#173;water waves (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-2</span>), and travel in a straight line (in accordance with the ray approximation of geometric optics). As such, Huygens’s wave theory covered &#173;little of what we would call physical optics &#173;today and was soon overshadowed by Isaac Newton’s particle viewpoint. Newton suggested that light was made of particles—he called them “corpuscules.” The <span class="italic">particle theory</span> of light took pre&#173;ce&#173;dence and was accepted essentially unchallenged for over a &#173;century.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the early 19th&#160;&#173;century, Thomas Young’s double-&#173;slit experiment appeared to prove the wave-&#173;like be&#173;hav&#173;ior of light, via the observation of bright and dark bands (fringes) upon illumination of a barrier with 2 narrow openings, very similar to the interference pattern that results from the superposition of &#173;water waves. &#173;Later that &#173;century, James Clerk Maxwell formulated light entirely as a wave; that is, as the propagation of electromagnetic waves (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-3A</span>) according to his Maxwell equations. Thus, for many years &#173;after Newton, as interference, diffraction, and other phenomena &#173;were readily explained by waves, the wave model became the dominant theory of the nature of light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, it is now clear that light also exhibits properties of particles, as seen in experiments with instruments that are sensitive enough to detect very weak light. An example of such an instrument is a photomultiplier, which produces “clicks” when light is shone on it. According to the wave theory, &#173;these clicks should become less loud as the intensity of the impinging light is decreased. In real&#173;ity, &#173;these clicks remain equally loud, but decrease in frequency. Thus, light can be thought of as something like raindrops, with each &#173;little “drop” being called a photon.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the early 20th&#160;&#173;century, Albert Einstein postulated light as the sum of individual packets (quanta) of energy, and thus was born the word <span class="italic">photon</span> and the quantum theory of light (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-3B</span>). This influenced the formation of the concept of a <span class="italic">wave–&#173;particle du</span><span class="italic">ality</span> of light, which was not a very satisfactory theory, but rather represented a state of confusion, as to exactly which model to use in each circumstance. Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism (which fails to explain the observations with very dim light falling on photomultipliers) had to be modified to conform with the concepts of <span class="italic">quantum mechanics</span> (essentially a description of the motion of electrons in &#173;matter).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A new theory—&#173;<span class="italic">quantum electrodynamics (QED)</span>—&#173;the quantum theory of the interaction of light and &#173;matter, developed by a number of physicists in 1929 and clarified by Richard Feynman and 2 other physicists, Julian Schwinger and Sin-&#173;Itiro Tomonaga, in 1948, unites Maxwell’s equations of electricity and magnetism with quantum mechanics. It thereby resolves the wave–&#173;particle confusion by stating that light is made of particles, not in the ordinary sense to be able to predict exactly what &#173;will happen in any given experiment, but rather it leaves us with being able to calculate only probabilities of an event.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thus, contrary to what is taught in many ophthalmology and ophthalmic optics textbooks, &#173;there is one theory that explains all the properties of light we know: QED. Note that for most purposes, in practice it suffices to consider the wave-&#173;like be&#173;hav&#173;ior of light (see Fig 2-3A) for phenomena at the macroscopic level, and the &#173;simple quantum-&#173;view of the light (see Fig 2-3B) at the microscopic level, as &#173;will be illustrated.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Quantum Electrodynamics: Unifying Theory of Light</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top5"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Quantum electrodynamics describes most of the phenomena of the physical world, except for gravitational and nuclear phenomena. All &#173;these phenomena can be essentially deduced from 3 basic actions, each of which occurs with a certain probability that can be calculated using the tools of the theory: (1) a photon goes from point to point, (2)&#160;an electron goes from point to point, and (3) an electron emits (or absorbs) a photon. Qualitatively, the theory boils down to photons, which make up the light, &#173;going from one electron to another, and electrons, which make up the &#173;matter, picking up and giving off photons while moving about.</p>
			<p class="h2">Refraction and Reflection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Both refraction (transmission) and reflection are the result of the interaction of light and &#173;matter, that is, of photons with electrons in the atoms and molecules inside the refractive and/or reflective medium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">We learned in Chapter&#160;1 that light changes speed and direction when moving from one medium to another. However, the individual photons do not go slower inside the material. Slowing of the light is caused by the electrons throughout the material scattering the photons, and the degree to which &#173;there is scattering is called the refractive index for that par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar medium. Similarly, light is not reflected off a surface. In real&#173;ity, the photons are scattered by the electrons in the material, the net result of which is the same as if the photon hit and was reflected by only the surface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Here’s what essentially happens during refraction and reflection: a photon arrives from the outside, hits an electron, and is picked up (<span class="italic">absorption</span>) by the electron; the electron continues a bit, and then a new photon is emitted. This dance of photons and electrons is called <span class="italic">scattering</span> of light. Thus, in refracted and reflected light, the photon that emerges from the pro&#173;cess is not the same photon as the one that went in. Thus, the be&#173;hav&#173;ior of light in classical optics reflects the net result rather than the &#173;actual path of the photon, providing a con&#173;ve&#173;nient approximation to describe the phenomena we are familiar with.</p>
			<p class="h2">Scattering</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The scattering of light by an electron in an atom is the phenomenon that accounts for reflection and transmission (refraction) in a medium. Light scattering is also responsible for the vis&#173;i&#173;ble appearance or perception of color and may be divided into 3 regimes—&#173;<span class="italic">Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering,</span> and <span class="italic">geometric scattering</span>—&#173;according to the dimensions of the scattering medium with re&#173;spect to the wavelength of the incident light. Note that the Tyndall effect, a term commonly used in ophthalmology and chemistry for scattering of light by colloidal suspensions, does not describe a separate scattering regime, but rather the effect of the light beam becoming vis&#173;i&#173;ble. For example, normally you cannot see a beam of light in &#173;water or the aqueous humor. Shining a flashlight beam in a glass of &#173;water &#173;after adding a few drops of milk is an excellent demonstration of the Tyndall effect. The milk proteins &#173;will stay suspended in the &#173;water (a colloid suspension), making the beam vis&#173;i&#173;ble. Similarly, if we can see the beam of light in the aqueous humor during slit-&#173;lamp examination, this is an indication of inflammation, in other words an indication resulting from the presence of suspended protein in the aqueous.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Rayleigh scattering</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rayleigh scattering occurs when light interacts with particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light. The degree of this form of scattering varies strongly with wavelength, more precisely, inversely to its fourth power. Therefore, the probability that light &#173;will scatter is much higher for shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies), such as blue light, than for longer wavelengths (lower frequencies), such as red light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The effect of Rayleigh scattering of sunlight on gas molecules that make up the Earth’s atmosphere is what produces the blue appearance of the sky during daytime and its &#173;reddish appearance during sunrise or sunset. This is &#173;because during daytime, when the sun is overhead, the highly scattered blue end of the spectrum that is emitted by the sun reaches your eye from all directions, whereas the weakly scattered redder wavelengths miss your line of sight. At sunrise and sunset, with the sun at the horizon, it is the weakly scattered red end of the spectrum that can still be seen, passing the atmosphere &#173;towards your eyes almost undeviated, while the blue light that is scattered off misses your line of sight.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The bluish appearance of the cornea and lens (particularly noticeable in young eyes) &#173;under slit-&#173;lamp examination is also due to Rayleigh scattering by stromal collagen and lenticular fiber cells.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Mie scattering</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mie scattering is produced by particles whose size is the same order of magnitude as the wavelength of incident light. Unlike Rayleigh scattering, this form of scattering, on average, does not vary strongly with wavelength and tends to be stronger in the forward direction than in any other direction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Mie scattering contributes to the white appearance of clouds. This is &#173;because the &#173;water droplets that make up the cloud are of comparable size to the vis&#173;i&#173;ble wavelengths, so that the probability of being scattered is about identical for the dif&#173;fer&#173;ent wavelengths (or frequencies) in the white sunlight, and the clouds therefore appear to be white.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the eye, age-&#173;related increase in scattering is mostly associated with an increase in Mie scattering by cataract formation, which adds a strong forward, but less wavelength-&#173;dependent, component to the Rayleigh scattering (the predominant scattering component in healthy young eyes). Mie scattering caused by a cataract accounts for the whitish appearance of the lens &#173;under slit-&#173;lamp examination. The increase in forward scattering is what results in decreased contrast of the patient’s ret&#173;i&#173;nal image, and hence increased glare sensitivity.</p>
			<p class="h3">Geometric scattering</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If the particle size is much larger compared to the wavelength of incident light, the interaction of light with the particle is usually sufficiently described by the laws of geometric optics (refraction and reflection). For example, refraction and reflection are sufficient to explain the formation of a rainbow. This is &#173;because raindrops are larger than &#173;water droplets in clouds and can be considered as merely refracting and reflecting the white sunlight from their surfaces. This nicely illustrates how at the macroscopic level, the quantum be&#173;hav&#173;ior of light can be con&#173;ve&#173;niently disregarded.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Phenomena of Light</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top6"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although QED can account for all observed phenomena of light, several macroscopic phenomena of light, such as polarization, coherence, and interference, can completely, and more easily, be explained by Maxwell’s classical theory of electromagnetic waves. In this context, light may therefore be described as a transverse electromagnetic wave, whose oscillating electric and magnetic fields are both perpendicular to each other as well as to the direction that the light travels (see Fig 2-3A).</p>
			<p class="h2">Polarization</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Fundamentals</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As the magnetic field is always perpendicular to and proportional to the electric field, it may be conventionally ignored when considering polarization, so only the electric field need be described for simplicity. The orientation of the electric field, as it oscillates perpendicularly to the direction of propagation, defines the state of polarization. Note that the electric-&#173;field vector, which is shown oriented in a single plane in Figure&#160;2-3A, typically changes rapidly and randomly, resulting in randomly polarized light that is said to be <span class="italic">unpolarized</span>. When the movement of the electric field vector is not random, the light is said to be polarized. Pictorially, the polarization state can be represented by the path that the tip of the electric field vector traces with time as viewed along the propagation axis looking &#173;toward the source (Lissajous figures). Figure&#160;2-3A depicts <span class="italic">linearly polarized light</span>, with the electric field vector being constrained to a single plane; when viewed head-on it traces a single line. In <span class="italic">circularly polarized light,</span> the electric field vector rotates, tracing a corkscrew pattern as the light propagates. Viewed head-on, the pattern mapped out by the tip of the electric-&#173;field vector is a circle. In <span class="italic">elliptically polarized light,</span> which represents a more general case of circular polarization, the electric-&#173;field vector rotates and at the same time changes its amplitude as the light propagates, tracing an ellipse instead of a circle when viewed head-&#173;on.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Polarized light can be produced in a number of ways. One way to produce complete or <span class="italic">partially polarized light</span> is by reflection. Partial polarization, as the name implies, is a mixture of unpolarized and polarized light (linear, circular, or elliptical). Fresnel showed that the polarized component of reflected light tends to be linear, parallel to the interface.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">where <span class="italic">n</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-2">t</span> and <span class="italic">n</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-2">i</span> are the refractive indices of the transmitted and incident media, respectively. At the Brewster &#173;angle, all the <span class="italic">reflected</span> light is linearly polarized, but not all the linearly polarized light is reflected. Consequently, the <span class="italic">transmitted</span> light is a mixture of linearly and randomly polarized (commonly referred to as unpolarized) light—&#173;that is, it is partially polarized.</p>
			<p class="h3">Applications and clinical relevance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ophthalmic applications of polarization are numerous, some of which are discussed briefly &#173;here. Polarizing sunglasses are sometimes useful for reducing glare from reflected sunlight. Reflected light is somewhat polarized parallel to the reflecting surface, and in&#160;most environments, reflecting objects tend to be horizontal. In boating, for example, &#173;sunlight reflected from the &#173;water surface is partially polarized, usually horizontally, as is light reflected from a road surface or from the hood of a car. Even the sky acts as a partial polarizer by means of the scattering properties of air molecules. Accordingly, sunglasses incorporate vertically oriented linear polarizers (polarizing filters) to block the horizontally polarized component of reflected light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several stereopsis tests incorporate the use of linear polarizers. The well-&#173;known Stereo Fly test, for example, displays 2 slightly displaced images that linearly polarize light in perpendicular meridians. The person wears glasses containing linear polarizers, also at right &#173;angles to each other; each eye sees just 1 of the images, thus a single 3-&#173;dimensional (3D) image is perceived by someone with normal 3D or stereoscopic vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Polarized light is used in some ophthalmic instruments, such as the scanning &#173;laser polarimeter (discussed in Chapter&#160;8). The ret&#173;i&#173;nal nerve fiber layer is birefringent, which means that polarized light travels through it at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent speeds depending on &#173;whether the polarization is along or across the fibers. This retardation is linearly related to the thickness of a birefringent medium. Scanning &#173;laser polarimetry employs this effect to determine the thickness of the nerve fiber layer, for glaucoma diagnostic purposes.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Coherence and Interference</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Fundamentals</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Coherence describes the ability of light to produce interference phenomena. Interference reveals the correlation between light waves and occurs when 2 light waves are brought together (superposition of waves), reinforcing each other and resulting in a wave of greater amplitude (ie, <span class="italic">constructive</span> or additive <span class="italic">interference</span>), or subtracting from each other and resulting in a wave of lower amplitude (ie, <span class="italic">destructive</span> or subtractive <span class="italic">interference</span>), depending on their relative phase (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-4</span>). <span class="xref-figure">Figures&#160;2-5</span> and <span class="xref-figure">2-6</span> illustrate the concepts of coherence and interference of light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;2-5</span>, a white light source produces incoherent light, emitting wavefronts of diverse wavelengths and arrangements. However, if incoherent light is passed through a pinhole aperture, <span class="italic">spatial coherence</span> of the light is improved, that is, the resulting wavefronts are more regularly arranged. If spatially coherent light is passed through a narrow-&#173;band filter, selecting a narrow band of wavelengths (we &#173;will discuss &#173;later how &#173;these filters work), <span class="italic">temporal coherence</span> of the light is improved, that is, the resulting wavefronts have the same wavelength, thereby making the light monochromatic. &#173;Laser light is highly coherent. However, as shown &#173;here, coherent light can be produced even without a &#173;laser, but at the expense of discarding a large amount of the light.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;2-6</span> illustrates the basic concept of Young’s double-&#173;slit experiment, discussed earlier. If coherent light strikes a double slit or 2 pinhole apertures, new wavefronts emanate, which then are superimposed on a screen. Note that the curved lines represent the crests of the waves at a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar instant. Where the crests coincide (eg, at A), a maximum of intensity is produced (constructive interference); where the crest of one wave coincides with the trough of the other wave (B) intensity is minimized (destructive interference). An interference pattern of a series of bright and dark fringes is observed on the screen, representing areas of constructive and destructive interference respectively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The concepts of coherence length and coherence time, which are essential in the understanding of the basic princi&#173;ple of optical coherence tomography (OCT; see Chapter&#160;8), can be best understood in the example of interferometry. In interferometry, as illustrated in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;2-7</span>, light is split into 2 beams, and the beam backscattered from a sample is then compared (superimposed) with the beam that has traveled a known time from a reference mirror. Interference between the 2 light beams occurs only when the optical distances traveled by the light in both the sample and reference paths (arms) match to within the coherence length of the light. In other words, c<span class="italic">oherence length</span> is the maximum path difference for good visibility of interference fringes. Likewise, <span class="italic">coherence time</span> is the maximum transit time difference for which interference fringes are still observable.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Both coherence time and length are inversely proportional to the <span class="italic">spectral bandwidth</span> of the light source (ie, the frequency or wavelength range over which sources emit light). Note that a source with a narrow spectral bandwidth (light of nearly a single wavelength or wholly monochromatic; eg, &#173;laser light) has a high temporal coherence, whereas a source with a broad bandwidth (light of multiple wavelengths; eg, white light) has a low temporal coherence (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hence, when a narrow-&#173;bandwidth source is used to perform interferometry (eg, conventional &#173;laser interferometry), interference fringes &#173;will occur over a long range of path length differences between the 2 beams (<span class="xref-vid">Video 2-1</span>). In low-&#173;coherence interferometry—&#173;using a broadband light source—on the other hand, interference occurs only when the time traveled by the light in the reference and sample arms is nearly equal, within the coherence length of the source. Low-&#173;coherence interferometry therefore enables greater sensitivity in separating out reflections, especially when from a sample with multiple, closely spaced reflecting surfaces (<span class="xref-vid">Video 2-2</span>).</p>

			<p class="h3">Applications and clinical relevance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">One familiar application of interference in ophthalmic optics is the use of <span class="italic">antireflection coatings</span> on spectacle lenses (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-9</span>). To decrease unwanted reflections from the surfaces of spectacle lenses, a thin film of a transparent material with a refractive index that is dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from the lens is deposited on the lens surface, so that some light &#173;will be reflected from the back surface and an equal amount &#173;will be reflected at the front surface. &#173;These reflected waves—if the thickness of this deposited film is chosen such that it is one-&#173;quarter of a specified wavelength of light—&#173;will be one-&#173;half wavelength out of phase, resulting in complete destructive interference and therefore eliminating the reflections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The use of <span class="italic">narrow-&#173;band interference filters</span>, such as in fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, as well as autofluorescence imaging (discussed in Chapter&#160;8), is another application of interference in ophthalmology. To produce very sharp bound&#173;aries and separate excitation from fluo&#173;rescent light, a thin film of a transparent material is deposited on a glass substrate, similar to the previous example but this time with a thickness that is a multiple of the desired wavelength and surfaces that are partially reflecting. Multiple reflections of light with the desired wavelength, from the front and back surfaces of this deposited film, &#173;will exit in phase and reinforce each other, whereas light of other wavelengths &#173;will exit out of phase and cancel each other (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-10</span>). Modern narrow-&#173;band filters exist that consist of several thin layers of transparent materials allowing only light of wavelengths within a few nanometers to get transmitted while blocking every&#173;thing &#173;else.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diffraction</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Fundamentals</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If we try to pass light through a very small hole, we &#173;will realize that it actually does not go in a straight line, but rather spreads out. This apparent “spreading out beyond the edges” of an aperture or “bending around the corners” of an obstruction, into a region where—&#173;using strictly geometric optics reasoning—we would not expect to see it, is referred to as <span class="italic">diffraction</span>. Diffraction may be thought of as light, when encountering an obstacle, scattering off in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent directions at the edges. What &#173;really happens, of course, is light interacts with the electrons in the material, most noticeably with the electrons at the edges.</p>
			<p class="body-text">While a more detailed description of diffraction is beyond the scope of this text, we can appreciate that once light scatters off in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent directions, it usually interferes with other parts of the diffracted light. Hence, in classical wave theory, the phenomenon of diffraction of light, as it passes beyond an obstacle of comparable size to its wavelength, is generally described as interference effects of the emerging light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The consequence of &#173;these interference effects created by diffraction on apertures is that it sets a limit on the resolution that can be achieved in any optical instrument, which immediately brings us to applications and clinical relevance in ophthalmology.</p>
			<p class="h3">Applications and clinical relevance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All apertures produce diffraction to some extent, even an opening as large as the pupil of an eye. Thus, we are constantly aware of its effects in ophthalmology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With a circular aperture, such as the pupil, in the absence of aberrations, the image of a point source of light formed on the retina—&#173;the point spread function (PSF)—&#173;takes the form of alternating bright and dark rings surrounding a bright central spot, the Airy disc (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-11</span>), rather than a point. This pattern is the consequence of diffraction and its associated interference effects. The latter are apparent by the concentric bright and dark rings that are analogous to the fringes observed in Young’s double-&#173;slit experiment (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-6</span>). Most of the energy is concentrated in the central disk, so the outer rings are usually ignored. The dia&#173;meter of the Airy disc is given by the equation</p>
			<p class="equation-single ParaOverride-14"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="BCSC1819_S03_C02_p091-122-web-resources/image/Ch02_002.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">where <span class="italic">D</span> is the dia&#173;meter of the aperture (pupil) and <span class="italic">f</span> is the focal length—&#173;the distance from the aperture to the diffracted image. This equation illustrates that longer wavelengths (eg, red light) have a larger Airy disc than shorter wavelengths (eg, blue light) and therefore diffract more. Similarly, diffraction increases as the pupil size decreases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Under photopic lighting conditions, the pupil of the &#173;human eye is around 2–3&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter. With pupil sizes less than that (for a person with emmetropia), diffraction effects become visually significant, limiting visual acuity. For an eye with a 3-&#173;mm-&#173;diameter pupil (and f-&#173;number, that is <span class="italic">f</span>/<span class="italic">D</span>, of about 5), for example, and a 555-nm light source, corresponding to the maximum photopic sensitivity of the ret&#173;ina (see the section Mea&#173;sures of Light), the Airy disc dia&#173;meter is approximately 7.4&#160;µm, encompassing the outer segments of roughly 11 photoreceptors. The smallest resolvable detail is approximately equal to the Airy disc radius. An Airy disc of 3.7 <span class="greek--tx-">μ</span>m radius corresponds roughly to 20/15 visual acuity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thus, in theory, the larger the pupil size, the smaller the Airy disc and therefore better visual acuity or higher resolution of the image on the ret&#173;ina. However, in practice (as discussed in Chapter&#160;8), higher-&#173;order aberrations occur at larger pupil sizes. While &#173;there are ways to correct for wavefront aberrations (adaptive optics, discussed in Chapter&#160;8), we cannot suppress diffraction. It sets an absolute limit on the best resolution obtainable with any optical system, including the eye, and is represented by the Airy disc pattern (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-11</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diffraction can also be used to an advantage in ophthalmic optics, in the creation of bifocal or multifocal lenses. For example, &#173;etching a specially designed pattern of closely spaced circular steps on one of the surfaces of a contact or intraocular lens can cause light to diffract, such that the resulting interference effects of the diffracted light create a second near focal point for the lens, with the overall curvature of the lens si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously providing distance focus.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-15">Measures of Light</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top7"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For many clinicians, the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of light is one of the most confusing topics in the field of clinical optics. This section &#173;will attempt to clarify the subject.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As we learned previously, light is a range of electromagnetic radiant energy, comprising the range of wavelengths to which the eye is ordinarily sensitive—&#173;about 400–700&#160;nm. The mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of light thus naturally derives from more general methods for the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of electromagnetic radiant energy—&#173;specifically, from general methods to mea&#173;sure the <span class="italic">transfer</span> of energy by electromagnetic radiation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Energy is the ability of a system to perform work. Through the insights of physics and thermodynamics, energy is understood to take many forms, including kinetic energy, the energy of objects in motion; potential energy, the energy stored in a system by virtue of its position (such as the height of an object subject to gravity); chemical energy, the potential energy available through chemical reactions; and thermal energy, the energy stored in the temperature of objects. Thus, the units for work and energy are the same—&#173;typically joules (J <span class="symbol">=</span> kg·m<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>/s<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Power is the rate at which energy is transformed or transferred from one form to another. It is mea&#173;sured in units of work (or energy) per unit time, typically joules per second (J/s), or watts (W). Historically, this unit and its multiples have served in most contexts for mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the rate of energy transfer, from the output of a gasoline engine to the energy required to operate a computer micropro&#173;cessor chip. The watt is used without difficulty what&#173;ever the form of the energy transfer, from mechanical devices, to electrical power lines, to heat generation. Derived quantities are described in &#173;simple combinations of units—&#173;for example, the productivity of solar panels might be described in units of power per unit area—&#173;say, W/m<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Radiometry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mea&#173;sure&#173;ments of the power transferred by means of electromagnetic radiation are typically described with derived units in accordance with the above scheme (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;2-2</span>). In princi&#173;ple, the fundamental mea&#173;sure&#173;ment tool for this purpose is the blackbody radiometer. This is an object (frequently realized in the form of a hollow cavity), which absorbs radiant electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths with equal efficiency. The amount of energy absorbed is determined by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the increase in the temperature of the blackbody, and converting heat to energy according to the laws of thermodynamics and knowledge of the heat capacity of the detector, and dividing by the length of time the radiometer was exposed to the radiation. (In practice, radiometers are designed to work only over limited ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, depending on the physics of the detector employed.)</p>
			<p class="body-text">In practice, care must be taken to account for the geometry of the source of the radiation, and for the geometry of the detector. The simplest case is a point source, radiating equally in all directions—&#173;the power output of such a device is appropriately mea&#173;sured simply in watts. But it would be difficult to surround such a point source with a detector, which would si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously absorb the output in &#173;every direction. Typically, <br />the detector &#173;will intercept the radiation over only a small area. In this case (assuming the radiation output to be uniform in &#173;every direction), it would be appropriate to normalize the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment by dividing the energy transfer intercepted by the detector by the solid &#173;angle it subtends (in essence, the area of the detector divided by the distance from the point source), thus reporting the energy output of the point source in watts per steradian (W/sr), with the understanding that multiplying by 4<span class="greek--tx-">π</span> (the total solid &#173;angle of the space surrounding a point) would yield the energy output of the point source, in watts. This description of the energy output from a point source is referred to as its <span class="italic">radiant intensity</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Similarly, if the radiation source is an extended planar object, the appropriate description of its energy output would be in terms of watts per unit area, say W/m<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>. This description of the energy output is referred to as the <span class="italic">radiant exitance</span> of the extended source. If one prefers to mea&#173;sure the rate at which radiant energy impinges on an extended object, the appropriate units are again, W/m<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>, but in this context, the energy transfer is referred to as <span class="italic">irradiance</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Note that “intensity,” depending on the context or the background of the person using the term, can have alternative meanings. In optics and par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar &#173;laser physics, it generally refers to power density (ie, radiometric irradiance) and most commonly is expressed in watts per square centimeter (W/cm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Photometry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Photometry</span> is the modification of the scheme described above so as to reflect the variable sensitivity of &#173;human vision to light of dif&#173;fer&#173;ent wavelengths, in contrast to the radiometric mea&#173;sure&#173;ments, which weight equally the energy transmitted at &#173;every wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This adjustment is based on empirical mea&#173;sure&#173;ments of the relative sensitivity of &#173;human vision to light of the vari&#173;ous wavelengths. This weighting curve is referred to as the <span class="italic">spectral luminous efficiency function</span>, usually denoted by V(<span class="greek--tx-">λ</span>) or V<span class="greek-subscript CharOverride-3">λ</span>. The photometric mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the radiant energy output or input in a system is the summation (or, better, integral) of the energy transfer at each wavelength multiplied by the value of V<span class="greek-subscript CharOverride-3">λ</span> for that wavelength.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Unfortunately, for historical reasons, unlike the case for radiometric mea&#173;sure&#173;ments, the derived units for each geometric variant of this pro&#173;cess for photometric mea&#173;sure&#173;ments have been given dif&#173;fer&#173;ent names, further complicating &#173;these discussions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The photometric equivalent of the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the total radiant output of a point source is the <span class="italic">lumen</span> (lm), the V<span class="greek-subscript CharOverride-3">λ</span>-&#173;weighted version of the watt. This quantity is referred to as the <span class="italic">luminous flux</span>. For example, the output of an ordinary incandescent or light-&#173;emitting diode (LED) light bulb (which can be regarded for most purposes as a point source) is now often indicated in lumens. A 60-&#173;W incandescent bulb might typically have a light output of 800 lumens. (In contrast, an 800-&#173;lumen LED bulb might consume only 12&#160;W of power.)</p>
			<p class="body-text">The photometric equivalent of the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the radiant output of a point source per unit of solid &#173;angle is the <span class="italic">candela</span> (cd), or lm/sr. This quantity is referred to as the <span class="italic">luminous intensity</span> of the point source. For historical reasons, the candela is the primary SI (metric system) unit for the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of light, intended to approximate the light output of the standard wax candles which &#173;were originally used for this purpose. One cd is defined as the luminous intensity of a source emitting monochromatic radiation at a frequency of 540&#160;THz and a radiant intensity of 1/683&#160;W/sr.

			<p class="h2">Conversion Between Radiometric and Photometric Outputs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">So now that we defined the radiometric and photometric mea&#173;sures of light, how do we convert from one to the other? In other words, if a light source has a known radiometric output, can we determine its corresponding photometric output? Yes, if we know the spectral properties of the lamp, that is, the radiometric output at each wavelength. Then, the output at each wavelength is multiplied by the sensitivity of the eye to that wavelength as well as by the conversion &#173;factor that is given by the definition of the candela (according to which &#173;there are 683 lumens per watt for 555-nm light), and the results are summed to obtain the total response of the eye to light from that source.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For example, if a light source has a known output in watts, how much is its output in lumens?

			<p class="h1">Light Sources: Lasers</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top8"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The classical theory of electromagnetic waves successfully explains “macroscopic” light phenomena, but fails to explain phenomena at the atomic and molecular levels. Quantum theory, as illustrated in Figure&#160;2-3B, can explain such phenomena. For the following considerations, it therefore becomes crucial to consider the quantum be&#173;hav&#173;ior of light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">According to quantum theory, electrons in atoms (or molecules) exist in <span class="italic">nonradiating</span> states and each state is associated with a specific energy level. The energy states pos&#173;si&#173;ble for an atom differ from ele&#173;ment to ele&#173;ment, and &#173;those for a molecule differ from compound to compound. Each ele&#173;ment or compound has a unique distribution of energy states. When an electron drops from a higher energy state to a lower one, the difference in energy <span class="italic">(E)</span> is radiated as a packet, called a photon, with a characteristic frequency (<span class="greek--tx-">ν</span>) given by</p>
			<p class="equation-single"><span class="eq--italic-">E</span> <span class="symbol">=</span> <span class="eq--italic-">h</span><span class="greek--tx-">ν</span></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">where <span class="italic">h</span> is the Planck constant. Similarly, an electron can jump to a higher energy state by absorbing a photon, with the resulting energy absorption equal to the energy difference between states (see Fig 2-3B).</p>
			<p class="h2">Fundamentals</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When an electron absorbs a photon and jumps to a higher energy level (<span class="italic">stimulated absorption</span>, see Fig 2-3B), usually it quickly drops back to the original level and emits a photon identical in frequency to the one it absorbed (<span class="italic">spontaneous emission</span>, see Fig 2-3B).</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, atoms of some ele&#173;ments have 2 energy levels that are close together. When a photon is absorbed, the electron jumps to the highest energy level. Instead of dropping back to the original level, the electron first transitions to the slightly lower level without emitting vis&#173;i&#173;ble energy. Next, it drops to the initial energy level and emits a photon. The emitted photon has less energy than the stimulating, absorbed photon and, therefore, a lower frequency, or longer wavelength (and dif&#173;fer&#173;ent perceived color). This phenomenon, called <span class="italic">fluorescence,</span> occurs only in materials possessing close spacing between energy levels. Its clinical utility derives from the essential feature that the absorbed and emitted photons have a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent wavelength and is the basis of fluorescein angiography and macular autofluorescence (discussed in Chapter&#160;8).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In most cases, electrons remain in elevated energy states for very short periods. However, the elevated state is sometimes metastable; that is, the electron may remain in the elevated state for several seconds or longer before dropping back down. Such a pro&#173;cess describes how light is produced by <span class="italic">phosphorescence</span>, which is essentially identical to fluorescence except that the transitions take longer. Light resulting from fluorescence stops immediately &#173;after removal of the exciting energy, whereas light resulting from phosphorescence persists long &#173;after the exciting energy ceases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A photon of appropriate frequency passing near an electron in a metastable state may stimulate the electron immediately to drop to a lower state and radiate an identical photon (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-12</span>). Such <span class="italic">stimulated emission</span> is the basis of the light emission in &#173;lasers. In fact, the word <span class="italic">&#173;laser</span> originated as an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Lasers use an <span class="italic">active medium</span> with an appropriate metastable state. Energy is introduced into the active medium in a variety of ways. For example, <span class="italic">optical pumping</span> uses a bright incoherent light source to excite a large number of electrons into the metastable state. The active medium is inside a <span class="italic">resonator cavity</span>, which typically has a fully reflecting mirror on one end and a partially reflecting one on the other; this design &#173;causes light to make numerous passes through the active medium, producing more and more photons by stimulated emission with each pass (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-13</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Contrary to common belief, &#173;lasers are not very efficient light sources. Compared with the amount of energy required to power a &#173;laser, the amount of energy produced is modest. The light produced, however, has unique and useful characteristics. &#173;Laser light has a very narrow bandwidth (ie, it is nearly a single wavelength or monochromatic) and, consequently, it has high temporal coherence. The coherence length is relatively long—&#173;about half the length of the resonator cavity—&#173;typically a few centimeters. &#173;Lasers are the most intense sources of monochromatic light available.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the total energy in &#173;laser light may be slight, it can be focused on a very small area to produce a very high energy density (ie, energy that is transferred per square centimeter, or fluence; see <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;2-2</span>). &#173;Laser light is also highly directional and, depending on the design of the resonator, may also be polarized.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Lasers are usually named &#173;after their active medium. The medium can be a gas (argon, krypton, carbon dioxide, argon with fluoride [excimer], or helium with neon), a liquid (dye), a solid (an active ele&#173;ment supported by a crystal, such as neodymium: yttrium-&#173;aluminum-&#173;garnet [Nd:YAG] and titanium: sapphire [Ti:Sapphire]), or a semiconductor (diode).</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Lasers may operate continuously (eg, an argon &#173;laser for photocoagulation), commonly referred to as <span class="italic">continuous wave</span>, or in pulses (eg, a Nd:YAG &#173;laser for capsulotomy). Mode-&#173;locking and Q-&#173;switching are 2 common methods of producing a <span class="italic">pulsed</span> output. The details of such methods are beyond the scope of this chapter. Note, however, that while <span class="italic">Q-&#173;switching</span> allows for the production of short pulses (mainly on the order of nanoseconds, ie, 10<span class="symbol-superscript CharOverride-2">−</span><span class="superscript CharOverride-2">9</span>&#160;s), it is <span class="italic">mode-&#173;locking</span> that can produce <span class="italic">ultrashort pulses</span>, with a duration on the order of picoseconds (ie, 10<span class="symbol-superscript CharOverride-2">−</span><span class="superscript CharOverride-2">12</span>&#160;s) or less, depending on the properties of the &#173;laser. In fact, the pulse duration is mainly dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the &#173;laser medium; the larger its spectral bandwidth, the shorter the pulse that can be realized. Thus, ultrashort &#173;laser pulses are not monochromatic, and for the generation of femtosecond pulses, a &#173;laser with a large spectral bandwidth is required. For a Ti:Sapphire &#173;laser with a 128-&#173;THz spectral bandwidth, for example, the shortest pulse that can be created would be around 3.4 femtoseconds (ie, 10<span class="symbol-superscript CharOverride-2">−</span><span class="superscript CharOverride-2">15</span>&#160;s).</p>
			<p class="body-text">We have learned previously that power is the amount of energy delivered in a given time period. A watt is 1 joule of energy delivered over 1 second. The same joule delivered over a nanosecond has a power of 1 billion watts; over a picosecond, 1 trillion watts; and over a femtosecond, 1 quadrillion watts. Pulsing is a way of increasing the power of a &#173;laser’s output by delivering a modest amount of energy over a very short period.</p>
			<p class="h2">Therapeutic &#173;Laser–&#173;Tissue Interactions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The fundamental pro&#173;cess of any therapeutic &#173;laser application is the energy transfer to the tissue via absorption of light, which is a function of the nature of the tissue (its distribution of energy states) as well as the wavelength (photon energy) of the light. Therapeutic laser–&#173;tissue interactions may be divided into 5 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent types (<span class="xref-table">&#173;</span><span class="xref-table">Table&#160;2-5</span>), each of which &#173;will be discussed in detail: <span class="italic">photochemical interaction</span>, <span class="italic">thermal interaction</span>, <span class="italic">photoablation</span>, <span class="italic">plasma-&#173;induced ablation</span>, and <span class="italic">photodisruption</span>. &#173;These mechanisms are primarily determined by the power density (irradiance) of the &#173;laser light and its interaction time (&#173;laser pulse duration) with the tissue. All therapeutic &#173;laser–&#173;tissue interaction mechanisms share a common characteristic, in that all meaningful energy densities (the energy that is transferred to the tissue—&#173;fluence) vary typically between 1 and 1000&#160;J/cm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-14</span>).</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single">Niemz MK. <span class="italic">Laser-&#173;Tissue Interactions: Fundamentals and Applications</span><span class="italic CharOverride-5">.</span> 3rd&#160;ed. New York: Springer; 2007.</p>
			<p class="h3">Photochemical interaction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Photochemical interaction, sometimes referred to as <span class="italic">photoactivation</span>, takes place at long exposure times, ranging from seconds to continuously, and very low power densities or irradiances (typically 1 W/cm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>). This type of interaction is based on the use of a photosensitizing dye (eg, &#173;rose bengal, riboflavin, or verteporfin), which serves as a chemical (electron reaction) catalyst. &#173;Laser irradiation, at a wavelength coupled to the specific dye used, &#173;causes a photochemical reaction only within tissues where the dye is pres&#173;ent and when irradiated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This is for example used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), where a photosensitizing agent is injected into the circulation. The blood vessels are then treated with &#173;laser irradiation to activate the photosensitizer. A chemical reaction occurs, resulting in thrombosis and closure of the blood vessels. Other than ret&#173;i&#173;nal PDT in age-&#173;related macular degeneration (AMD), a specific example of this is the treatment of a vascularized cornea with &#173;rose bengal and green argon &#173;laser irradiation, to thrombose blood vessels and thereby reduce the chance of rejection of a subsequent graft. Another ophthalmic application is the use of ultraviolet-&#173;A (UV-&#173;A) light &#173;after application of riboflavin onto the corneal surface, to promote corneal crosslinking in the treatment of keratoconus.</p>
			<p class="h3">Thermal interaction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">At somewhat shorter exposure times—&#173;ranging from microseconds to a minute—&#173;and higher power densities—&#173;ranging from 10&#160;W/cm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span> to 10<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">6</span> W/cm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>—&#173;diverse thermal effects at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent temperatures may be distinguished (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;2-6</span> and <span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-15</span>). This type of interaction is based on the generation of heat (molecular motion) by the absorption of light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Photocoagulation, which is associated with protein and collagen denaturation, is the most commonly used thermal &#173;laser–&#173;tissue interaction in ophthalmic surgery. Natu&#173;ral chromophores or dyes within the tissue absorb light and convert it to heat, which &#173;causes denaturation. Their absorption strongly depends on the wavelength of incident light. Thus, &#173;laser light of appropriate wavelength must be selected to target specific ocular structures. The main natu&#173;ral chromophores within ocular tissues that are targeted during photocoagulation are hemoglobin (eg, in blood vessels) and melanin (eg, in the iris or deep ret&#173;i&#173;nal layers), which strongly absorb wavelengths from about 400&#160;nm to 580&#160;nm. &#173;Laser wavelengths longer than 500&#160;nm are generally the preferred choice, in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar when treating near or in the macula, as light between 450&#160;nm and 500&#160;nm is strongly absorbed by the yellow xanthophyll pigments in the macula. Formerly, large argon gas-&#173;filled tubes &#173;were used to create green &#173;laser beams (513&#160;nm), but newer solid-&#173;state devices can emit the desired wavelengths, such as frequency-&#173;doubled Nd:YAG (ie, one-&#173;half of the fundamental 1064-nm wavelength of the Nd:YAG &#173;laser, thus 532&#160;nm), or more compact diode &#173;lasers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common ophthalmic applications of photocoagulation include &#173;laser coagulation to prevent ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments, photocoagulation of ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessel disease, panret&#173;i&#173;nal photocoagulation in diabetic retinopathy, transpupillary thermotherapy for malignant choroidal melanoma and choroidal neovascularization in AMD, &#173;laser trabeculoplasty for open-&#173;angle glaucoma, and &#173;laser iridotomy for closed-&#173;angle glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Photocoagulation is also used for photothermal shrinkage of stromal collagen, known as <span class="italic">&#173;laser thermo-&#173;keratoplasty (LTK)</span>, in the treatment of hyperopia. The cornea does not absorb enough vis&#173;i&#173;ble light, even highly concentrated light, to produce a significant temperature increase. However, the cornea is opaque to some infrared wavelengths, thus an infrared &#173;laser (eg, holmium: yttrium aluminum garnet [Ho:YAG]) is used in LTK.</p>
			<p class="h3">Photoablation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If we deliver photons in a short enough time, so that no heat is transferred, and with sufficient energy—&#173;typically in the 5 to 7 electron voltage (1&#160;eV <span class="symbol">~</span> 1.602 <span class="symbol">×</span> 10<span class="symbol-superscript CharOverride-2">−</span><span class="superscript CharOverride-2">19</span>&#160;J) range—&#173;then we can directly split molecules, that is, break their covalent chemical bonds. Excimer &#173;lasers generating photons with wavelengths in the UV range (eg, a 193-nm argon fluoride excimer &#173;laser) are ideally suited for photoablation. This results in ejection of fragments and very clean ablation without necrosis or thermal damage to adjacent tissue. We can think of this type of interaction as “vaporization” without the surrounding thermal effects from <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;2-15</span>. Typical threshold values for this type of interaction are irradiances of 10<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">7</span> to 10<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">8</span> W/cm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span> and pulses in the nanosecond range. Photoablation is used in the cornea, which absorbs UV light below around 315&#160;nm, for refractive surgery of the cornea such as photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and &#173;laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).</p>
			<p class="h3">Plasma-&#173;induced ablation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Under even higher concentrated peak irradiances (but ideally low-&#173;pulse energies compared to photodisruption; see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-14</span>), typically 10<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">11</span> to 10<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">13</span> W/cm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>, and shorter exposure times, in the picosecond and femtosecond range, we can not only break molecules (as during photoablation), but even strip electrons from (ionize) their atoms and accelerate them (“optical breakdown”). The accelerated electrons, in turn, can collide with and ionize further atoms, as illustrated in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;2-16</span>. This pro&#173;cess is called <span class="italic">cascade ionization</span> and leads to a <span class="italic">plasma formation</span>, a highly ionized state. It enables a very clean and well-&#173;defined removal of tissue without any evidence of thermal or mechanical damage. This type of interaction also makes it pos&#173;si&#173;ble to transfer energy to transparent media without the use of UV &#173;lasers, by creating a plasma that is capable of absorbing non-&#173;UV &#173;laser photons. Especially in ophthalmology, transparent tissues like the cornea, which is essentially transparent to wavelengths from about 315&#160;nm to 1400&#160;nm, can be treated with non-&#173;UV &#173;lasers using plasma-&#173;induced ablation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There are secondary mechanical side effects, however, such as the generation of a shock wave (ie, plasma electrons are not confined to the focal volume of the &#173;laser beam) and cavitation &#173;bubbles. But they do not define the global effect upon the tissue in the plasma-&#173;induced ablation pro&#173;cess. Note that this kind of ablation is primarily caused by plasma ionization itself (the dissociation of molecules and atoms), which is distinct from the more mechanical interaction pro&#173;cess called <span class="italic">photodisruption</span> and is what is generally attempted with emerging methods of corneal refractive surgery using femtosecond &#173;lasers (eg, intrastromal ablation or cutting, and formation of the corneal flap).</p>
			<p class="h3">Photodisruption</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">At higher pulse energies (typically 1 to 1000&#160;J/cm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>), and thus higher plasma energies, mechanical side effects become more significant and might even determine the global effect upon the tissue, in which case we refer to the interaction pro&#173;cess as photodisruption.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most impor&#173;tant ophthalmic application of this photodisruptive interaction is posterior capsulotomy using the Nd:YAG &#173;laser. During a photodisruption procedure, it is the mechanical (acoustic) wave and not the &#173;laser light itself (as with plasma-&#173;induced ablation) that breaks the capsule. Since both interaction mechanisms—&#173;plasma-&#173;induced ablation as well as photodisruption—&#173;rely on plasma generation and graphically overlap (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-14</span>), it is not always easy to distinguish between &#173;these 2 pro&#173;cesses. In fact, most lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture sources attribute all tissue effects evoked by ultrashort &#173;laser pulses to photodisruption. However, during photodisruption, the tissue primarily is split by mechanical forces, with shock-&#173;wave and cavitation effects propagating into adjacent tissue, thus limiting the localizability of the interaction zone. In contrast, plasma-&#173;induced ablation is spatially confined to the breakdown region and &#173;laser focal spot, with the tissue primarily being removed by plasma ionization itself. The primary distinguishing pa&#173;ram&#173;e&#173;ter between the 2 interaction pro&#173;cesses is energy density (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-14</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Why ultrashort &#173;laser pulses?</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Per the definition of power (energy per second), the shorter the pulse duration, the higher the power that can be delivered at a given energy. In other words, picosecond or femtosecond (ultrashort) pulses permit the generation of high peak powers with considerably lower pulse energies than nanosecond pulses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another consequence of this is that, for ultrashort pulses, especially in the femtosecond range, considerably lower pulse energies are needed to achieve optical breakdown (plasma generation), and therefore purely plasma-&#173;induced ablation can be observed. For nanosecond pulses, on the other hand, as illustrated in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;2-17</span>, the threshold energy density for optical breakdown is higher, so that purely plasma-&#173;induced ablation is not observed, but is always associated with photodisruption. Since disruptive effects can damage adjacent tissue, ultrashort &#173;laser pulses are generally preferred (depending on the application).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Note that for a &#173;laser with high-&#173;energy pulses (photodisruption regime), causing disruptive effects that propagate beyond its focal spot, lower repetition rates are needed; in contrast, for a &#173;laser with low-&#173;energy pulses (plasma-&#173;induced ablation regime), higher repetition rates are necessary and produce smoother surface cuts without increasing the time of the procedure (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-18</span>).</p>

			<p class="h1">Light Hazards</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top9"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As with any therapeutic light application, nontherapeutic damage to the eye caused by light is primarily dependent on the wavelength as well as the irradiance and time of light exposure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For example, the sun itself produces a power density (irradiance) of about 10&#160;W/cm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span>, which &#173;will rise to 170&#160;W/cm<span class="superscript CharOverride-2">2</span> if that sunlight is focused and falls well within the range of thermal interaction (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-14</span>); in fact, ret&#173;i&#173;nal photocoagulation was first performed by focusing sunlight onto the ret&#173;ina. Similarly, prolonged irradiation or cumulative exposure from the operating microscope or indirect ophthalmoscope through a focusing lens, in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar on the eye with a dilated pupil, may be harmful to the eye. For instance, &#173;there is some evidence that cases of post-&#173;cataract-&#173;extraction cystoid macular edema are related to microscope illumination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The anterior segment of the eye is essentially transparent to wavelengths from about 400&#160;nm to 1400&#160;nm and opaque to light outside that wavelength range, thereby reducing and protecting the subsequent ocular media from direct exposure to UV as well as infrared (IR) light. This is thanks to the crystalline lens essentially blocking UV-&#173;A light (315–400&#160;nm) and the cornea essentially blocking UV-&#173;B (280–315&#160;nm), UV-&#173;C (280&#160;nm and below), as well as IR-&#173;B and IR-&#173;C (1400&#160;nm to 1&#160;mm) radiation. The filtering properties of anterior-&#173;segment components is inherently related to their absorptive capabilities, in case of UV radiation causing breakdown of the absorptive molecules in the cornea and lens, and in case of IR radiation causing a temperature rise and subsequent denaturation of protein in the cornea. Therefore, the anterior segment is not only susceptible to injury from UV irradiation, from which photokeratitis (from short-&#173;term exposure to UV-&#173;B and UV-&#173;C) and cataract (from long-&#173;term cumulative exposure) may result, but also to thermal injury from IR radiation. Damage from thermal injury may be caused from any light above 400&#160;nm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the ret&#173;ina, natu&#173;ral chromophores, including melanin, hemoglobin, and xanthophyll, as previously discussed, strongly absorb wavelengths from about 400&#160;nm to 580&#160;nm. This makes the ret&#173;ina susceptible to photochemical injury in that region, especially from blue light. Note, that in an aphakic eye, this susceptibility to damage extends to below 400 (to about 315&#160;nm) without the UV-&#173;A absorption capability of the natu&#173;ral lens, and is the basis for incorporating UV-&#173;blocking and blue-&#173;blocking chromophores in some intraocular lenses. The ret&#173;ina is also susceptible to thermal injury from optical radiation occurring from the vis&#173;i&#173;ble to near-&#173;infrared wavelengths of 400–1400&#160;nm.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Reconciliation of Geometric Optics and Physical Optics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">We have seen how the basic princi&#173;ples of geometric optics are consequences of Fermat’s princi&#173;ple. In turn, Fermat’s principle can be understood as a consequence of the wave properties of light. Although a rigorous derivation is beyond the scope of this volume, a heuristic description of the concepts can be instructive.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A beam of light propagates as a wave, oscillating perpendicular to the direction of travel. Two such waves that coincide &#173;will interfere with one another. This interference is constructive or destructive, according to &#173;whether the peaks and troughs of the waves coincide (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-6</span>). If 2 coincident waves of light emanate from a common source, their peaks and troughs coincide whenever the travel time of the 2 waves is identical. In this case, the full strength of the light waves is evident. Conversely, if the travel times of 2 coincident waves differ such that the arrival of their peaks and troughs differ by exactly half a wavelength, the waves cancel each other perfectly, and no light appears to be transmitted.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When small variations in the light path occur, pos&#173;si&#173;ble paths for which the travel time is essentially unchanged &#173;will thus contribute strongly to the resultant image, whereas &#173;those paths that vary more strongly in travel time &#173;will essentially cancel out. Paths for which small variations (often referred to as “perturbations”) of the light path have &#173;little effect on travel time are referred to as <span class="italic">extremal</span> paths. The most familiar of &#173;these are the paths of shortest travel time, such as the straight-&#173;line paths of light through uniform media. The formal derivation of &#173;these observations is the concern of the mathematical subject known as the “calculus of variations,” which is beyond the scope of this book.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In rare instances, paths other than &#173;those of shortest travel time may also be extremal and are also permitted by the wave properties of light. One impor&#173;tant example occurs in fiber-&#173;optic light-&#173;guides, which are fabricated with a gradient in the refractive index such that the “densest” material is at the center of each fiber. The path down the center of the fiber takes the longest time of all pos&#173;si&#173;ble nearby light paths, steering the light down the center of each fiber.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Answers</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;2.1.&#9;<span class="bold">d.</span> In general, it suffices to consider the wave-&#173;like be&#173;hav&#173;ior of light for phenomena at the macroscopic level and the &#173;simple quantum-&#173;view of light at the microscopic level. However, the quantum theory of the interaction of light and &#173;matter—&#173;quantum electrodynamics—&#173;explains all the properties of light we know, resolving the wave-&#173;particle confusion.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;2.2.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> The Airy disc is the central portion of a pattern of light and dark rings formed when light from a point source passes through a circular aperture and is diffracted. The size of the Airy disc increases with smaller pupil size (especially pupil dia&#173;meter <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>2.5&#160;mm), longer wavelengths of light, and longer focal lengths. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal conditions such as macular degeneration have no effect on the size of the Airy disc.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;2.3.&#9;<span class="bold">b.</span> Light scattering occurs when small particles suspended in a transparent medium interfere with the transmittance of light and cause photons to deviate from a straight path. Short wavelengths of light are scattered more strongly than are longer wavelengths. Larger particles scatter light more intensely than do smaller particles. In a healthy cornea, the tightly arranged and regularly spaced collagen molecules minimize the effects of scattering. When a cornea becomes edematous, excess fluid in the stroma disrupts the regular collagen structure, causing light scattering.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;2.4.&#9;<span class="bold">b.</span> Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue to ultrasound imaging, using infrared light instead of sound. The much higher speed of light compared with sound allows for finer resolution, but direct electronic mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the shorter “echo” times it takes light to travel from dif&#173;fer&#173;ent structures at axial distances within the eye is not feasible. Interferometry enables us to overcome this difficulty. More precisely, OCT uses interference of broadband or tunable coherent light to generate optical sections of the ret&#173;ina and cornea.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;2.5.&#9;<span class="bold">d.</span> &#173;Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), common refractive surgeries of the cornea, are based on photoablation using excimer &#173;lasers generating photons with wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV) range that are absorbed within the corneal tissue.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;2.6.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> In the ret&#173;ina, natu&#173;ral chromophores strongly absorb wavelengths from about 400&#160;nm to 580&#160;nm, which makes the ret&#173;ina susceptible to photochemical injury in that region, especially from blue light. This susceptibility to damage is increased in an aphakic eye, extending to below 400 (to about 315&#160;nm), without the UV-&#173;A absorption capability of the natu&#173;ral lens, and is the basis for incorporating UV-&#173;blocking and blue-&#173;blocking chromophores in some intraocular lenses.</p>
