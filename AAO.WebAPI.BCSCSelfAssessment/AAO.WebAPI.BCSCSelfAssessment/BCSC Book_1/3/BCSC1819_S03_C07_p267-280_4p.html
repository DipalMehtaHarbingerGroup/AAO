			<div id="Chapt7_Top2"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This chapter provides an overview of the optical considerations specific to keratorefractive surgery. Refractive surgical procedures performed with the intent to reduce refractive errors can be categorized as <span class="italic">corneal</span> (keratorefractive) or <span class="italic">intraocular.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Keratorefractive surgical procedures can be divided into surgical-&#173;removal, surgical-&#173;neutral, and surgical-&#173;addition procedures. Surgical-&#173;removal procedures include photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), &#173;laser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK), epithelial &#173;laser in situ keratomileusis (epi-&#173;LASIK), &#173;laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), and small-&#173;incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). Surgical-&#173;neutral procedures include radial keratotomy (RK), astigmatic keratotomy (AK), &#173;laser thermal keratoplasty (LTK), and radiofrequency conductive keratoplasty (CK). Surgical-&#173;addition procedures include implantation of intracorneal ring segments and corneal inlays. Intraocular refractive procedures include implantation of a phakic intraocular lens (IOL), piggyback lens, and cataract and clear lens extraction with implantation of a monofocal, toric, multifocal, or accommodative intraocular lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although &#173;these refractive surgical techniques alter the optical properties of the eye, keratorefractive surgery is generally more likely than lenticular refractive surgery to induce optical aberrations. This chapter discusses only keratorefractive procedures and their optical considerations. For a discussion of optical considerations in lenticular refractive surgery, see BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Vari&#173;ous optical considerations are relevant to refractive surgery, both in screening patients for candidacy and in evaluating patients with vision complaints &#173;after surgery. The following sections address optical considerations related to the change in corneal shape &#173;after keratorefractive surgery, issues concerning the &#173;angle kappa and pupil size, and the vari&#173;ous &#173;causes of irregular astigmatism.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Corneal Shape</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top3"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A basic premise of refractive surgery is that the cornea’s optical properties are intimately related to its shape. Consequently, manipulation of the corneal shape changes the eye’s refractive status. Although this assumption is true, the relationship between corneal shape and the cornea’s optical properties is more complex than is generally appreciated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The normal &#173;human cornea has a prolate shape (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-1</span>), similar to that of the pole of an egg. The curvature of the &#173;human eye is steepest in the central cornea and gradually flattens &#173;toward the periphery. This configuration reduces the optical prob&#173;lems associated with &#173;simple spherical refracting surfaces, which produce a nearer point of focus for peripheral rays than for paraxial rays—&#173;a refractive condition known as <span class="italic">spherical aberration. Corneal asphericity,</span> the relative difference between the peripheral and central cornea, is represented by the <span class="italic">Q</span> &#173;factor<span class="italic">.</span> In an ideal visual system, the curvature at the center of the cornea would be steeper than at the periphery (ie, the cornea would be prolate), and the asphericity &#173;factor <span class="italic">Q</span> would have a value close to <span class="symbol">−</span>0.50; at this value of negative <span class="italic">Q,</span> the degree of spherical aberration would approach zero. However, in the &#173;human eye, such a <span class="italic">Q</span> value is not anatomically pos&#173;si&#173;ble (&#173;because of the junction between the cornea and the sclera). The <span class="italic">Q</span> &#173;factor for the &#173;human cornea has an average value of <span class="symbol">−</span>0.26, allowing for a smooth transition at the limbus. The &#173;human visual system, therefore, suffers from minor spherical aberrations, which increase with increasing pupil size.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ablative procedures, incisional procedures, and intracorneal rings change the natu&#173;ral shape of the cornea to reduce refractive error. Keratometry readings in eyes conducted before they undergo keratorefractive surgery typically range from 38.0 D to 48.0 D. When refractive surgical procedures are being considered, it is impor&#173;tant to avoid changes that may result in excessively flat (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>33.0 D) or excessively steep (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>50.0 D) corneal powers, which decrease vision quality and increase aberrations. A 0.8 D change in keratometry value <span class="italic">(K)</span> corresponds to approximately a 1.00 D change of refraction. The following equation is often used to predict corneal curvature &#173;after keratorefractive surgery:</p>
			<p class="equation-single"><span class="eq--italic-">K</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">postop</span> <span class="symbol">=</span> <span class="eq--italic-">K</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">preop</span> <span class="symbol">+</span> (0.8 <span class="symbol">·</span> <span class="eq--italic-">RE</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">where <span class="italic">K</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">preop</span> and <span class="italic">K</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">postop</span> are preoperative and postoperative <span class="italic">K</span> readings, respectively, and <span class="italic">RE</span> is the refractive error to be corrected at the corneal plane. For example, if a patient’s preoperative keratometry readings are 45.0 D (steepest meridian) and 43.0 D (flattest meridian), then the average <span class="italic">K</span> value is 44.0 D. If the amount of refractive correction at the corneal plane is <span class="symbol">−</span>8.50 D, then the predicted average postoperative <span class="italic">K</span> reading is 44.0 <span class="symbol">+</span> (0.8 <span class="symbol">×</span> <span class="symbol">−</span>8.50) <span class="symbol">=</span> 37.2 D, which is acceptable.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ratio of dioptric change in refractive error to dioptric change in keratometry approximates 0.8:1 owing to the change in posterior corneal surface power &#173;after excimer ablation. The anterior corneal surface produces most of the eye’s refractive power. In the Gullstrand model eye (see &#173;Table&#160;3-1), the anterior corneal surface has a power of <span class="symbol">+</span>48.8 D and the posterior corneal surface has a power of <span class="symbol">−</span>5.8 D, so the overall corneal refractive power is <span class="symbol">+</span>43.0 D. Importantly, standard corneal topography instruments and keratometers do not mea&#173;sure corneal power precisely &#173;because they do not assess the posterior corneal surface. Instead, &#173;these instruments estimate total corneal power by assuming a constant relationship between the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces. This constancy is disrupted with surgical removal or surgical addition procedures, causing a change in the effective refractive index of the cornea. For example, &#173;after myopic excimer surgery, the anterior corneal curvature is flattened. At the same time, the posterior corneal surface remains unchanged or, owing to the reduction in corneal pachymetry and weakening of the cornea, the posterior corneal surface may become slightly steeper than the preoperative posterior corneal curvature, increasing its negative power.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The removal of even a small amount of tissue (eg, a few micrometers) during keratorefractive surgery may cause a substantial change in refraction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-2</span>). The Munnerlyn formula approximates the depth of the ablation based on the optical zone and the refractive correction:</p>

Intracorneal rings flatten the corneal surface to correct myopia while arcuate incisional procedures cause localized flattening to reduce myopic astigmatism. LTK and CK cause focal stromal contraction and central steepening, correcting hyperopia. Fi&#173;nally, pinhole corneal inlays, like the KAMRA corneal inlay (AcuFocus Inc, Irvine, CA), do not change the shape but increase depth of focus on the ret&#173;ina by decreasing the size of the entrance pupil.</p>

			<p class="h1">Angle Kappa</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top4"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As discussed in Chapter&#160;3, the pupillary axis is the imaginary line that is perpendicular to the corneal surface and passes through the midpoint of the entrance pupil (see Fig&#160;3-3). The visual axis is the imaginary line that connects the point of fixation to the fovea. The &#173;angle kappa (<span class="greek CharOverride-2">κ</span>) is defined as the &#173;angle between the pupillary axis and the visual axis (which intersects the corneal surface very near the corneal apex in a regular cornea) and is mea&#173;sured by observing the difference between the apparent center of the pupil and the penlight reflex during monocular fixation of the light source. A large &#173;angle kappa results from a significant difference between &#173;these two. If the &#173;angle kappa is large, centering an excimer ablation over the geometric center of the cornea &#173;will effectively result in a decentered ablation. This can be particularly problematic in a hyperopic correction, in which a large &#173;angle kappa can result in a refractively significant “second corneal apex,” causing monocular diplopia and decreased quality of vision. A large &#173;angle kappa must be identified before surgery to reduce the likelihood of a poor visual outcome.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Pupil Size</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top5"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pupil size mea&#173;sure&#173;ment has been an impor&#173;tant &#173;factor in preoperative evaluations, prompted by observations that some patients with large pupils (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>8&#160;mm) reported difficulties with night vision &#173;after undergoing keratorefractive surgery. Typical symptoms included the appearance of glare, starbursts, and halos; decreased contrast sensitivity; and poor overall quality of vision. Night-&#173;vision prob&#173;lems tended to occur in patients with both large pupils and small treatment zones (<span class="symbol">≤</span>6&#160;mm). The algorithms used in third-&#173;generation &#173;lasers, however, incorporate larger optical and transition zones, enabling surgeons to perform refractive procedures on patients with larger pupils. Use of &#173;these algorithms has dramatically decreased the incidence and severity of night-&#173;vision prob&#173;lems.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many surgeons use default ablation zones during excimer procedures. The accepted standard transition zone between ablated and unablated cornea is 0.5–1.0&#160;mm larger than the pupil; use of this zone helps minimize night-&#173;vision prob&#173;lems. To conserve corneal tissue, smaller optical zones are typically used in higher myopic corrections. In patients who require such corrections, the incidence of night-&#173;vision prob&#173;lems increases in part &#173;because of the mismatch between the size of the pupil and that of the optical zone. Modern transition zones aim to minimize this mismatch.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with extremely large pupils (<span class="symbol">≥</span>8&#160;mm) should be identified and counseled about the potential for increased risk of complications. Spherical aberration may be increased in &#173;these patients. Clinical management of postoperative night-&#173;vision prob&#173;lems includes the use of a miotic such as brimonidine (0.2%) or pilocarpine (0.5%–1%).</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Irregular Astigmatism</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top6"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The treatment of postoperative irregular corneal astigmatism is a substantial challenge in refractive surgery. The diagnosis of irregular astigmatism is made by meeting clinical and imaging criteria: loss of spectacle best-&#173;corrected vision but preservation of vision with the use of a gas-&#173;permeable contact lens, coupled with topographic corneal irregularity. An impor&#173;tant sign of postsurgical irregular astigmatism is a refraction that is inconsistent with the uncorrected visual acuity. For example, consider a patient who has <span class="symbol">−</span>3.50 D myopia with essentially no astigmatism before the operation. &#173;After keratorefractive surgery, the patient has an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/25 but a refraction of <span class="symbol">+</span>2.00 <span class="symbol">−</span>3.00 <span class="symbol">×</span> 60. Ordinarily, such a refraction would be inconsistent with an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/25, but it can occur in patients who have irregular astigmatism &#173;after keratorefractive surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another impor&#173;tant sign is the difficulty of determining axis location during manifest refraction in patients with a high degree of astigmatism. Normally, determining the correcting cylinder axis accurately in a patient with significant cylinder is easy; however, patients with irregular astigmatism &#173;after keratorefractive surgery often have difficulty choosing an axis. Automated refractors may identify high degrees of astigmatism that are rejected by patients on manifest refraction. &#173;Because their astigmatism is irregular (and thus has no definite axis), &#173;these patients may achieve almost the same visual acuity with high powers of cylinder at vari&#173;ous axes. Streak retinoscopy often demonstrates irregular “scissoring” in patients with irregular astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Typically, an AK incision &#173;will decrease regular astigmatism while maintaining the spherical equivalent (coupling); however, results of astigmatic enhancements can be unpredictable for patients with irregular astigmatism. For example, a surgeon may be tempted to perform an astigmatic enhancement on a patient who had &#173;little preexisting astigmatism but significant postoperative astigmatism despite good uncorrected visual acuity. In such cases, the astigmatic enhancement may cause the axis to change dramatically without substantially reducing cylinder power due to irregular astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Irregular astigmatism can be quantified in much the same way as is regular astigmatism. We think of regular astigmatism as a cylinder superimposed on a sphere. Irregular astigmatism, then, can be thought of as additional shapes superimposed on cylinders and spheres. This corneal irregularity is then mea&#173;sured and quantified by wavefront analy&#173;sis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Application of Wavefront Analy&#173;sis in Irregular Astigmatism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Refractive surgeons derive some benefit from having a thorough understanding of irregular astigmatism, for 2 reasons. First, keratorefractive surgery may lead to visually significant irregular astigmatism in a small percentage of cases. Second, keratorefractive surgery may also be able to treat it. For irregular astigmatism to be studied effectively, it must be described quantitatively. Wavefront analy&#173;sis is an effective method for such descriptions of irregular astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An understanding of irregular astigmatism and wavefront analy&#173;sis begins with stigmatic imaging. A stigmatic imaging system brings all the rays from a single object point to a perfect point focus. According to the Fermat princi&#173;ple, a stigmatic focus is pos&#173;si&#173;ble only when the time required for light to travel from an object point to an image point is identical for all the pos&#173;si&#173;ble paths that the light may take.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An analogy to a footrace is helpful. Suppose that several runners si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously depart from an object point (A). Each runner follows a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent path, represented by a ray. In this case, all the runners travel at the same speed on the ground, but slow down when &#173;running through &#173;water. Similarly, light rays &#173;will travel at the same speed in air but slow down in the lens. If all the runners reach the image point (B) si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously, the “image” is stigmatic. If the rays do not meet at point B, then the “image” is astigmatic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Wavefront analy&#173;sis is based on the Fermat princi&#173;ple. Construct a circular arc centered on the paraxial image point and intersecting the center of the exit pupil (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-4A</span>). This arc is called the <span class="italic">reference sphere.</span> Again, consider the analogy of a footrace, but now think of the reference sphere (rather than a point) as the finish line. If the image is stigmatic, all runners starting from a single point &#173;will cross the reference sphere si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously. If the image is astigmatic, the runners &#173;will cross the reference sphere at slightly dif&#173;fer&#173;ent times (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-4B</span>). The <span class="italic">geometric wavefront</span> is analogous to a photo finish of the race. It represents the position of each runner shortly &#173;after the fastest runner crosses the finish line. The <span class="italic">wave</span><span class="italic">front aberration</span> of each runner is the time at which the runner finishes minus the time of the fastest runner. In other words, it is the difference between the reference sphere and the wavefront. When the focus is stigmatic, the reference sphere and the wavefront coincide, so that the wavefront aberration is zero.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another interpretation of the Fermat princi&#173;ple is the point spread function produced by all rays that traverse the pupil from a single object point. This image is perpendicular to the geometric wavefront shown in Figure&#160;7.5B. For example, keratorefractive surgery for myopia using surgical removal procedures reduces spherical refractive error and regular astigmatism, but it does so at the expense of increasing spherical aberration and irregular astigmatism (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-5</span>). The cornea subsequently becomes less prolate, and its shape resembles an egg lying on its side. The central cornea becomes flatter than the periphery and results in an increase in the spherical aberration of the treated zone. Generally, keratorefractive surgery moves the location of the best focus closer to the ret&#173;ina but, at the same time, makes the focus less stigmatic. Such irregular astigmatism leads to decreased contrast sensitivity and underlies many visual complaints &#173;after refractive surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Wavefront aberration is a function of pupil position. For example, coma is a partial deflection of spherical aberration. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;7-6</span> shows some typical wavefront aberrations. Myopia, hyperopia, and regular astigmatism can be expressed as wavefront aberrations. Myopia produces an aberration that optical engineers call <span class="italic">positive defocus.</span> Hyperopia is called <span class="italic">negative defocus.</span> Regular (cylindrical) astigmatism produces a wavefront aberration that resembles a &#173;saddle. Defocus (myopia and hyperopia) and regular astigmatism constitute the lower-&#173;order aberrations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When peripheral rays focus in front of more central rays, the effect is termed <span class="italic">spherical aberration.</span> Clinically, spherical aberration is one of the main &#173;causes of night myopia following LASIK and PRK. &#173;After keratorefractive surgery, corneas that become more oblate (&#173;after myopic correction) &#173;will induce more-&#173;negative spherical aberration, while &#173;those that become more prolate (&#173;after hyperopic correction) &#173;will induce more-&#173;positive spherical aberration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another impor&#173;tant aberration is <span class="italic">coma.</span> In this aberration, rays at one edge of the pupil cross the reference sphere first; rays at the opposite edge of the pupil cross last. The effect is that the image of each object point resembles a comet with a tail (one meaning of the word <span class="italic">coma</span> is “comet”). It is commonly observed in the aiming beam during ret&#173;i&#173;nal &#173;laser photocoagulation; if the ophthalmologist tilts the lens too far off-&#173;axis, the aiming beam spot becomes coma &#173;shaped. Coma also arises in patients with decentered keratorefractive ablation or keratoconus. &#173;These situations may be treatable with intrastromal rings.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Higher-&#173;order aberrations tend to be less significant than lower-&#173;order aberrations, but the higher-&#173;order ones may worsen in diseased or surgically altered eyes. For example, if interrupted sutures are used to sew in a corneal graft during corneal transplant, they &#173;will produce higher-&#173;order, trefoil or tetrafoil aberrations. &#173;These can then be addressed with suture removal, suture addition, or AK. Also, in the manufacture of IOLs, the lens blank is sometimes improperly positioned on the lathe; such improper positioning can also produce higher-&#173;order aberrations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Optical engineers have found approximately 18 basic types of astigmatism, of which only some—&#173;perhaps as few as 5—&#173;are of clinical interest. Most patients prob&#173;ably have a combination of all 5 types.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Wavefront aberrations can be represented in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ways. One approach is to show them as 3-&#173;dimensional shapes. Another is to represent them as contour plots. Irregular astigmatism can be described as a combination of a few basic shapes, just as conventional refractive error represents a combination of a sphere and a cylinder.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Currently, wavefront aberrations are specified by <span class="italic">Zernike polynomials,</span> which are the mathematical formulas used to describe wavefront surfaces. <span class="italic">Wavefront aberration surfaces</span> are graphs generated using Zernike polynomials. &#173;There are several techniques for mea&#173;sur&#173;ing wavefront aberrations clinically. The most popu&#173;lar is based on the <span class="italic">Hartmann-&#173;Shack wavefront sensor,</span> which uses a low-&#173;power &#173;laser beam focused on the ret&#173;ina. A point on the ret&#173;ina then acts as a point source. In a perfect eye, all the rays would emerge in parallel and the wavefront would be a flat plane; however, in most eyes, the wavefront is not flat. Within the sensor is a grid of small lenses (lenslet array) that samples parts of the wavefront. The images formed are focused onto a charge-&#173;coupled-&#173;device chip, and the degree of deviation of the focused images from the expected focal points determines the aberration and thus the wavefront error (eg, see Fig 1-1&#160;in BCSC Section&#160;13, <span class="italic">Refractive Surgery</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most frequently used technologies &#173;today are &#173;those based on mea&#173;sur&#173;ing wavefront aberrations via a ray-&#173;tracing method that proj&#173;ects detecting light beams sequentially rather than si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously, using a Hartmann-&#173;Shack wavefront sensor, further improving the resolution of wavefront aberration mea&#173;sure&#173;ments. The application of Zernike polynomials’ mathematical descriptions of aberrations to the &#173;human eye is less than perfect, however, and alternative methods, such as Fourier transform, are being used in many wavefront aberrometers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To normalize wavefront aberration mea&#173;sure&#173;ments and improve postoperative visual quality in patients undergoing keratorefractive surgery, ophthalmologists are developing technologies to improve the accuracy of higher-&#173;order aberration mea&#173;sure&#173;ments and treatment by using “flying spot” excimer &#173;lasers. Such &#173;lasers use small spot sizes (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>1-mm dia&#173;meter) to create smooth ablations, addressing the minute topographic changes associated with aberration errors.</p>

			<p class="h2">&#173;Causes of Irregular Astigmatism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Irregular astigmatism may be pres&#173;ent before keratorefractive surgery; it may be caused by the surgery; or it may develop postoperatively. Preoperative &#173;causes include keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, contact lens warpage, significant dry eye, corneal injury, microbial keratitis, and epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-7</span>). All &#173;these conditions should be identified before surgery. Common intraoperative &#173;causes include decentered ablations and central islands, and, less commonly, poor &#173;laser optics, nonuniform stromal bed hydration, and LASIK flap complications (a thin, torn, irregular, incomplete, or buttonhole flap; folds or striae of the flap; and epithelial defects). Postoperative &#173;causes of irregular astigmatism include flap displacement, diffuse lamellar keratitis and its sequelae, flap striae, posterior corneal ectasia, irregular wound healing, dry eye, and flap edema.</p>

			<p class="h1">Conclusion</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top7"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Understanding and incorporating optical considerations into the treatment of patients undergoing keratorefractive surgery is impor&#173;tant to enhance the visual results. Patient dissatisfaction &#173;after surgery, albeit rare, often stems from the subjective loss of visual acuity or quality, the source of which can usually be identified through a sound understanding of how keratorefractive surgery alters the optics of the eye. A good understanding of key par&#173;ameters such as corneal shape, pupil size, the ocular surface, spherical and astigmatic errors, higher-&#173;order aberrations, &#173;laser centration and the &#173;angle kappa, and irregular corneal astigmatism can help optimize visual outcomes for keratorefractive surgery.</p>
