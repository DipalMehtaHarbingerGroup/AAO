			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">Bioptic telescope</span> Spectacle-&#173;mounted devices that are typically placed above the visual axis for spotting distance targets, such as traffic lights in jurisdictions where bioptic driving is allowed.</p>
			<p class="glossary-entry"><span class="glossary-term">Charles Bonnet syndrome</span> A condition in individuals who have some degree of vision loss that is characterized by vivid recurrent hallucinations and insight that what is being seen is not real. Individuals may see patterns or formed images such as &#173;people, &#173;faces, or landscapes. The degree of vision loss may be moderate or severe, and the vision loss can be acuity loss or visual field loss due to ocular or neurologic disease.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Approach to the Patient With Low Vision</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top3"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In 2012, an estimated 4,195,966 Americans aged 40 and older &#173;were reported to have vision impairment and blindness—2.9 million individuals had less than 20/40 visual acuity and 1.3 million &#173;were estimated to be legally blind, with best-&#173;corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or less or a visual field of 20° or less around fixation. Most of &#173;these individuals &#173;were el&#173;derly, as prevalence of vision loss increases with age. Vision loss impacts patient safety, in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dence, quality of life, and psychosocial well-&#173;being. Se&#173;niors with vision loss are at risk for falls, injuries, medi&#173;cation errors, nutritional decline, social isolation, and depression at far higher rates than reported for sighted individuals.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist is in a unique position to support patients with vision loss by “recognizing and responding”: recognizing that vision loss, even moderate vision loss, impacts patients’ ability to successfully accomplish the &#173;things they need and want to do, and responding by facilitating access to vision rehabilitation ser&#173;vices. Although the ophthalmologist may not personally provide &#173;these ser&#173;vices, appreciation of the strategies and options in the vision rehabilitation “toolbox” allows you to understand why referring patients to such ser&#173;vices is impor&#173;tant and beneficial, and to provide specific examples to your patients of what vision rehabilitation can offer. In addition, your empathy in recognizing a patient’s reaction to vision loss, &#173;whether it be fear, anger, or sadness, and conveying that you understand the connection of their emotion to their loss, can be a brief, but impor&#173;tant step in the continuum of care, from diagnosis to rehabilitation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any patient with eye disease that cannot be improved with medical or surgical treatment, and who is not able to successfully accomplish necessary visual tasks is a candidate for vision rehabilitation. Prac&#173;ti&#173;tion&#173;ers frequently err in referring only patients with severe vision loss for vision rehabilitation. In fact, rehabilitation can be very impor&#173;tant even for patients with good acuity and eye disease that is associated with scotomas or with reduced contrast perception, such as patients receiving injections for exudative macular degeneration who may still have quite good visual acuity. The Acad&#173;emy’s Preferred Practice Pattern Guideline <span class="italic">Vision Rehabilitation for Adults</span> recommends that patients with acuity less than 20/40, contrast sensitivity loss, and peripheral or central field loss be referred for low vision evaluation. Ophthalmologists are encouraged to ask patients what tasks they are having difficulty &#173;doing &#173;because of their decreased vision. Patients whose only difficulty is reading fine print can usually be assisted by routine eye-&#173;care ser&#173;vices; however, when low vision impacts activities beyond the ability to read fine print, the many practical options of vision rehabilitation are useful.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A strategy for comprehensive vision rehabilitation begins with a low vision evaluation and is followed, as indicated, by training and referral to resources and specialized ser&#173;vices.</p>
			<p class="reference--non-journal--single ParaOverride-5">Prevent Blindness Amer&#173;i&#173;ca. Vision prob&#173;lems in the U.S. Available at <a href="http://www.visionproblemsus.org"><span class="Hyperlink">www.visionproblemsus.org</span></a>. Accessed November&#160;5, 2017.</p>
			<p class="h2">Low Vision Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The low vision evaluation includes a history, mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of visual function, and creation of a vision rehabilitation plan. In contrast to an ophthalmic examination, in which visual function and ocular status are evaluated with the intent to diagnose and treat, the evaluation of the patient seeking vision rehabilitation aims to assess and address reading, valued activities of daily living, patient safety, continued participation despite vision loss, and psychosocial well-&#173;being.</p>
			<p class="h3">Patient history</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As with other clinical encounters, the history provides impor&#173;tant information that directs the remainder of the examination. The low vision history focuses on the limitations the patient’s vision imposes on their function: what they are having difficulty &#173;doing.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Ocular history</span> The disease, rate of progression, and previous ocular treatments &#173;will typically correlate with the patient’s functional complaints. For example, patients with macular degeneration would be anticipated to have dif&#173;fer&#173;ent difficulties than patients with slowly progressive glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">General history</span> The current living situation, supports, employment, hobbies, illnesses, and use of glasses, devices, cell phones, and computers are all relevant issues in the history. Systemic diseases can impact rehabilitation interventions, such as when arthritis or tremors impair a patient’s ability to hold a book or a handheld magnifier.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Patient’s subjective report of difficulties or goals</span> The patient’s goals and values help direct and prioritize rehabilitation efforts. Tasks may still be difficult &#173;after rehabilitation, but patients highly value success in accomplishing tasks that are impor&#173;tant to them. The examiner should ask the patient about difficulties with (1) reading tasks, such as reading newspapers, mail, and handwritten notes; (2) activities of daily living, such as shopping, cooking, using a cell phone or computer, shaving, and watching tele&#173;vi&#173;sion; (3) safety issues, including falls, reading medi&#173;cations, and kitchen safety; (4) barriers to participation, including driving status, transportation alternatives, and isolation; and (5) psychosocial status, such as anx&#173;i&#173;eties, including worry about visual hallucinations experienced and depressive symptoms, and concerns about responsibilities, such as financial or caregiving responsibilities.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Charles Bonnet syndrome</span> Patients with Charles Bonnet syndrome see images of objects that are not real. The condition affects up to one-&#173;third of visually impaired persons. Patients are often relieved to discuss their hallucinations. They may see vivid, recurrent formed images of patterns, such as wall&#173;paper or barbed wire, or even images such as &#173;people or landscapes. Many patients are puzzled by this symptom. Some are anxious, as they do not understand what they are experiencing, and a small proportion are very upset. Most patients &#173;will not report the hallucinations &#173;unless the clinician inquires, for fear of being labeled as mentally unwell.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A diagnosis of Charles Bonnet syndrome can be made if the patient has 4 clinical characteristics: (1) vivid recurrent hallucinations; (2) some degree of vision loss; (3) insight into the unreality of the images, when it is explained to them; and (4) no other neurologic or psychiatric diagnosis to explain the hallucinations. Charles Bonnet syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion, and patients should be referred for neurologic or psychiatric evaluation if they have any other neurologic signs or symptoms (see BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Assessment of Visual Function</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As in ophthalmology in general, visual acuity is an impor&#173;tant and common mea&#173;sure of visual function in vision rehabilitation, as the task per&#173;for&#173;mance of a person with 20/70 visual acuity &#173;will likely differ from that of someone with 20/400 visual acuity. Other mea&#173;sures of visual function, however, are also impor&#173;tant, especially contrast sensitivity and central visual field. Two patients with 20/40 visual acuity, for example, may have dif&#173;fer&#173;ent contrast perception and dif&#173;fer&#173;ent central visual field, and have very dif&#173;fer&#173;ent reading per&#173;for&#173;mance and require dif&#173;fer&#173;ent devices and training. In some disease settings, such as glaucoma or &#173;after stroke, peripheral visual field &#173;will also be impor&#173;tant.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Visual acuity</span> Accurate visual acuity mea&#173;sure&#173;ments can be made to very low levels. Charts can be brought to closer-&#173;than-&#173;standard viewing distances. An ETDRS chart is commonly used at 1 or 2&#160;m (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-1</span>). For patients with very poor vision, the Berkeley Rudimentary Vision Assessment, a set of 25-cm cards held at 25&#160;cm, is available for quantifying visual acuity as low as 20/16,000. Care is taken to carefully mea&#173;sure acuity in patients with low vision by optimizing the refraction, allowing patients adequate time to respond, and often using dif&#173;fer&#173;ent testing distances.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Fixation</span> Patients with normal vision fixate a visual acuity chart with their fovea (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-2</span>). Patients with macular disease may fixate with eccentric areas of the ret&#173;ina, or preferred ret&#173;i&#173;nal loci (PRLs; <span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-3</span>). Visual acuity can vary when using areas of differing ret&#173;i&#173;nal sensitivity. Clues to understanding fixation be&#173;hav&#173;ior include head and eye movement, patient subjective reports, and mea&#173;sured fixation with macular microperimetry.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-7">Crossland MD, Culham LE, Kabanarou SA, Rubin GS. Preferred ret&#173;i&#173;nal locus development in patients with macular disease. <span class="italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2005;112(9):1579–1585.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Refraction</span> The goal of refraction for patients with low vision is to check for significant uncorrected refractive errors; however, only about 10% of low vision patients &#173;will benefit from alternate refractive correction, as the source of their poor vision is typically ocular disease, not refractive error. The vision rehabilitation clinician must temper unreasonable expectations, such as the expectation that new glasses can solve vision prob&#173;lems associated with the eye disease, and ensure that patients do not deplete their financial resources on spectacles that offer &#173;little benefit, especially when they could put that money &#173;toward other devices that significantly improve function. Purchase of new glasses is often best delayed &#173;until the patient can compare the benefit of other rehabilitation options and devices to the benefit of spectacles.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Specific strategies can assist the low vision refraction including using a trial frame, retinoscopy at a shorter distance with greater working-&#173;distance lens power, using a <span class="symbol">+</span>1.00/–1.00 cross cylinder for patients with poorer acuity to allow them to appreciate the differences between choices, or using an automated refractor. The vision rehabilitation clinician watches for fluctuating acuity in diabetic patients and balance corrections in an eye that may now be the better-&#173;seeing eye. Full corrections, rather than balance corrections, are encouraged. Polycarbonate lenses can be considered for ocular safety. It is not uncommon that patients with macular disease have very small areas of foveal ret&#173;ina surrounded by dense scotoma: foveal-&#173;sparing scotomas (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-4A</span>). This is seen in both dry and treated wet macular degeneration, Stargardt disease, and other macular diseases. Such patients may be unable to read the larger letters on a visual acuity chart, causing the examiner to abandon the testing and rec&#173;ord very low acuity. More careful testing, or testing at a closer distance, however, may reveal that the patient can in fact discern smaller letters when he or she is able to align the limited central field with the targets on the eye chart (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-4B</span>).</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Contrast sensitivity</span> The ability to discern contrast is a separate visual function from visual acuity, and the functions are not directly correlated. Patients with poor contrast sensitivity have difficulty seeing the edges of steps, reading light-&#173;colored print, driving in foggy or snowy conditions, and recognizing &#173;faces. Contrast sensitivity varies with target size (spatial frequency), and the relationship between contrast threshold and spatial frequency may be displayed as a contrast sensitivity curve (see BCSC Section&#160;3 Chapter&#160;3). Formal tests of contrast sensitivity include paper charts and computer tests, the &#173;later allowing greater testing range. Paper charts may test a range of spatial frequencies (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-5A</span>), or a single spatial frequency (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-5B</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients whose visual impairment includes loss of contrast sensitivity may benefit from illuminated magnifiers or electronic magnification, and nonoptical strategies, such as task lighting, or modification of contrast in tasks, such as using a black felt-&#173;tip marker.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Central visual field</span> The largest group of patients referred for vision rehabilitation are patients with central field loss due to age-&#173;related macular degeneration (AMD). Traditional field testing with Goldmann or Humphrey perimeters maps the visual field relative to a central fixation point. This is accurate in patients with stable central fixation, but results can be misleading in patients with unstable or eccentric fixation. Defects can be under-&#173; or overrepresented or displaced. Other nonautomated testing methods, such as Amsler grids, cannot assess fixation and &#173;will not detect approximately half of central or paracentral scotomas due to perceptual completion, or “filling in.” The macular microperimeter monitors fundus location and then determines the patient’s direction of gaze before each target is presented. Macular microperimetry (also called <span class="italic">fundus-&#173;related perimetry</span>), documents the patient’s ret&#173;i&#173;nal point of fixation, scotomas, and the relationship of the fixation point to the scotomas. Most patients with central scotomas spontaneously develop eccentric fixation but may have poor oculomotor control at the eccentric area or preferred ret&#173;i&#173;nal loci (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-3</span>). They may use multiple PRLs, change fixation depending on target size or illumination, or develop a sense of “straight ahead” related to their PRL, rather than their fovea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The vision rehabilitation clinician needs to appreciate the nature of the patient’s fixation (foveal or eccentric), the presence and nature of scotomas (central or paracentral), and the relationship of fixation and scotoma. For example a scotoma may surround fixation, as in foveal-&#173;sparing scotomas (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-4A</span>), be right of fixation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-6A</span>) and obscure next words (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-6B</span>), or be left of fixation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-7</span>) and make it difficult to carry out an accurate saccade to the beginning of the next line of print. Although some believe that a PRL looking up (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-8</span>) is optimal, as it would allow a horizontal span for left-&#173;to-&#173;right readers, no difference in reading speed with PRL location has been determined. Scotomas that surround seeing ret&#173;ina may interfere with the recognition of large objects, fluent reading, or using magnification, depending on the size of the central seeing field (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-4B</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Scotomas can vary widely in size, shape, number, and density, and they may not correspond to the fundus appearance of atrophy, scarring, or pigment alteration. This lack of correspondence is particularly impor&#173;tant to consider in patients with wet AMD who receive anti–&#173;vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (anti-&#173;VEGF) injections. Such patients may not exhibit obvious scars yet still have significant scotomas in their central field.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single">Crossland MD, Jackson ML, Seiple WH. Microperimetry: a review of fundus related perimetry. <span class="italic">Optometry Reports</span>. 2012; 2:11–15.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Peripheral visual field</span> Peripheral visual field defects cause patients to bump into objects or &#173;people, trip over objects and curbs, and lose their orientation particularly in unfamiliar areas. Goldmann fields, automated peripheral fields, or carefully conducted confrontational fields can be informative in the setting of patients with glaucoma, peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal disease, or optic nerve or neurologic disease affecting visual pathways.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Assessments of other visual functions</span> Glare, color vision (discussed in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span> and in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous</span>), binocularity (see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>), eye movements and accommodation (see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>) may be considered in some situations. Glare is the discomfort or impairment of vision caused by scattered light (mainly Mie-&#173;type scattering in the forward direction; see Chapter&#160;2). It occurs commonly in ocular conditions such as corneal disease, cataracts, macular dystrophy, and albinism, and somewhat less commonly in AMD or glaucoma. Patients with reduced contrast sensitivity often require increased illumination, which may, in turn, exacerbate glare. Therefore, determining sensitivity to glare is impor&#173;tant so that you can advise patients about optimal lighting.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The simplest way to assess glare is through the history; however, formal testing can be done with a brightness acuity tester, a handheld device that allows the patient to view a distant target through a small dome that floods the eye with off-&#173;axis illumination.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Per&#173;for&#173;mance of visual tasks</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">To assess patients’ current success with visual tasks, they can be observed &#173;doing tasks such as reading, using their cell phone or computer, writing, or ambulating. Reading tests vary and include tests to assess reading single numbers or words (spot reading), paragraphs (continuous print reading; eg, the International Reading Speed Texts [iReST]) or sentences with decreasing size of text (eg, the Minnesota Low-&#173;Vision Reading Test (MNREAD, <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-9</span>). Useful variables include the minimum size of print that can be read with current glasses or devices (reading acuity), reading errors, and the optimal size text for reading fluency (critical print size). The latter can inform magnification goals. It is impor&#173;tant to note that dif&#173;fer&#173;ent patients with the same distance visual acuity &#173;will read dif&#173;fer&#173;ent sizes of near print if they are using dif&#173;fer&#173;ent powers of reading add. The reading add power used and the distance from the eye to the text should always be documented when mea&#173;sur&#173;ing near vision (eg, 0.4&#160;M at 40&#160;cm, with <span class="symbol">+</span>2.50 add). For purposes of vision rehabilitation, it is often con&#173;ve&#173;nient to describe the print size of reading materials using M notation. Note: the M size of an optotype is the distance (in meters) at which the sample can be read by a person with normal acuity—&#173;thus, “1&#160;M” print is normally legible at 1.0&#160;m.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Observing a patient reading the &#173;actual material that he or she normally reads—&#173;such as the newspaper or medi&#173;cation labels, or &#173;doing a task that they value such as using a cell phone, writing, reading prices at arm’s length or walking independently—&#173;can reveal not only difficulties or successes, but also current adaptive strategies, such as head posture, manipulation of the material, or attempts to use current devices. Computer and cell phone difficulties may include losing the cursor into surrounding areas of field loss, misdialing phone numbers, or having difficulty with keyboards.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Observing a patient ambulate provides valuable insight into the need for orientation and mobility training, white-&#173;cane or support-&#173;cane use, or scanning training.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many dif&#173;fer&#173;ent questionnaires have been used to elicit patient reports of difficulties with visual tasks.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Interventions</p>
			<p class="h3-h2 ParaOverride-10">Devices</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Traditional options for magnification include higher adds, high-&#173;plus reading glasses, magnifiers, and telescopes. (Magnification is discussed in Chapter&#160;1). Other practical solutions to difficulties include modifying a task, such as by moving closer to distant targets; using larger formats, such as large-&#173;print checks; or substituting with audio, such as digital audio books available through libraries or online. &#173;There is increasing interest in devices such as e-&#173;readers, cell phones, computers and electronic magnification as excellent options for patients with low vision. Other technologies include head-&#173;worn devices, devices that read text aloud, detect objects, or assist patients with low vision or blindness by giving audio directions. Implantable devices include the implantable miniature telescope and ret&#173;i&#173;nal prosthesis.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Higher adds</span> The simplest intervention for a patient with moderate low vision is to increase the reading add. Ophthalmologists should be strongly encouraged to consider <span class="symbol">+</span>4.00 adds or &#173;simple over-&#173;the-&#173;counter readers, such as <span class="symbol">+</span>4.00 readers, as long as patients can learn to maintain the closer focal distance and use supplemental lighting if beneficial. This can be attempted prior to referral for comprehensive vision rehabilitation. Patients &#173;will often accept higher adds, such as readers in powers from <span class="symbol">+</span>6.00 to <span class="symbol">+</span>12.00 with appropriate base-in prism and the appropriate focal distance. A <span class="symbol">+</span>10.00 reading add &#173;will require a reading distance at the focal point of the lens, which &#173;will be 1/10&#160;m (ie, 10&#160;cm, or 4&#160;in). In binocular patients, prism is required to assist convergence and relax accommodation. The recommended prism strength is 2 prism diopters (<span class="greek-tx">Δ</span>) more base-in (BI) than the numerical add power, in each eye. For example, if the distance prescription is plano OU and the appropriate add power for reading is <span class="symbol">+</span>8.00 D, then the prescription should read as follows: OD: <span class="symbol">+</span>8.00 sphere with 10<span class="greek-tx">Δ</span> BI; OS: <span class="symbol">+</span>8.00 sphere with 10<span class="greek-tx">Δ</span> BI. Prism is not required in adds up to <span class="symbol">+</span>4.00 D.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Readers with prism are available ready-&#173;made in powers from <span class="symbol">+</span>6.00 D to <span class="symbol">+</span>14.00 D and allow a wide field of view. Monocular aspheric spectacles, available from <span class="symbol">+</span>6.00 D to <span class="symbol">+</span>32.00 D, are used less often. Computer glasses with intermediate-&#173;strength add powers are useful and can be prescribed as a bifocal with the intermediate power in the upper segment. In general, reading glasses allow hands-&#173;free magnification and a large field of vision; however, &#173;there is a shortened working distance, and supplemental lighting is required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Historically an add was calculated as the inverse of the visual acuity (Kestenbaum rule: the inverse of the visual acuity fraction is the add power, in diopters, to read 1&#160;M type—&#173;about 8 points, corresponding to the 20/50 line on a standard near-&#173;vision card calibrated for use at 14 inches), and this calculation may provide a general starting point; however, it is now appreciated that many other &#173;factors influence reading fluency, such as fixation location, scotomas, perceptual span, crowding, and contrast sensitivity. The Kestenbaum rule would estimate that a patient with 20/200 acuity would require 200/20, or 10 D of add. For fluent reading, patients with 20/200 acuity may actually require higher add than calculated.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Magnifiers</span> Handheld and stand magnifiers are available in illuminated or nonilluminated formats. A &#173;simple handheld or illuminated stand magnifier in low-&#173;to-&#173;medium power can allow continuous text reading for patients with mild-&#173;to-&#173;moderate vision loss. Patients with tremors or difficulty holding a magnifier may find success with a stand magnifier that rests directly on the page (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-10</span>). Stand magnifiers are set in a frame that sits on the material and keeps the lens at the appropriate distance. Higher-&#173;powered magnifiers (higher than 20 D) have a limited field of view and allow one to read short text, but are seldom comfortable for extended reading of continuous print &#173;because of the requirement of continuous movement along the line of text. Low-&#173;powered magnifiers (<span class="symbol">+</span>5 to <span class="symbol">+</span>12 D) with light-&#173;emitting-&#173;diode illumination are the most common handheld magnifiers (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-11</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The “power” or “magnification &#173;factor” or “enlargement ratio” of a magnifier is usually specified in terms of the relative angular size of the magnified image compared with the angular size of the original object at a standard reading distance (see Chapter&#160;1). Most commonly, the reference distance is taken as 25&#160;cm. In general, the maximal magnification &#173;will be obtained when the object to be viewed is placed at the anterior focal point of the magnifier. When the magnifier is used this way, the magnification &#173;factor is equal to the dioptric power of the lens divided by 4 (the dioptric equivalent of the reference distance of 25&#160;cm). For example, the power of a <span class="symbol">+</span>24 D magnifier is 6<span class="symbol">×</span> (24 D/4 D); however, magnifiers are used in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent manners and held at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent distances. &#173;Simple low-&#173;power magnifiers (eg, <span class="symbol">+</span>4&#160;D) are rarely used by holding the object at the anterior focal point of the magnifier, &#173;because it is difficult to hold a lens steady so far from the page; therefore, the previous magnification &#173;factor convention is no longer appropriate. Magnifiers are often labeled with a “trade magnification” power. Trade magnification is calculated as the (diopter power of the hand magnifier)/4 <span class="symbol">+</span>1, so the trade magnification of <span class="symbol">+</span>4&#160;D handheld lens is 2<span class="symbol">×</span>.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Telescopes</span> &#173;There are 2 types of telescopes; astronomical (also called <span class="italic">Keplerian</span>) telescopes and Galilean telescopes (optics of telescopes are discussed in Chapter&#160;1). Their features are compared in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;9-1</span>. Telescopes are much less commonly used than magnifiers, as tasks that require magnification for distance viewing are less-&#173;frequent goals than &#173;those for near viewing. Handheld monoculars, binoculars, and spectacle-&#173;mounted telescopes allow the benefit of magnification at a greater distance, with the drawback of reduction in field of view, a narrow depth of field, and reduced contrast. (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-12A</span>). The latter is particularly limiting in patients with significant loss of contrast sensitivity. Autofocus telescope models are available. A &#173;simple telescopic spectacle without a casing has become popu&#173;lar, as it is lightweight and relatively inexpensive (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-12B</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Loupes (telemicroscopes) are spectacle-&#173;mounted close-&#173;focusing telescopes set to focus at near points. They allow a greater working distance than high-&#173;add reading glasses; however, as with all telescopes, the visual field is narrow and the depth of field small. Bioptic telescopes are spectacle-&#173;mounted telescopes set to focus at distance, mounted in the upper portion of the lenses of carrier spectacles. Many states, and the Netherlands in Eu&#173;rope, allow driving with bioptic telescopes. The telescopic portion of the spectacles is positioned superior to the line of sight and used only briefly to read signs or look into the distance. The rest of the time, the individual drives looking through the regular prescription portion of his or her spectacles. Driving with a bioptic telescope requires prescription of the device as well as device training, driver training and, in some states, on-&#173;road evaluation. Patients with good contrast sensitivity and intact central field are optimal candidates for bioptic driving.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Electronic devices</span> Electronic devices allow magnification, contrast enhancement, and text-&#173;to-&#173;speech conversion. Magnification using video magnifiers (video cameras combined with screens; also referred to as <span class="italic">CCTVs</span>), computers, or tablets is now used very extensively by patients with low vision (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-13</span>). Video magnifiers are available in vari&#173;ous formats, including handheld versions, desk versions, or devices worn on the head. They allow variable magnification, comfortable reading positions, and enhanced or reversed contrast, features not available with optical magnifiers. Desk and head-&#173;mounted video magnifiers can use optical character recognition to read text aloud. Computer accessibility options on Win&#173;dows and Macintosh computers provide magnification, modified contrast, and audio screen readers. Large monitors and larger-&#173;format keyboards assist, and tele&#173;vi&#173;sions are often used as large monitors. The major difficulties with electronic devices are cost and training requirements; however, in some jurisdictions, and for certain individuals, devices are provided at no or reduced cost. For example, devices are provided by some state socie&#173;ties and are also provided to veterans.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When the accessibility features of the computer operating system are not adequate, additional magnification, screen reading (eg, AI Squared’s ZoomText; see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-13I</span>), or speech-&#173;to-&#173;text software can be considered. &#173;These require training. Smartphones provide very impressive utility for patients with vision loss as they allow not only magnification, but also text-&#173;to-&#173;speech and audio interaction for voice dialing phone numbers, searching the internet, and sending voice texts or email. Many additional cell phone applications can identify colors, currency, or objects. New and emerging voice-&#173;directed devices accomplish tasks such as setting thermostats or selecting &#173;music. Ser&#173;vices available using cell phone applications can offer audible directions, object identification, or identification of objects in one’s path. Audio books, most often in DAISY digital format (Digital Accessible Information System) are used widely by patients with vision loss and are available &#173;free through the Library of Congress in the US, the Center for Equitable Library Access in Canada, and from online libraries such as Bookshare. &#173;These are extensive libraries. The Bookshare accessible library, for example, has more than 500,000 titles that can be accessed via audio, by listening while seeing highlighted text, by using digital braille, or converting to large print or paper braille format. Many applications and devices exist to play audio books.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Nonoptical aids</span> The armamentarium of tools to assist patients with impaired vision extends beyond electronic and optical devices. &#173;Simple, practical devices include large-&#173;format watches, telephones, remote controls, playing cards, and checks. Talking clocks, scales and timers, bold-&#173;lettered computer keyboards, needle threaders, dark-&#173;lined writing paper, and felt-&#173;tip pens with black ink are a partial list of items that are often useful.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Blind rehabilitation and sight substitution devices</span> Patients with no or very limited vision, particularly &#173;those who lose vision quickly, &#173;will require blind rehabilitation with sight substitutes that may include electronic text-&#173;to-&#173;speech or braille. Refreshable braille displays can be connected to computers and tablet devices. They have small, moving pins that rise or lower to create braille patterns that can be read tactilely. Short-&#173;term residential blind rehabilitation ser&#173;vices, available in some areas, can offer &#173;great benefit for patients faced with the daunting task of adjusting to sudden and profound loss of vision. Prosthetic ret&#173;i&#173;nal implants are being developed, and many groups around the world are working on subret&#173;i&#173;nal, suprachoroidal, or epiret&#173;i&#173;nal devices in addition to cortical visual prostheses that stimulate the brain directly. Currently, devices allow patients to see outlines or contrast.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Training</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;After the low vision evaluation and creation of a vision rehabilitation plan for interventions, patients should be trained to accomplish tasks with modifications and use of appropriate devices. Medicare and some other health insurers in the US fund occupational therapists to train patients, just as rehabilitation is provided for other disabilities such as neurological or orthopedic conditions. Occupational therapists, or other state or privately funded vision rehabilitation therapists or technology specialists, can assess home safety, modify lighting, provide labels for appliances or dials, assist with strategies to manage glare, and instruct in accessibility features with computers, tablets, or cell phones. Physical, cognitive, psychosocial, and environmental &#173;factors that may impact per&#173;for&#173;mance must be considered. Although eccentric fixation can develop spontaneously in patients with central field loss, training may improve the efficiency of using the PRL. Approaches to training include perceptual training, oculomotor training, practice reading magnified text, and training a new direction of fixation (trained ret&#173;i&#173;nal locus). Currently, research has not identified a single recommended method. Prisms for assisting eccentric viewing in maculopathy are controversial and infrequently used. A large sample randomized controlled trial showed &#173;little benefit.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with neurologic disease often have field loss, pro&#173;cessing deficits, or ocular symptoms that can be assisted by vision rehabilitation. Scanning, sector prisms to displace images to the seeing field, and vision restoration with computer training are rehabilitation strategies proposed for patients with hemianopia. A comparative trial of scanning and prisms showed improvement in vision-&#173;related quality of life with scanning training. Scanning training can be provided by Medicare-&#173;funded occupational therapists. Stroke management guidelines include reviews of evidence for interventions for visual neglect.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Often physicians must communicate information to patients with low vision that patients &#173;will perceive as “bad news,” such as that they are not able to drive or that vision &#173;will not improve. Communication techniques have been conceptualized in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent communication models (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-14</span>); however, keys to delivering bad news include allowing sufficient time for the discussion, acknowledging patient emotions and conveying that the physician appreciates that the emotions are connected to the negative news.

Devices are provided in some jurisdictions, such as certain Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean countries, and by some agencies such as the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Orientation and mobility training is offered by some agencies to provide instruction in using visual cues, telescopes, long white canes, and GPS devices for safe and in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent ambulation. Vision loss also affects the patient’s spouse and &#173;family. Referral to psychological counseling and support groups may be part of the rehabilitation team’s approach to helping patients, and their families, cope and adapt. Social workers and other counselors may be called upon to contribute to this rehabilitation pro&#173;cess. A model of a continuum of care encouraging referral from ophthalmologists to vision rehabilitation consultation and to other multidisciplinary ser&#173;vices has been published (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-15</span>). The goal of multidisciplinary vision rehabilitation is collaboration among ser&#173;vices to best address patients’ goals and achieve optimal clinical outcomes.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Pediatric Low Vision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although vision loss is less frequent in the pediatric population, this cohort is an impor&#173;tant group requiring the ophthalmologist’s attention. &#173;Every child with loss of vision needs to be recognized, and the ophthalmologist’s response should include recommending vision rehabilitation. Most adults with low vision have lost vision &#173;because of an ocular disease incurred &#173;later in life. Thus, they have already acquired many of the vision-&#173;aided skills (eg, reading, understanding social cues, cooking, self-&#173;care tasks) that are impor&#173;tant for functioning in society. &#173;Children with low vision, however, need to learn &#173;these skills despite poor or no vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most prevalent &#173;causes of visual impairment in &#173;children in the US are cortical visual impairment, retinopathy of prematurity, optic nerve hypoplasia, albinism, optic atrophy, and congenital infections. Many of &#173;these &#173;children have coexisting physical and/or cognitive disabilities that create further challenges to successful integration into society.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, skill acquisition is developmentally linked to vision, thus requiring dif&#173;fer&#173;ent interventions at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ages. It is impor&#173;tant to be aware of the needs of each age group and tailor the assistance to &#173;those needs. Rehabilitation of infants and &#173;children requires a team approach, often involving occupational and physical therapists, special educators, and physicians working with the child and &#173;family from the earliest stages pos&#173;si&#173;ble. Ophthalmologists may be one of the most consistent contacts over many years for the parents of a visually impaired child, and, as such, they need to be aware of and support the rehabilitation pro&#173;cess.

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-15">Ongoing Eye Care</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients having vision rehabilitation should continue to see their ophthalmologist and to be monitored, including screening for glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, or refractive changes. Treatment for disorders such as cataract and AMD should still be considered for patients with limited visual potential, even though normal or near-&#173;normal visual acuity may not be a potential outcome. The difference between 20/200 and 20/400 vision may substantially reduce the magnification required for reading and enhance the effectiveness of visual rehabilitation techniques.</p>
