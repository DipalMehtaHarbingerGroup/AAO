			<p class="h1">Introduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top2"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The pro&#173;cess of clinical refraction represents one of the practical applications of geometric optics. Refraction is a critical component in an ophthalmic examination. It allows the determination of the best corrected vision of the eye. This determination is often necessary in determining the diagnosis and recommended treatment course. The refraction is necessary in determining visual correction with spectacles, contact lenses, lens implants, and refractive corneal surgery. Other techniques, such as the pinhole, corneal topography and tomography, and vari&#173;ous forms of autorefraction are valuable but, as yet, have not replaced manifest refraction in the ophthalmic examination.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Minus Cylinder and Plus Cylinder Terminology</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top3"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The terms <span class="italic">minus cylinder</span> and <span class="italic">plus cylinder</span> are used in vari&#173;ous ways in discussing refraction and prescription of eyeglasses. &#173;These include the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of refraction using the phoropter (refractor), the writing of the prescription for glasses, and the fabrication of spectacles with astigmatism correction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The phoropter is made with both plus and minus spherical lenses. For simplicity, the cylinder component is made up by lenses of only one type—&#173;either plus cylinder lenses or minus cylinder lenses. (Trial lens sets may be ordered as minus cylinder–&#173;plus cylinder, or both.) &#173;There is no consensus as to which type is preferable. In some communities, optometrists tend to prefer phoropters with minus power and ophthalmologists tend to prefer plus power. Minus cylinder phoropters may have potential advantages in the fitting of contact lenses. Minus cylinder phoropters are also useful in determining astigmatism using the asigmatic (clock) dial technique. In contrast, the axis of the plus cylinder may indicate the position of a tight suture in an eye with a penetrating keratoplasty. Plus cylinder equipment is also more natu&#173;ral for purposes of retinoscopy and is often selected by pediatric ophthalmologists for that reason.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The prescription for a spectacle correction may be written in &#173;either minus cylinder or plus cylinder format. Normally this is determined by the type of phoropter used to perform the refraction, so as to minimize the possibility of a transcription error; however, this is not necessary. &#173;Either form may be easily converted to the other (<span class="xref-clin">Clinical Example 4-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the fabrication of spherocylindrical spectacle lenses, the cylindrical component may be placed on the anterior surface (plus or front cylinder) or the posterior surface (minus or back cylinder) of the lens. Current preferred practice is for lenses to be fabricated in minus (back) cylinder format regardless of what type of phoropter is used or how the prescription is written. This decreases the meridional magnification.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Exam Room Length</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top4"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The room in which the refraction is carried out is impor&#173;tant in achieving satisfactory results. For optical purposes, a 20-&#173;foot (6-&#173;M) distance from the patient to the vision chart approximates infinity (<span class="symbol">−</span>0.17 diopters [D]). Many exam rooms are much shorter than this. If the vision chart is placed so that the distance to the patient is only 10 ft (3.05&#160;m) the refraction &#173;will be overplussed by 0.33 D. Mirrors are used to extend the viewing distance to the standard 20 ft (6.09&#160;m) in such rooms. Some patients (including many &#173;children) are not able to effectively fixate into a mirror and need to be examined in longer rooms or hallways. They may also tend to accommodate in a short room, even if it has a mirror to optically extend it. Simply correcting for the shorter working distance by decreasing the plus or increasing the minus in the mea&#173;sured refraction is not recommended &#173;because proper accommodative fogging techniques cannot be performed in such a situation.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Objective Refraction Technique: Retinoscopy</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top5"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although autorefractors are easily accessible, retinoscopy remains an impor&#173;tant skill and tool for the ophthalmologist to objectively determine the spherocylindrical refractive error of the eye. A <span class="italic">retinoscope</span> can also help the examiner detect optical aberrations, irregularities, and opacities, even through small pupils. Retinoscopy is especially useful for examinations of infants, &#173;children, and adults unable to communicate.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most retinoscopes in current use employ the streak projection system developed by Copeland. The illumination of the retinoscope is provided by a bulb with a straight filament that forms a streak in its projection, or by means of a slit-&#173;shaped aperture. The light is reflected from a mirror that is &#173;either half silvered (Welch Allyn, Heine models) or totally silvered around a small circular aperture (Copeland instrument) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-1</span>). The filament light source (or the slit aperture) can be moved in relation to a convex lens in the system using the sleeve of the retinoscope. If the light is slightly divergent, it appears to come from a point &#173;behind the retinoscope, as if the light &#173;were reflected off a flat mirror (ie, a <span class="italic">plane mirror setting</span>) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Alternatively, when the distance between the convex lens and the filament is increased by moving the sleeve on the &#173;handle, convergent light is emitted. In this situation, the image of the filament appears between the examiner and the patient, as if the light &#173;were reflected off a concave mirror (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retinoscopy may be performed with &#173;either a concave mirror setting or a plane mirror setting, determined by the sleeve of the scope. Retinoscopy is usually performed using the plane mirror setting so that light is parallel (or slightly divergent) as it enters the pupil of the patient’s eye. We restrict our discussion to the plane mirror effect; in the concave mirror effect, the direction of motion is opposite that of the plane mirror effect. One use of the concave setting is to sharpen the reflex while determining the axis of astigmatism. Using the concave setting during power determination (of sphere or cylinder) may lead to false end points (neutrality). Not all retinoscopes employ the same sleeve position for the plane mirror setting. For example, the original Copeland retinoscope is in plane position with the sleeve up; the Welch Allyn (or Heine) instrument is in plane position with the sleeve down. The axis of the streak is rotated with the sleeve.</p>
			<p class="h2">Positioning and Alignment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ordinarily, the examiner uses his or her right eye to perform retinoscopy on the patient’s right eye, and the left eye for the patient’s left eye. &#173;Doing so prevents the examiner’s head from moving into the patient’s line of sight and thus inadvertently stimulating accommodation. If the examiner looks directly through the optical centers of the trial lenses while performing retinoscopy, reflections from the lenses may interfere. In general, if the examiner is too far off-&#173;axis, unwanted spherical and cylindrical errors may occur. The optimal alignment is just off center, where the lens reflections can still be seen between the center of the pupil and the lateral edge of the lens. <span class="xref-vid">Video 4-1</span> demonstrates the basics of retinoscopy.</p>

			<p class="h2">Fixation and Fogging</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retinoscopy should be performed with the patient’s accommodation relaxed. The patient should fixate at a distance on a nonaccommodative target. For example, the target may be a dim light at the end of the room or a large Snellen letter (20/200 or 20/400 size). Plus lenses may be introduced in front of the eye not being examined to aid in the relaxation of accommodation. Accommodating &#173;after fogging is performed &#173;will only further blur the image. &#173;Children typically require pharmacologic cycloplegia (such as cyclopentolate 1%).</p>
			<p class="h2">The Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Reflex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The projected streak illuminates an area of the patient’s ret&#173;ina, and this light returns to the examiner. By observing characteristics of this reflex, the examiner determines the refractive status of the eye. If the patient’s eye is <span class="italic">emmetropic,</span> the light rays emerging from the patient’s pupil are parallel to one another; if the eye is <span class="italic">myopic,</span> the rays are convergent (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-4</span>); and if the eye is <span class="italic">hyperopic,</span> the rays are divergent. Through the peephole in the retinoscope, the emerging light is seen as a red reflex in the patient’s pupil. If the examiner (specifically, the peephole of the retinoscope) is at the patient’s far point, all the light leaving the patient’s pupil enters the peephole and illumination is uniform. However, if the far point of the patient’s eye is not at the peephole of the retinoscope, only some of the rays emanating from the patient’s pupil enter the peephole, and illumination of the pupil appears incomplete.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the far point is between the examiner and the myopic patient, the emerging rays &#173;will have focused and then diverged. The border between the dark and lighted portions of the pupil &#173;will move in a direction opposite to the motion (sweep) of the retinoscope streak (known as <span class="italic">against</span> movement) as it is moved across the patient’s pupil. If the far point is &#173;behind the examiner, the light moves in the same direction as the sweep (known as <span class="italic">with</span> movement; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The state in which the light fills the pupil and apparently does not move is known as <span class="italic">neutrality</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-6</span>). At neutrality, if the examiner moves forward (in front of the far point), <span class="italic">with</span> movement is seen; if the examiner moves back and away from the far point, <span class="italic">against</span> movement is seen. The far point may be moved with placement of a correcting lens in front of the patient’s eye.</p>
			<p class="h3">Characteristics of the reflex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The moving retinoscopic reflex has 4 main characteristics (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-7</span>):</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;<span class="italic">Speed.</span> The reflex seen in the pupil moves slowest when the far point is distant from the examiner (peephole of the retinoscope). As the far point is moved &#173;toward the peephole, the speed of the reflex increases. In other words, large refractive errors have a slow-&#173;moving reflex, whereas small errors have a fast reflex.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;<span class="italic">Brilliance.</span> The reflex is dull when the far point is distant from the examiner; it becomes brighter as neutrality is approached.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;<span class="italic">Width.</span> When the far point is distant from the examiner, the streak is narrow. As the far point is moved closer to the examiner, the streak broadens and, at neutrality, fills the entire pupil. This situation applies only to <span class="italic">with</span> movement reflexes.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">4.&#9;<span class="italic">Regularity. </span>An irregular reflex indicates a media prob&#173;lem that should be further explored in examination.</p>
			<p class="h2">The Correcting Lens</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When the examiner uses the appropriate correcting lenses (with &#173;either loose lenses or a <span class="italic">phoropter</span>), the retinoscopic reflex is neutralized. In other words, when the examiner brings the patient’s far point to the peephole, the reflex fills the patient’s entire pupil (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-8</span>). The power of the correcting lens (or lenses) neutralizing the reflex is determined by the refractive error of the eye and the distance of the examiner from the eye (the working distance). Theoretically, the working distance should be at optical infinity but this does not practically allow for changing lenses in front of the eye or seeing the ret&#173;i&#173;nal reflex. The dioptric equivalent of the <span class="italic">working distance</span> (ie, the inverse of the distance) must be subtracted from the power of the correcting lens to determine the &#173;actual refractive error of the patient’s eye. Common working distances are 67&#160;cm (1.50 D) and 50&#160;cm (2.00&#160;D), and many phoropters have a 1.50 D or 2.00 D “working-&#173;distance lens” for use during retinoscopy, which are then removed at the end of the retinoscopy (however, this lens can produce bothersome reflexes). If the examiner is not using the “built-in” working lens in the phoropter, he or she must algebraically subtract the appropriate amount of spherical power to move the neutralization point from the examiner to infinity (<span class="xref-clin">Clinical Example 4-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">For example, an examiner obtains neutralization with a total of <span class="symbol">+</span>4.00 D over the eye (gross retinoscopy) at a working distance of 67&#160;cm. Subtracting 1.50 D for the working distance yields a refractive correction of <span class="symbol">+</span>2.50 D.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any working distance may be used. If the examiner prefers to move closer to the patient for a brighter reflex, the working-&#173;distance correction is adjusted accordingly. Working without an explicit lens to correct for the working distance may allow the use of fewer lenses held in front of the eye, reducing distracting reflections from the lens surfaces.</p>

			<p class="h2">Finding Neutrality</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In <span class="italic">against</span> movement, the far point is between the examiner and the patient. Therefore, to bring the far point to the peephole of the retinoscope, a minus lens is placed in front of the patient’s eye. Similarly, in the case of <span class="italic">with</span> movement, a plus lens is placed in front of the patient’s eye. This procedure gives rise to the &#173;simple clinical rule: If <span class="italic">with</span> movement is observed, add plus power (or subtract minus power); if <span class="italic">against</span> movement is observed, add minus power (or subtract plus power) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-9</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because it is easier to work with the brighter, sharper <span class="italic">with</span> movement image, one should “overminus” the eye and obtain a <span class="italic">with</span> reflex; then reduce the minus power (or add plus power) &#173;until neutrality is reached. Be aware that the slow, dull reflexes of high-&#173;refractive errors may be confused with the neutrality reflex. Media opacities may also produce dull reflexes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once neutrality is found, the lens to correct for the working distance must be removed, &#173;whether it is the built-in retinoscopy lens in the phoropter or by subtracting the appropriate correcting lens based on the working distance used.</p>
			<p class="h2">Retinoscopy of Regular Astigmatism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most eyes have some regular astigmatism. In such cases, light is refracted differently by the 2 principal astigmatic meridians. Let us consider how the retinoscope works in greater detail and apply it to astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sweeping the retinoscope back and forth mea&#173;sures the power along only a single axis. Moving the retinoscope from side to side (with the streak oriented at 90°) mea&#173;sures the optical power in the 180° meridian. Power in this meridian is provided by a cylinder at the 90° axis. The con&#173;ve&#173;nient result is that the streak of the retinoscope is aligned with the axis of the correcting cylinder being tested. In a patient with regular astigmatism, one seeks to neutralize 2 reflexes, 1 from each of the principal meridians.</p>
			<p class="h3">Finding the cylinder axis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before the powers in each of the principal meridians can be determined, the axes of the meridians must be determined. Four characteristics of the streak reflex aid in this determination:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;<span class="italic">Break.</span> A break is observed when the streak is not oriented parallel to 1 of the principal meridians. The reflex streak in the pupil is not aligned with the streak projected on the iris and surface of the eye, and the line appears broken (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-10</span>). The break dis&#173;appears (ie, the line appears continuous) when the projected streak is rotated to the correct axis.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;<span class="italic">Width.</span> The width of the reflex in the pupil varies as it is rotated around the correct axis. The reflex appears narrowest when the streak, or <span class="italic">intercept,</span> aligns with the axis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-11</span>).</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;<span class="italic">Intensity.</span> The intensity of the line is brighter when the streak is on the correct axis.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">4.&#9;<span class="italic">Skew.</span> Skew (oblique motion of the streak reflex) may be used to refine the axis in small cylinders. If the retinoscope streak is off-&#173;axis, it moves in a slightly dif&#173;fer&#173;ent direction from that of the pupillary reflex (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-12</span>). The reflex and streak move in the same direction when the streak is aligned with 1 of the principal meridians.</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When the streak is aligned at the correct axis, the sleeve may be lowered (Copeland instrument) or raised (Welch Allyn instrument) to narrow the streak, allowing the axis to be determined more easily (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-13</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">This axis can be confirmed through a technique known as <span class="italic">straddling,</span> which is &#173;performed with the estimated correcting cylinder in place (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-14</span>). The retinoscope streak is turned 45° off-&#173;axis in both directions, and if the axis is correct, the width of the reflex should be equal in both off-&#173;axis positions. If the axis is not correct, the widths are unequal in &#173;these 2 positions. The axis of the correcting plus &#173;cylinder should be moved &#173;toward the narrower reflex and the straddling repeated &#173;until the widths are equal.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Finding the cylinder power</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;After the 2 principal meridians are identified, the previously explained spherical techniques are applied to each axis:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-6"><span class="italic">With 2 spheres.</span> Neutralize 1 axis with a spherical lens; then neutralize the axis 90° away. The difference between &#173;these readings is the cylinder power. For example, if the 90° axis is neutralized with a <span class="symbol">+</span>1.50 sphere and the 180° axis is neutralized with a <span class="symbol">+</span>2.25 sphere, the gross retinoscopy is <span class="symbol">+</span>1.50 <span class="symbol">+</span>0.75 <span class="symbol">×</span> 180. The examiner’s working distance (ie, <span class="symbol">+</span>1.50) is subtracted from the <span class="italic">sphere</span> to obtain the final refractive correction: plano <span class="symbol">+</span>0.75 <span class="symbol">×</span> 180.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-7"><span class="italic">With a sphere and cylinder.</span> Neutralize 1 axis with a spherical lens. To enable the use of <span class="italic">with</span> reflexes, neutralize the <span class="italic">less plus</span> axis first. Then, with this spherical lens in place, neutralize the axis 90° away by adding a plus cylindrical lens. The sphero&#173;cylindrical gross retinoscopy is read directly from the trial lens apparatus.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is also pos&#173;si&#173;ble to use 2 cylinders at right &#173;angles to each other for this gross retinoscopy. <span class="xref-vid">Video 4-2</span> demonstrates the plus cylinder technique, and <span class="xref-vid">Video 4-3</span> demonstrates the minus cylinder technique.</p>

			<p class="h2">Aberrations of the Retinoscopic Reflex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With irregular astigmatism, almost any type of aberration may appear in the reflex. <span class="italic">Spherical aberrations</span> tend to increase the brightness at the center or periphery of the pupil, depending on &#173;whether they are positive or negative.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As neutrality is approached, 1 part of the reflex may be myopic, whereas the other may be hyperopic relative to the position of the retinoscope. This situation produces a <span class="italic">scissors reflex.</span> &#173;Causes of the scissors reflex include keratoconus, irregular corneal astigmatism, corneal or lenticular opacities, and spherical aberration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All of &#173;these aberrant reflexes, in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar spherical aberration, are more noticeable in patients with large scotopic pupils. When a large pupil is observed during retinoscopy, the examiner should focus on neutralizing the central portion of the light reflex.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;4-1</span> provides a summary of the technique of retinoscopy using a plus &#173;cylinder phoropter.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Pseudoneutralization</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As noted above, in general, with reflexes are brighter, sharper, and easier to perceive and interpret than against reflexes. In par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, the reflex in severely myopic eyes is seldom recognizable as an against reflex—&#173;rather, one sees only a dull, motionless illumination of the entire pupil. This is referred to as <span class="italic">pseudoneutralization</span>. This is best handled by reversing the sleeve of the retinoscope (to the maximal sleeve-up position for Welch-&#173;Allyn type retinoscopes; maximal sleeve-&#173;down position for Copeland retinoscopes). This &#173;will convert the dull pseudoneutral reflex to a readily recognizable with reflex, but in this case, the with reflex must be neutralized by adding minus sphere power. As true neutrality is approached, return the retinoscope sleeve to the usual position. The reflex &#173;will revert to an against reflex as in typical myopic eyes. Continue to add minus sphere power &#173;until a with reflex is obtained, and then reduce the minus sphere so as to reach true neutrality from the with direction. <span class="xref-vid">Video 4-4</span> demonstrates pseudoneutralization.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Subjective Refraction Techniques</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top6"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In subjective refraction techniques, the examiner relies on the patient’s responses to determine the refractive correction. If all refractive errors &#173;were spherical, subjective refraction would be easy. However, determining the astigmatic portion of the correction is more complex, and vari&#173;ous subjective refraction techniques may be used. The Jackson cross cylinder is the most common instrument used in determining the astigmatic correction. However, we begin by discussing the astigmatic dial technique &#173;because it is easier to understand.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Astigmatic Dial Technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An astigmatic dial is a test chart with radially arranged lines that may be used to determine the axes of astigmatism. A pencil of light from a point source is refracted by an astigmatic eye as a conoid of Sturm. The spokes of the astigmatic dial that are parallel to the principal meridians of the eye’s astigmatism are imaged as sharp lines, which correspond to the focal lines of the conoid of Sturm.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;4-15A</span> shows an eye with compound hyperopic astigmatism and how it sees an astigmatic dial. In this example, the vertical line of the astigmatic dial is the blackest and sharpest &#173;because the vertical focal line of each conoid of Sturm is closer to the ret&#173;ina than the horizontal focal line is. By accommodating, however, the patient might pull both focal lines forward. To avoid accommodation, fogging is used. Sufficient plus sphere is placed before the eye to pull both focal lines into the vitreous, creating compound myopic astigmatism (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-15B</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The focal line closest to the ret&#173;ina can then be identified with certainty &#173;because it is now the blackest and sharpest line of the astigmatic dial. (In the example in Fig&#160;4-15B, this is the horizontal line on the dial.) Note that the terms <span class="italic">blackest</span> and <span class="italic">sharpest</span> are more easily understood by patients and should be used in place of the word <span class="italic">clearest.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;After the examiner locates the principal meridians of the astigmatism, the conoid of Sturm can be collapsed by moving the anterior focal line back &#173;toward the posterior focal line. This task can be accomplished by adding a minus cylinder with an axis parallel to the anterior focal line (perpendicular to the blackest and sharpest line). It is helpful to remember the “rule of 30”: place the correcting minus cylinder axis along the meridian equal to 30 times the “clock-&#173;hour” of the sharpest, blackest line on the dial (reading between 0&#160;and 6). In <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;4-15C</span>, the vertical focal line has been moved back to the position of the horizontal focal line and collapsed to a point by the addition of a minus cylinder with an axis at 90°. Note that 90 <span class="symbol">=</span> 30 <span class="symbol">×</span> 3, the clock-&#173;hour of the (horizontal) darkest line. Notice that the minus cylinder is placed with its axis <span class="italic">perpendicular</span> to the blackest meridian on the astigmatic dial. Also note that as the conoid of Sturm is collapsed, the focal lines dis&#173;appear into a point focus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All of the lines of the astigmatic dial now appear equally black but still are not in perfect focus, &#173;because the eye remains slightly fogged to control accommodation. At this point, a visual acuity chart is used; plus sphere is removed &#173;until the best visual acuity is obtained (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-15D</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In summary, the following steps are used in astigmatic dial refraction:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;Obtain the best visual acuity using spheres only.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;Fog the eye to approximately 20/50 by adding plus sphere.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;Ask the patient to identify the blackest and sharpest line of the astigmatic dial.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">4.&#9;Add minus cylinder with the axis <span class="italic">perpendicular</span> to the blackest and sharpest line &#173;until all lines appear equal.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">5.&#9;Reduce plus sphere (or add minus) &#173;until the best visual acuity is obtained with the visual acuity chart.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Astigmatic dial refraction can also be performed with plus cylinder equipment, but this technique must be used in a way that simulates minus cylinder effect. All of the above steps remain the same except for step 4, which becomes “Add <span class="italic">plus</span> cylinder with the axis <span class="italic">parallel</span> to the blackest and sharpest line.” As each 0.25 D of plus cylinder power is added, change the sphere si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously by 0.25 D in the minus direction. &#173;Doing so simulates minus cylinder effect exactly by moving the anterior focal line posteriorly without changing the position of the posterior focal line.</p>

			<p class="h2">Stenopeic Slit Technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The stenopeic slit is an opaque trial lens with an oblong slit whose width forms a pinhole with re&#173;spect to vergence perpendicular to the slit (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-16</span>). If an examiner is unable to decipher the astigmatism by performing the usual retinoscopy &#173;because of the subject eye’s irregular astigmatism or unclear media, he or she may neutralize the refractive error with spherical lenses and the slit at vari&#173;ous meridians to find a spherocylindrical correction. This correction can then be refined subjectively. This pro&#173;cess is especially useful for patients with small pupils, lenticular or corneal opacities, and/or irregular astigmatism. If the subject can accommodate, fog and unfog using plus sphere to find the most plus power accepted. Then turn the slit &#173;until the subject says the image is sharpest. If, for example, <span class="symbol">−</span>3.00 D sphere is best &#173;there, when the slit is oriented vertically, this finding indicates <span class="symbol">−</span>3.00 D at 90° in a power cross. If the best sphere with the slit oriented horizontally is <span class="symbol">−</span>5.00 D, then the result is <span class="symbol">−</span>3.00 <span class="symbol">−</span>2.00 <span class="symbol">×</span> 90. It is helpful to think of the “axis” of the stenopeic slit as a thin line <span class="italic">perpendicular</span> to the orientation of the slit.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cross &#173;Cylinder Technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cross &#173;cylinder technique to mea&#173;sure astigmatism was described by Edward Jackson in 1887. In Jackson’s words, the cross &#173;cylinder lens is prob&#173;ably “far more useful, and far more used” than any other lens in clinical refraction. &#173;Every ophthalmologist should be familiar with the princi&#173;ples involved in its use. Although the cross cylinder is usually used to <span class="italic">refine</span> the cylinder axis and power of a refraction that has already been obtained, it can also be used for the entire astigmatic refraction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A cross cylinder is a lens with a spheroequivalent power of zero but with mixed astigmatism of equal amounts. Common cross cylinders are: <span class="symbol">−</span>0.50 <span class="symbol">+</span>1.00 <span class="symbol">×</span> 090 or <span class="symbol">−</span>0.25 <span class="symbol">+</span>0.50 <span class="symbol">×</span> 090. They are mounted so that they can be rotated about their axis (90° or 180°) or at a point halfway between the axis (45° or 135°).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The first step in cross cylinder refraction is to adjust the sphere to yield the best visual acuity with accommodation relaxed. Begin by selecting a starting point: this may be the current prescription, the retinoscopy, or autorefraction findings. Dial this into a trial frame or phoropter. Fog the eye to be examined with plus sphere while the patient views a visual acuity chart; then decrease the fog &#173;until the best visual acuity is obtained. If astigmatism is pres&#173;ent, decreasing the fog places the circle of least confusion on the ret&#173;ina, creating a mixed astigmatism. Then use test figures that are 1 or 2 lines larger than the patient’s best visual acuity. At this point, introduce the cross cylinder, first for refinement of cylinder axis and then for refinement of cylinder power.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the starting point refraction contains no cylindrical component, the cross cylinder may be used to check for the presence of astigmatism in the following manner. The cross cylinder is first placed at 90° and 180°. If a preferred flip position is found, cylinder is added with the axis parallel to the respective plus or minus axis of the cross cylinder &#173;until the 2&#160;flip choices are equal. If no preference is found with the cross cylinder axes at 90° and 180°, then check the axes at 45° and 135° before assuming that no astigmatism is pres&#173;ent. Once any cylinder power is found, axis and power should be refined in the usual manner.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another method of determining the presence of astigmatism is to dial 0.50 D of cylinder into the phoropter (while preserving the spherical equivalent with a compensatory 0.25 D change in the sphere). Ask the patient to slowly rotate the cylinder axis once around using the knob on the phoropter. If the patient finds a preferred position, it becomes the starting point for the cross &#173;cylinder refinement. If &#173;doing so has no effect, &#173;there may be no clinically significant astigmatism. Keratometry or corneal topography may be helpful if the examiner suspects that astigmatism may still be pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Always refine cylinder axis before refining cylinder power. This sequence is necessary &#173;because the correct axis may be found in the presence of an incorrect power, but the full cylinder power is found only in the presence of the correct axis. The axis may be rechecked &#173;after the power is determined and is more impor&#173;tant in higher levels of astigmatism power.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Refinement of cylinder axis involves the combination of cylinders at oblique axes. When the axis of the correcting cylinder is not aligned with that of the astigmatic eye’s cylinder, the combined cylinders produce residual astigmatism with a meridian roughly 45° away from the principal meridians of the 2 cylinders. To refine the axis, position the principal meridians of the cross cylinder 45° away from &#173;those of the correcting cylinder (if using a handheld Jackson cross cylinder, the stem of the lens &#173;handle &#173;will be parallel to the axis of the correcting cylinder). Pres&#173;ent the patient with alternative flip choices, and select the choice that is the blackest and sharpest to the patient. Then rotate the axis of the correcting cylinder &#173;toward the corresponding plus or minus axis of the cross cylinder (plus cylinder axis is rotated &#173;toward the plus cylinder axis of the cross cylinder, and minus cylinder axis is rotated &#173;toward the minus cylinder axis of the cross cylinder). Low-&#173;power cylinders are rotated in increments of 15°; high-&#173;power cylinders are rotated by smaller amounts, usually 5°, but can be as small as 1° for very high astigmatism. Repeat this procedure &#173;until the flip choices appear equal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To refine cylinder power, align the cross &#173;cylinder axes with the principal meridians of the correcting lens (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-17</span>). The examiner should change cylinder power according to the patient’s responses; the spherical equivalent of the refractive correction should remain constant to keep the circle of least confusion on the ret&#173;ina. Ensure that the correction remains constant by changing the sphere half as much and in the opposite direction as the cylinder power is changed. In other words, for &#173;every 0.50 D of cylinder power change, change the sphere by 0.25 D in the opposite direction. Periodically, the sphere power should be adjusted for the best visual acuity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Continue to refine cylinder power &#173;until the patient reports that both flip choices appear equal. At that point, the 2 flip choices produce equal and opposite mixed astigmatism, blurring the visual acuity chart equally.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the examiner is planning on prescribing for astigmatism at an axis <span class="italic">dif&#173;fer&#173;ent</span> from that mea&#173;sured with the cross cylinder (ie, 90° or 180° instead of an oblique axis) the cross cylinder can be used to mea&#173;sure the cylinder power at the new axis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Remember to use the proper-&#173;power cross cylinder for the patient’s visual acuity level. For example, a <span class="symbol">±</span>0.25 D cross cylinder is commonly used with visual acuity levels of 20/30 and better. A high-&#173;power cross cylinder (<span class="symbol">±</span>0.50 D or <span class="symbol">±</span>1.00 D) allows a patient with poorer vision to recognize differences in the flip choices.</p>

			<p class="h2">Refining the Sphere</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;After cylinder power and axis have been determined using &#173;either the astigmatic dial technique or the cross &#173;cylinder method, the final step of determining monocular refraction is to refine the sphere. The endpoint in the refraction is the strongest plus sphere, or weakest minus sphere, that yields the best visual acuity. The following discussion briefly considers some of the methods used.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When the cross &#173;cylinder technique has been used to determine the cylinder power and axis, the refractive error is presumed to a single point. Add plus sphere in <span class="symbol">+</span>0.25 D increments &#173;until the patient reports decreased vision. If no additional plus sphere is accepted, add minus sphere in <span class="symbol">−</span>0.25 D increments &#173;until the patient achieves the most optimal visual acuity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Using accommodation, the patient can compensate for excess minus sphere. Therefore, it is impor&#173;tant to use the least minus sphere necessary to reach the best visual acuity. In effect, accommodation creates a reverse Galilean telescope, whereby the eye generates more plus power as minus power is added to the trial lenses before the eye. As this minus power increases, the patient observes that the letters appear smaller and more distant (but also “darker,” which the patient may misinterpret as “clearer”).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The patient should be told what to look for. Before subtracting each 0.25 D increment, tell the patient that the letters may appear sharper and brighter or smaller and darker, and ask the patient to report any such change. Reduce the amount of plus sphere only if the patient can actually read more letters.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the astigmatic dial technique has been used and the astigmatism is neutralized (ie, if all the lines on the astigmatic dial are equally sharp or equally blurred), the eye should still be fogged; additional plus sphere only increases the blur. Therefore, use minus sphere to reduce the sphere power &#173;until the best visual acuity is achieved. Again, the examiner should be careful not to add too much minus sphere.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To verify the spherical endpoint, the <span class="italic">duochrome test</span> (also known as the <span class="italic">red-&#173;green</span> or <span class="italic">bichrome test</span>) is used (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-18</span>). A split red-&#173;green filter makes the background of the visual acuity chart appear vertically divided into a red half and a green half. &#173;Because of the chromatic aberration of the eye, the shorter (green) wavelengths are focused in front of the longer (red) wavelengths. The eye typically focuses near the midpoint of the spectrum, between the red and green wavelengths. With optimal spherical correction, the letters on the red and green halves of the chart appear equally sharp. The commercial filters used in the duochrome test produce a chromatic interval of approximately 0.50&#160;D between the red and green wavelengths. When the image is clearly focused in white light, the eye is 0.25 D myopic for the green letters and 0.25 D hyperopic for the red letters.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Each eye is tested separately for the duochrome test, which is begun with the eye slightly fogged (by 0.50 D) to relax accommodation. The letters on the red side should appear sharper; the clinician should add minus sphere &#173;until the 2 sides appear the same. If the patient responds that the letters on the green side are sharper, the patient is overminused, and more plus power should be added. When in doubt, it is preferable to err on the side of the more-&#173;plus or less-&#173;minus alternative (“leave ’em in the red”). Some clinicians use the RAM–&#173;GAP mnemonic—&#173;“<span class="italic">r</span>ed <span class="italic">a</span>dd <span class="italic">m</span>inus; <span class="italic">g</span>reen <span class="italic">a</span>dd <span class="italic">p</span>lus”—to recall how to use the duochrome test.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because this test is based on chromatic aberration and not on color discrimination, it is used even with color-&#173;blind patients (although it may be necessary to identify the sides of the chart as left and right rather than red and green). An eye with overactive accommodation may still require too much minus sphere in order to balance the red and green. Cycloplegia may be necessary. The duochrome test is not used with patients whose visual acuity is worse than 20/30 (6/9), &#173;because the 0.50 D difference between the 2 sides is too small to distinguish.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-15">Binocular Balance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The final step of subjective refraction is to make certain that accommodation has been relaxed equally in both eyes. Several methods of binocular balance are commonly used. Most require that the corrected visual acuity be nearly equal in both eyes.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-16">Alternate occlusion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When the endpoint refraction is fogged using a <span class="symbol">+</span>0.75 D sphere before each eye, the visual acuity should be reduced to 20/40–20/50 (6/12–6/15). Alternately cover the eyes and ask the patient if the chart is equally blurred. If the eyes are not in balance, plus sphere should be added to the better seeing eye &#173;until balance is achieved.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to testing for binocular balance, the fogging method also provides information about appropriate sphere power. If &#173;either eye is overminused or underplussed, the patient should read smaller (better than 20/40) letters than expected. In this case, the refraction endpoints should be reconsidered.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Prism dissociation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most sensitive test of binocular balance is prism dissociation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-19</span>). For this test, the refractive endpoints are fogged with<span class="symbol">+</span>0.75 to <span class="symbol">+</span>1.00 D spheres, and vertical prisms of 4 or 6 prism diopters (<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">Δ</span>) are placed before 1 eye (or divided equally between the 2&#160;eyes) using the Risley prisms in the phoropter (or in a trial lens frame). Some phoropters have a built-in 6<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">Δ</span> setting for this test. Use of the prisms &#173;causes the patient to see 2 charts, 1&#160;above the other. A single line, usually 20/40 (6/12), is isolated on the chart; the patient sees 2&#160;separate lines si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously, 1 for each eye. The patient can readily identify differences between the fogged images in the 2 eyes of as &#173;little as 0.25 D sphere. In practice, <span class="symbol">+</span>0.25 D sphere is placed before 1 eye and then before the other. In each instance, if the eyes are balanced, the patient reports that the image corresponding to the eye with the additional <span class="symbol">+</span>0.25 D sphere is blurrier. &#173;After a balance is established between the 2&#160;eyes, remove the prism and reduce the fog binocularly &#173;until the best visual acuity is obtained.</p>

			<p class="h1">Cycloplegic and Noncycloplegic Refraction</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top7"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ideally, refractive error is mea&#173;sured with accommodation relaxed. The amount of habitual accommodative tone varies from person to person, and even within an individual it varies at times and decreases with age. &#173;Because determining this variable may not always be pos&#173;si&#173;ble, cycloplegic drugs are sometimes used. The indication and appropriate dosage for a specific cycloplegic drug depend on the patient’s age, accommodative amplitude, and refractive error.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A practical approach to obtaining satisfactory refraction is to perform a careful noncycloplegic (or manifest) refraction, ensuring relaxed accommodation with fogging or other nonpharmacologic techniques. If the results are inconsistent or variable, a cycloplegic refraction should be performed. If the findings of &#173;these 2 refractions are similar, the prescription may be based on the manifest refraction. If &#173;there is a disparity, a postcycloplegic evaluation (performed at a time &#173;after the cycloplegic effects have abated, usually several days &#173;later) may be necessary. Most &#173;children require cycloplegic refraction &#173;because of their high amplitude of accommodation. For more details on the cycloplegic drugs used in adults and &#173;children, please refer to BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology.</span></p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Overrefraction</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top8"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phoropters may be used to refract the eyes of patients with highly ametropic vision. Variability in the vertex distance of the refraction (the distance from the back surface of the spectacle lens to the cornea) and other induced errors make prescribing directly from the phoropter findings unreliable.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some of &#173;these prob&#173;lems can be avoided if highly ametropic eyes are refracted over the patients’ current glasses (overrefraction). If the new lenses are prescribed with the same base curve and thickness (contributors to image size and aniseikonia) as the current lenses and are fitted in the same frames, many potential difficulties can be circumvented, including vertex distance error and pantoscopic tilt error (inducing effective refraction changes), as well as prob&#173;lems caused by oblique (marginal) astigmatism and chromatic aberration (if lens material remains the same). Overrefraction may be performed with loose lenses (using trial lens clips such as Halberg trial clips), with a standard phoropter in front of the patient’s glasses, or with some automated refracting instruments.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the patient is wearing spherical lenses, the new prescription is easy to calculate by combining the current spherical correction with the spherocylindrical overrefraction. If the current lenses are spherocylindrical and the cylinder axis of the overrefraction is not at 0° or 90° to the pres&#173;ent correction, other methods previously discussed are used to determine the resultant refraction. Such lens combinations &#173;were often determined with a <span class="italic">lensmeter</span> used to read the resultant lens power through the combinations of the old glasses and the overrefraction correction. This procedure is awkward and prone to error &#173;because the lenses may rotate with re&#173;spect to one another on transfer to the lensmeter. Manual calculation is pos&#173;si&#173;ble but complicated. Programmable calculators can be used to perform the trigonometric combination of cylinders at oblique axes, but they may not be readily available in the clinic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Overrefraction has other uses. For example, a patient wearing a soft toric contact lens may undergo overrefraction for the purpose of ordering new lenses. An overrefraction is especially useful for patients wearing rigid, gas-&#173;permeable, hard contact lenses for irregular corneal astigmatism or corneal transplants. This may be used to determine the amount of visual reduction that is caused by irregular astigmatism. Overrefraction can also be used in the retinoscopic examination of &#173;children.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Spectacle Correction of Ametropias</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top9"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Ametropia</span> is a refractive error; it is the absence of emmetropia. The most common method of correcting refractive error is through prescription of spectacle lenses.</p>
			<p class="h2">Spherical Correcting Lenses and the Far Point Concept</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The far point plane of the nonaccommodated eye is conjugate with the ret&#173;ina. For a &#173;simple lens (plus or minus sphere), distant objects (&#173;those at optical infinity) come into sharp focus at the <span class="italic">secondary focal point</span> (F<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">2</span>) of the lens. To correct the refractive error of an eye, a correcting lens must place the image it forms (or its F<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">2</span>) at the eye’s far point. The image at the far point plane becomes the object that is focused onto the ret&#173;ina. For example, in a myopic eye, the far point lies somewhere in front of the eye, between it and optical infinity. In this case, the correct <span class="italic">diverging lens</span> forms a virtual image of distant objects at its F<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">2</span>, coincident with the far point of the eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-20</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The same princi&#173;ple holds for the correction of hyperopia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-21</span>). However, &#173;because the far point plane of a hyperopic eye is &#173;behind the ret&#173;ina, a <span class="italic">converging lens</span> must be chosen with appropriate power to focus parallel rays of light to the far point plane.</p>
			<p class="h2">The Importance of Vertex Distance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For any spherical correcting lens, the distance from the lens to its focal point is constant. Changing the position of the correcting lens relative to the eye also changes the relationship between the F<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">2</span> of the correcting lens and the far point plane of the eye. With high-&#173;power lenses, as used in the spectacle correction of aphakia or high myopia, a small change in the placement of the lens produces considerable blurring of vision &#173;unless the lens power is altered to compensate for the new lens position so that the secondary focal point of the lens coincides with the far point of the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With refractive errors greater than <span class="symbol">±</span>5.00 D, the vertex distance must be accounted for in prescribing the power of the spectacle lens. A <span class="italic">distometer</span> (also called a <span class="italic">vertexometer</span>) is used to mea&#173;sure the distance from the back surface of the spectacle lens to the cornea with the eyelid closed (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-22A</span>). Moving a correcting lens closer to the eye—&#173;whether the lens has plus or minus power—&#173;reduces its effective focusing power (the image moves posteriorly away from the fovea), whereas moving it farther from the eye increases its focusing power (the image moves anteriorly away from the fovea).</p>
			<p class="body-text">For example, in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;4-23</span> the <span class="symbol">+</span>10.00 D lens placed 10&#160;mm in front of the cornea provides sharp ret&#173;i&#173;nal imagery. &#173;Because the focal point of the correcting lens is identical to the far point plane of the eye and &#173;because this lens is placed 10&#160;mm in front of the eye, the far point plane of the eye must be 90&#160;mm &#173;behind the cornea. If the correcting lens is moved to a new position 20&#160;mm in front of the eye and the far point plane of the eye is 90&#160;mm &#173;behind the cornea, then the focal length of the new lens must be 110&#160;mm, requiring a <span class="symbol">+</span>9.10 D lens for correction. A contact lens &#173;will need to have a power of 11.10&#160;D. This example demonstrates the significance of vertex distance in spectacle correction of large refractive errors. Thus, the prescription must indicate not only the lens power but also the vertex distance at which the refraction was performed. The optician must recalculate the lens power as necessary for the &#173;actual vertex distance of the chosen spectacle–&#173;frame combination. <span class="xref-clin">Clinical Example 4-3</span> also demonstrates examples of vertex distance.</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-18"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="OPERATOR_BCSC1819_S03_C04_p147-204_4P-web-resources/image/2.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text">Allowing for vertex distance with the phoropter is made easier due to 2 commonly found features. The first feature is that the lenses within the phoropter, even though found in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent planes, have their power referenced to the back surface of the most posterior lens in the system. The second feature is that if the cornea of the eye is aligned at the zero mark on the corneal alignment tool (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-22B</span>), the vertex distance equals that assumed for the phoropter (13.75&#160;mm for the Reichert Phoroptor) and has an accompanying &#173;table with the proper conversion for each mm anterior or posterior that the cornea is positioned. The patient should be refracted in a trial frame or overrefracted in their current spectacles if the vertex distance varies significantly (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>6 mm) from that assumed in the phoropter.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cylindrical Correcting Lenses and the Far Point Concept</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The far point princi&#173;ples used in the correction of hyperopia and myopia are also employed in the correction of astigmatism with spectacle lenses. However, in astigmatism, the required lens power must be determined separately for each of the 2 principal meridians.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cylinders in spectacle lenses produce both monocular and binocular distortion. The primary cause is <span class="italic">meridional aniseikonia</span>—&#173;that is, unequal magnification of ret&#173;i&#173;nal images in the vari&#173;ous meridians. Although aniseikonia may be decreased by iseikonic spectacles, such corrections may be complicated and expensive, and most prac&#173;ti&#173;tion&#173;ers prefer to prescribe cylinders according to their clinical judgment. Clinical experience also suggests that adult patients vary in their ability to tolerate distortion, whereas young &#173;children always adapt to their cylindrical corrections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following guidelines may prove helpful in prescribing astigmatic spectacle corrections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-19">For <span class="italic">&#173;children,</span> prescribe the full astigmatic correction at the correct axis.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19">For <span class="italic">adults,</span> try the full correction initially. Give the patient a “walking-&#173;around” trial with trial frames before prescribing, if appropriate. (The experience of seeing the effects of motion is an impor&#173;tant part of this process—&#173;just sitting in a chair with the proposed prescription in trial frames is not an adequate test.) Inform the patient about the need for adaptation. To reduce distortion, use minus cylinder lenses (now standard) and minimize vertex distance.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19">&#173;Because spatial distortion from astigmatic spectacles is a binocular phenomenon, occlude 1 eye to verify that spatial distortion is the cause of the patient’s difficulty.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19">If necessary, reduce distortion by rotating the axis of the cylinder &#173;toward 180° or 90° (or &#173;toward the old axis) and/or reduce the cylinder power. Adjust the sphere to maintain spherical equivalent, but rely on a final subjective check to obtain the most satisfactory visual result.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-19">If distortion cannot be reduced sufficiently, consider contact lenses or iseikonic corrections.</li>

			<p class="h1">Prescribing for Children</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top10"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The correction of ametropia in &#173;children pres&#173;ents several special and challenging prob&#173;lems. In adults, the correction of refractive errors has 1 mea&#173;sur&#173;able endpoint: the best-&#173;corrected visual acuity. Prescribing visual correction for &#173;children often has 2 goals: providing a focused ret&#173;i&#173;nal image and achieving the optimal balance between accommodation and convergence.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some young patients, <span class="italic">subjective refraction</span> may be impossible or inappropriate, often &#173;because of the child’s inability to cooperate with subjective refraction techniques. In addition, the optimal refraction in infants or small &#173;children (particularly &#173;those with esotropia) requires the <span class="italic">paralysis of accommodation</span> with complete cycloplegia. In such cases, objective techniques such as retinoscopy are the best way to determine the refractive correction. Moreover, the presence of <span class="italic">strabismus</span> may require modification of the normal prescribing guidelines.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-17">Myopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are 2 types of childhood myopia: <span class="italic">congenital</span> (usually high) myopia and <span class="italic">developmental</span> myopia, which usually manifests itself between the ages of 7 and 10&#160;years. Developmental myopia is less severe and easier to manage &#173;because the patients are older and refraction is less difficult. However, both forms of myopia are progressive; frequent refractions (&#173;every 6–12 months) and periodic prescription changes are necessary. The following are general guidelines for correction of significant childhood myopia:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-19">Cycloplegic refractions are mandatory. In infants, &#173;children with esotropia, and &#173;children with very high myopia (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>10.00 D), atropine refraction may be necessary if tropicamide or cyclopentolate fails to paralyze accommodation in the office.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19">In general, the full refractive error, including cylinder, should be corrected. Young &#173;children tolerate cylinder well.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19">Some ophthalmologists undercorrect myopia, and &#173;others use bifocal lenses with or without atropine, based on the theory that accommodation hastens or increases the development of myopia. This topic remains controversial among ophthalmologists. (See BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>.)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19">Intentional undercorrection of a child’s myopic esotropia to decrease the &#173;angle of deviation is rarely tolerated.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19">Intentional overcorrection of a myopic error (or undercorrection of a hyperopic error) may help control intermittent exodeviations. However, such overcorrection can cause additional accommodative stress.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19">Parents should be educated about the natu&#173;ral progression of myopia and the need for frequent refractions and pos&#173;si&#173;ble prescription changes.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">In older &#173;children, contact lenses may be desirable to avoid the prob&#173;lem of image minification that arises with high-&#173;minus lenses.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-17">Hyperopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The appropriate correction of childhood hyperopia is more complex than that of myopia for 2 reasons. First, &#173;children who are significantly hyperopic (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>5.00 D) are more visually impaired than are their myopic counter&#173;parts, who can at least see clearly at near. Second, childhood hyperopia is more frequently associated with strabismus and abnormalities of the <span class="italic">accommodative convergence/accommodation (AC/A) </span>ratio (see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>). The following are general guidelines for correcting childhood hyperopia:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-19">&#173;Unless &#173;there is esodeviation or evidence of reduced vision, it is not necessary to correct low hyperopia. Most &#173;children have very high amplitude of accommodation. As with myopia, significant astigmatic errors should be fully corrected.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19">When hyperopia and esotropia coexist, initial management includes full correction of the cycloplegic refractive error. Reductions in the amount of correction may be appropriate &#173;later, depending on the amount of esotropia and level of stereopsis with the full cycloplegic correction in place.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">In a school-&#173;aged child, the full refractive correction may cause blurring of distance vision &#173;because of the inability to relax accommodation fully. Reducing the amount of correction is sometimes necessary for the child to accept the glasses. A short course of cycloplegia may help a child accept the hyperopic correction.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Anisometropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A child or infant with anisometropia is typically prescribed the full refractive difference between the 2 eyes, regardless of age, presence or amount of strabismus, or degree of anisometropia. Anisometropic amblyopia is frequently pres&#173;ent and may require occlusion therapy. <span class="italic">Bilateral amblyopia</span> occasionally occurs when &#173;there is significant hyperopia, myopia, and/or astigmatism in both eyes. Refractive amblyopia is less common with bilateral myopia &#173;because &#173;these patients have clear near vision.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-20">Clinical Accommodative Problems</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top11"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See Chapter&#160;3 for a discussion of the terminology and mechanisms of accommodation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Presbyopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Presbyopia is the gradual loss of accommodative response resulting from reduced elasticity of the crystalline lens. Accommodative amplitude diminishes with age. It becomes a clinical prob&#173;lem when the remaining accommodative amplitude is insufficient for the patient to read and carry out near-&#173;vision tasks comfortably. Fortunately, appropriate convex lenses can compensate for the waning of accommodative power.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Symptoms of presbyopia usually begin to appear in patients &#173;after 40&#160;years of age. The age of onset depends on preexisting refractive error, depth of focus (pupil size), the patient’s visual tasks, and other variables. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;4-3</span> pres&#173;ents a simplified overview of age norms. The KAMRA corneal Inlay (AcuFocus Inc, Irvine, CA) has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the correction of presbyopia through the use of pinhole optics. The inlay is 3.8&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter and has a 1.6-mm aperture.</p>
			<p class="h2">Accommodative Insufficiency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Accommodative insufficiency is the premature loss of accommodative amplitude. This prob&#173;lem may manifest itself by blurring of near visual objects (as in presbyopia) or by the inability to sustain accommodative effort. The onset may be heralded by the appearance of asthenopic symptoms; the ultimate development is blurred near vision. Such “premature presbyopia” may signify concurrent or past debilitating illness, or it may be induced by medi&#173;cations such as tranquilizing drugs or the parasympatholytics used in treating some gastrointestinal disorders. In both cases, the condition may be reversible; however, permanent accommodative insufficiency may be associated with neurogenic disorders such as encephalitis or closed-&#173;head trauma. In some cases, the etiology may never be determined. &#173;These patients require additional reading plus power for near vision. The most common &#173;causes of premature presbyopia, however, are unrecognized (latent) hyperopia and overcorrected myopia.</p>
			<p class="h2">Accommodative Excess</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Ciliary muscle spasm,</span> often incorrectly termed spasm of accommodation, &#173;causes accommodative excess. A ciliary spasm has characteristic symptoms: headache, brow ache, variable blurring of distance vision, and an abnormally close near point. Ciliary spasm may be a manifestation of local disease such as iridocyclitis; it may be caused by medi&#173;cations such as the anticholinesterases used in the treatment of glaucoma; or it may be associated with uncorrected refractive errors, usually hyperopia but also astigmatism. In some patients, ciliary spasm exacerbates preexisting myopia. Postcycloplegic refraction often helps determine the patient’s true refractive error in such cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ciliary spasm may also occur &#173;after prolonged and intense periods of near work. <span class="italic">Spasm of the near reflex</span> is a characteristic clinical syndrome often observed in tense or anxious persons who pres&#173;ent with (1) excess accommodation, (2) excess convergence, and (3) miosis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Accommodative Convergence/Accommodation Ratio</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Normally, accommodative effort is accompanied by a corresponding convergence effort. For practical purposes, the AC/A ratio is ordinarily expressed in terms of prism diopters of deviation per diopter of accommodation. Using this type of expression, the normal AC/A ratio is 3:1–5:1.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The AC/A ratio is relatively constant in a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar patient, but it should be noted that &#173;there is some variability among individuals. For example, a patient with an uncorrected 1.00 D of hyperopia may accommodate 1.00 D for clear distance vision without exercising a convergence effort. Conversely, a patient with uncorrected myopia must converge without accommodative effort to fuse at the far point.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The AC/A ratio can be mea&#173;sured by varying the stimulus to accommodation in several ways. &#173;These methods are described in the following subsections.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Heterophoria method</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The heterophoria method involves moving the fixation target. The heterophoria is mea&#173;sured at 6&#160;m and again at 0.33&#160;m.</p>

			<p class="h2">Effect of Spectacle and Contact Lens Correction on Accommodation and&#160;Convergence</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Both accommodation and convergence requirements differ between contact lenses and spectacle lenses. The effects become more noticeable as the power of the correction increases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Let us first consider accommodative requirements (see Chapter&#160;5). Recall that &#173;because of vertex distance considerations, particularly with high-&#173;power corrections, the dioptric power of the distance correction in the spectacle plane is dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from that in the contact lens plane: for a near object held at a constant distance, the amount that an eye needs to accommodate depends on the location of the refractive correction relative to the cornea. Patients with myopia must accommodate more for a given near object when wearing contact lenses than when wearing glasses. For example, patients in their early 40s with myopia who switch from single-&#173;vision glasses to contact lenses may suddenly experience presbyopic symptoms. The reverse is true with patients with hyperopia; spectacle correction requires more accommodation for a given near object than does contact lens correction. Patients with spectacle-&#173;corrected high myopia, when presbyopic, need only weak bifocal add power or none at all. For example, a patient with high myopia who wears <span class="symbol">−</span>20.00 D glasses needs to accommodate only approximately 1.00 D to see an object at 33&#160;cm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Now let us consider convergence requirements and refractive correction. &#173;Because contact lenses move with the eyes and spectacles do not, dif&#173;fer&#173;ent amounts of convergence are required for viewing near objects. Spectacle correction gives a myopic patient a base-in prism effect when converging and thus reduces the patient’s requirement for convergence. (Fortunately, this reduction parallels the lessened requirement for accommodation.) In contrast, a patient with spectacle-&#173;corrected hyperopia encounters a base-&#173;out prism effect that increases the requirement for convergence. This effect is beneficial in the correction of residual esotropia at near in patients with hyperopia and accommodative esotropia. &#173;These effects may be the source of a patient’s symptoms on switching between glasses and contact lenses (see <span class="xref-clin">Clinical Example 5-2</span>).</p>

			<p class="h1">Prescribing Multifocal Lenses</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top12"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A multifocal lens has 2 or more refractive ele&#173;ments. The power of each segment is prescribed separately.</p>
			<p class="h2">Determining the Add Power of a Bifocal Lens</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The information necessary to prescribe bifocal lenses includes (1) an accurate baseline refraction, (2) the accommodative amplitude, and (3) the patient’s social or occupational activities that require near-&#173;vision correction (eg, reading, sewing, or computer use).</p>
			<p class="h3">Mea&#173;sur&#173;ing accommodative amplitude</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Any of the following tests can provide useful information for determining the accommodative amplitude: (1) the near point of accommodation with accurate distance refractive correction in place, (2) the accommodative rule (eg, with a Prince rule [Royal Air Force Rule]), and (3) the use of plus and minus spheres at near distance &#173;until the fixation target blurs. <span class="italic">Binocular amplitude of accommodation</span> is normally greater than the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment for &#173;either eye alone by 0.50–1.00 D.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Near point of accommodation</span> A practical method for mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the near point of accommodation is to have the patient fixate on a near target (usually small print such as 5-&#173;point or Jaeger 2 type print) and move the test card &#173;toward the eye &#173;until the print blurs. If the eye is emmetropic (or rendered emmetropic by proper refractive correction), then the far point of the eye is at infinity and the near point can be converted into diopters of amplitude.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This method is subject to certain errors, including the apparent increased amplitude resulting from angular magnification of the letters as they approach the eye. In addition, if the eye is ametropic and not corrected for distance, the near point of accommodation cannot be converted into diopters of amplitude. In the following examples, each eye has 3 D of accommodative amplitude:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-19">A person with emmetropia would have a near point of 33&#160;cm and a far point at optical infinity.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19">A patient with an uncorrected 3.00 D of myopia would have a near point at 16.7&#160;cm &#173;because at the far point of 33&#160;cm, no accommodation is needed.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">A patient with an uncorrected 3.00 D of hyperopia would have a near point at infinity &#173;because all of the available accommodation is needed to overcome the hyperopia.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Accommodative rule</span> Amplitude of accommodation can be mea&#173;sured with a device such as a Prince rule (Royal Air Force Rule) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-24</span>), which combines a reading card with a ruler calibrated in centimeters and diopters. Placing a <span class="symbol">+</span>3.00 D lens before the emmetropic (or accurately corrected ametropic) eye places the far point of accommodation at 33&#160;cm, and the near point is also brought closer by a corresponding 3.00 D. The amplitude is then determined by subtraction of the far point (in diopters) from the near point (in diopters).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Method of spheres</span> Amplitude of accommodation may also be mea&#173;sured by having the patient fixate on a reading target at 40&#160;cm. Accommodation is stimulated by the placement of successively stronger minus spheres before the eye &#173;until the print blurs; accommodation is then relaxed by the use of successively stronger plus lenses &#173;until blurring begins. The difference between the 2 lenses is a mea&#173;sure of accommodative amplitude. For example, if the patient accepts <span class="symbol">−</span>3.00 D to blur (stimulus to accommodation) and <span class="symbol">+</span>2.50 D to blur (relaxation of accommodation), the amplitude is 5.50 D.</p>
			<p class="h3">Range of accommodation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Determining the range of accommodation, like mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the amplitude of accommodation, is valuable in ensuring that the prescribed bifocal add power meets the patient’s visual needs. The range of accommodation mea&#173;sures the useful range of clear vision when a given lens is employed. For this purpose, a mea&#173;sur&#173;ing tape, meter stick, or accommodation rule may be used.</p>
			<p class="h3">Selecting an add power</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Determine the amount of accommodation required for the patient’s near-&#173;vision tasks. For example, reading at 40&#160;cm would require 2.50 D of accommodation. From the patient’s mea&#173;sured accommodative amplitude, allow one-&#173;half to be held in reserve. This reserve allows for some comfortable movement should the patient move the reading material &#173;either closer or farther away from the optimal reading distance. For instance, if the patient has 2.00 D of accommodation, 1.00 D may be comfortably contributed by the patient. (Some patients may use more than one-&#173;half of their available accommodation with comfort.) Subtract the patient’s available accommodation (1.00 D) from the total amount of accommodation required (2.50 D); the difference (1.50 D) is the approximate additional plus &#173;lens power (add) needed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Place a lens with this add power in front of the distance refractive correction, and mea&#173;sure the range of accommodation (near point to far point of accommodation in centimeters). Does this range adequately meet the requirements of the patient’s near-&#173;vision activities? If the accommodative range is too close, reduce the add power in increments of 0.25 D &#173;until the range is appropriate for the patient’s requirement. &#173;Because binocular accommodative amplitude is usually 0.50–1.00 D greater than the monocular mea&#173;sure&#173;ment, using the binocular mea&#173;sure&#173;ment generally guards against prescribing an add power that is too high.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-23">Types of Bifocal Lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most bifocal lenses currently dispensed are 1-&#173;piece lenses that are made by generating the dif&#173;fer&#173;ent refracting surfaces on a single lens blank (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-25</span>). One-&#173;piece <span class="italic">round segment bifocal lenses</span> have their segment on the concave surface. One-&#173;piece <span class="italic">molded plastic bifocal lenses</span> are available in vari&#173;ous shapes, including (1) round top with button on convex surface, (2) flat top with button on convex surface, and (3) Franklin (executive) style with split bifocal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With <span class="italic">fused bifocal lenses,</span> the increased refracting power of the bifocal segment is produced by fusing a button of glass that has a higher refractive index than the basic crown glass lens into a countersink in the crown glass lens blank. With all such bifocal lenses, the add segment is fused into the convex surface of the lens; astigmatic corrections, when necessary, are ground on the concave surface.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-23">Trifocal Lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A bifocal lens may not fully satisfy all the visual needs of an older patient with limited accommodation. Even when near and distant ranges are corrected appropriately, vision is not clear in the intermediate range, approximately at arm’s length. The loss of intermediate-&#173;range vision may be exacerbated by a stronger bifocal add than is needed. This prob&#173;lem can be solved with trifocal spectacles, which incorporate a third segment of intermediate strength (typically one-&#173;half the power of the reading add) between the distance correction and the reading segment. The intermediate segment allows the patient to focus on objects beyond the reading distance but closer than 1&#160;m (<span class="xref-clin">Clinical Example 4-4</span>.) In con&#173;temporary practice, progressive addition lenses have supplanted trifocals in most instances.</p>

			<p class="h2">Progressive Addition Lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Both bifocal and trifocal lenses have an abrupt change in power as the line of sight passes across the boundary between one portion of the lens and the next; image jump and diplopia can occur at the segment lines. Progressive addition lenses (PALs) avoid &#173;these difficulties by supplying power gradually as the line of sight is depressed &#173;toward the reading level. Unlike bifocal and trifocal lenses, PALs offer clear vision at all focal distances. Other advantages of PALs include lack of intermediate blur and absence of any vis&#173;i&#173;ble segment lines.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The PAL form has 4 types of optical zones on the convex surface: a spherical distance zone, a reading zone, a transition zone (or “<span class="italic">corridor</span>”), and zones of peripheral distortion. The progressive change in lens power is generated on the convex surface of the lens by progressive aspheric changes in curvature from the top to the bottom of the lens. The concave surface is reserved for the cylinder of the patient’s distance lens prescription, as in traditional minus cylinder lens designs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, &#173;there are certain drawbacks to PALs. Most notably, some degree of peripheral distortion is inherent in the design of all PALs. This peripheral aberration is caused by astigmatism resulting from the changing aspheric curves; &#173;these curves are most pronounced in the lower inner and outer quadrants of the lens. &#173;These distortions produce a “swimming” sensation with head movement.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The vertical meridian joining the distance and reading optical centers is &#173;free of surface astigmatism and provides the optimal visual acuity. To &#173;either side of this distortion-&#173;free vertical meridian, induced astigmatism and a concomitant degradation of visual acuity occur. If the lens is designed such that the peripheral distortions are spread out over a relatively wide portion of the lens, &#173;there is a concomitant decrease in the distortion-&#173;free principal zones. This effect is the basis of <span class="italic">soft-&#173;design PALs</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-26</span>). Conversely, a wider distortion-&#173;free zone for distance and reading means a more intense lateral deformity. This effect is the basis of hard-&#173;design PALs. If the transition corridor is lengthened, the distortions are less pronounced, but prob&#173;lems arise &#173;because of the greater vertical separation between the distance optical center and the reading zone. Therefore, each PAL design represents a series of compromises. Some manufacturers prefer less distortion at the expense of less useful aberration-&#173;free distance and near visual acuity; &#173;others opt for maximum acuity over a wider usable area, with smaller but more pronounced lateral distortion zones.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Good candidates for progressive lenses may be patients with new presbyopia who have not experienced traditional lined bifocals or trifocals, &#173;those who only occasionally need intermediate vision, and &#173;those with strong aversions to lined lenses. Less successful candidates are &#173;those who are currently happy with other alternatives (lined bifocals/trifocals or single vision correction), anisometropia, and &#173;those requiring prism or high adds, a large field of view, or multiple near-&#173;fixation lines of sight, or &#173;those who have very mobile/dynamic eye movements (sports). Personality may play a role in ac&#173;cep&#173;tance of &#173;these lenses, and &#173;those &#173;factors should be taken into consideration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fitting of &#173;these lenses is a critical pro&#173;cess. Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of pupillary distance should be performed monocularly, as any asymmetry must be accounted for. Frame se&#173;lection is impor&#173;tant. The frame must have adequate vertical depth to allow the full progressive add to be pres&#173;ent. The distance and near reference areas should be marked with the frame in place. Frames with adjustable nose pads allow &#173;future adjustment of the PAL position. A shorter back vertex distance &#173;will give greater binocular field of vision. Greater pantoscopic tilt gives increased near visual field but must be accounted for in the effective lens power.</p>
			<p class="body-text">PALs are readily available from <span class="symbol">−</span>8.00 to <span class="symbol">+</span>7.50 D spheres and up to 4.00 D cylinders; the available add powers are from <span class="symbol">+</span>1.50 to <span class="symbol">+</span>3.50 D. Some vendors also make custom lenses with par&#173;ameters outside &#173;these limits. Prism can be incorporated into PALs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The best candidates for PALs are patients with early presbyopia who have not previously worn bifocal lenses, patients who do not require wide near-&#173;vision fields, and highly motivated patients. Patients who change from conventional multifocal lenses to PALs should be advised that distortion &#173;will be pres&#173;ent and that adaptation &#173;will be necessary. Small-&#173;frame PALs can reduce the usable reading zone to a small area at the bottom edge of the lens. Also, the differential magnification through the progressive zone can make computer screens appear trapezoidal. Progressive designs are also available for indoor use, with large zones devoted to computer monitor and reading distances (eg, 23 inches and 16 inches from the eye).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-25">The Prentice Rule and Bifocal Lens Design</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are special considerations when prescribing lenses for patients with significant anisometropias.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Prismatic effects of lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All lenses act as prisms when one looks through the lens at any point other than the optical center. The amount of the induced prismatic effect depends on the power of the lens and the distance from the optical center. Specifically, the amount of prismatic effect (mea&#173;sured in prism diopters) is equal to the distance (in centimeters) from the optical center multiplied by the lens power (in diopters). This equation is known as the <span class="italic">Prentice rule:</span></p>
			<p class="equation-single"><span class="greek CharOverride-1">Δ</span> <span class="symbol">=</span> <span class="eq--italic-">hD</span></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">where</p>
			<p class="equation-first"><span class="greek CharOverride-1">Δ</span> <span class="symbol">=</span> prismatic effect (in prism diopters)</p>
			<p class="equation-mid"><span class="eq--italic-">h</span> <span class="symbol">=</span> distance from the optical center (in centimeters)</p>
			<p class="equation-mid"><span class="eq--italic-">D</span> <span class="symbol">=</span> lens power (in diopters)</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Image displacement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When reading at near through a point below the optical center, a patient wearing spectacle lenses of unequal power may notice vertical double vision. With a bifocal segment, the gaze is usually directed 8–10&#160;mm below and 1.5–3.0&#160;mm nasal to the distance optical center of the distance lens (in the following examples, we assume the usual 8&#160;mm down and 2&#160;mm nasal). As long as the bifocal segments are of the same power and type, the induced, vertical prismatic displacement is determined by the powers of the distance lens alone.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the lens powers are the same for the 2 eyes, the displacement of each is the same (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 4-27</span>, <span class="xref-figure">4-28</span>). However, if the patient’s vision is anisometropic, a phoria is induced by the unequal prismatic displacement of the 2 lenses (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 4-29</span>, <span class="xref-figure">4-30</span>). The amount of <span class="italic">vertical phoria</span> is determined by subtracting the smaller prismatic displacement from the larger if both lenses are myopic or hyperopic (see Fig&#160;4-29) or by adding the 2 lenses if the patient is hyperopic in 1 eye and myopic in the other (see Fig&#160;4-30).</p>
			<p class="body-text">For determination of the induced <span class="italic">horizontal phoria,</span> the induced prisms are added if both eyes are hyperopic or if both eyes are myopic. If 1 eye is hyperopic and the other is myopic, the smaller amount of prismatic displacement is subtracted from the larger (see Fig&#160;4-30). Image displacement is minimized when round-&#173;top segment bifocal lenses are used with plus lenses and flat-&#173;top segment bifocal lenses are used with minus lenses (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-31</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Image jump</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The usual position of the top of a bifocal segment is 5&#160;mm below the optical center of the distance lens. As the eyes are directed downward through a lens, the prismatic displacement of the image increases (downward in plus lenses, upward in minus lenses). When the eyes encounter the top of a bifocal segment, they meet a new plus lens with a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent optical center, and the object appears to jump upward &#173;unless the optical center of the add is at the very top of the segment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-32</span>). Executive-&#173;style segments have their optical centers at the top of the segment. The optical center of a typical flat-&#173;top segment is located 3&#160;mm below the top of the segment. The closer the optical center of the segment approaches the top edge of the segment, the less the image jump. Thus, flat-&#173;top segments produce less image jump than do round-&#173;top segments &#173;because the latter have much lower optical centers. Patients with myopia who wear round-&#173;top bifocal lenses would be more bothered by image jump than would patients with hyperopia &#173;because the jump occurs in the direction of image displacement.</p>
			<p class="h3">Compensating for induced anisophoria</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When anisometropia is corrected with spectacle lenses, unequal prism is introduced in all secondary positions of gaze. This prism may be the source of symptoms, even diplopia. <span class="italic">Symptomatic anisophoria</span> occurs especially when a patient with early presbyopia uses his or her first pair of bifocal lenses or when the anisometropia is of recent and/or sudden origin, as occurs &#173;after ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment surgery, with gradual asymmetric progression of cataracts, or &#173;after unilateral intraocular lens implantation. The patient usually adapts to horizontal imbalance by increasing head rotation but may have symptoms when looking down, in the reading position. Recall that horizontal vergence amplitudes are large compared with vertical fusional amplitudes, which are typically less than 2<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">Δ</span>. We can calculate the amount of induced phoria by using the Prentice rule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-33</span>; <span class="xref-clin">Clinical Example 4-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-26"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-7" src="OPERATOR_BCSC1819_S03_C04_p147-204_4P-web-resources/image/4.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text">The correction of induced vertical prism may be accomplished in several ways:</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h4-head">Press-on (Fresnel) prisms</span> With press-on prisms, 2.00<span class="greek CharOverride-1">Δ</span> of base down (BD) prism may be added to the right segment in the preceding example or 2.00<span class="greek CharOverride-1">Δ</span> of base up (BU) prism to the left segment.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h4-head">Slab-&#173;off</span> The most satisfactory method of compensating for the induced vertical phoria in anisometropia is the technique of bicentric grinding, known as <span class="italic">slab-&#173;off</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-34</span>). In this method, 2 optical centers are created in the lens that has the greater minus (or less plus) power, thereby counteracting the base-&#173;down effect of the greater minus lens in the reading position. It is con&#173;ve&#173;nient to think of the slab-&#173;off pro&#173;cess as creating <span class="italic">base-up prism</span> (or removing base-&#173;down prism—&#173;slab-&#173;off) over the reading area of the lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Bicentric grinding is used for single-&#173;vision lenses as well as for multifocal lenses. By increasing the distance between the 2 optical centers, this method achieves as much as 4.00<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">Δ</span> of prism compensation at the reading position.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h4-head">Reverse slab-&#173;off</span> Prism correction in the reading position is achieved not only by removing <span class="italic">base-&#173;down prism</span> from the lower part of the more minus lens (slabbing off) but also by adding base-&#173;down prism to the lower half of the more plus lens. This technique is known as <span class="italic">reverse slab-&#173;off.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Historically, it was easy to remove material from a standard lens. Currently, &#173;because plastic lenses are fabricated by molding, it is more con&#173;ve&#173;nient to add material to create a base-&#173;down prism in the lower half of what &#173;will be the more plus lens. &#173;Because plastic lenses account for most lenses dispensed, reverse slab-&#173;off is the most common method of correcting anisometropically induced anisophoria. In theory, a minus powered spectacle lens &#173;will have less edge thickness with slab-&#173;off than with reverse slab-&#173;off.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When the clinician is ordering a lens that requires prism correction for an anisophoria in downgaze, it is often appropriate to leave the choice of slab-&#173;off versus reverse slab-&#173;off to the optician by including a statement in the prescription, such as, “Slab-&#173;off right lens 3.00<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">Δ</span> (or reverse slab-&#173;off left lens).” In &#173;either case, the prescribed prism should be mea&#173;sured in the reading position, not calculated, &#173;because the patient may have partially adapted to the anisophoria.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h4-head">Dissimilar segments</span> In anisometropic bifocal lens prescriptions, vertical prism compensation can also be achieved by using dissimilar bifocal segments with their optical centers at 2 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent heights. The segment with the lower optical center should be placed in front of the more hyperopic (or less myopic) eye to provide base-&#173;down prism. (This method contrasts with the bicentric grinding method, which produces base-up prism and is therefore employed on the lesser plus or greater minus lens.)</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the example in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;4-35</span>, a 22-mm round segment is used for the right eye, and the top of its segment is at the usual 5&#160;mm below the distance optical center. For the left eye, a 22-mm flat-&#173;top segment is used, again with the top of the segment 5&#160;mm below the optical center.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because the optical center of the flat-&#173;top segment is 3&#160;mm below the top of the segment, it is at the patient’s reading position and that segment &#173;will introduce no prismatic effect. However, for the right eye, the optical center of the round segment is 8&#160;mm below the patient’s reading position; according to the Prentice rule, this 2.50 D segment &#173;will produce 2.50 <span class="symbol">×</span> 0.8 <span class="symbol">=</span> 2.00<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">Δ</span> base-&#173;down prism.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h4-head">Single-&#173;vision reading glasses with lowered optical centers</span> Partial compensation for the induced vertical phoria at the reading position can be obtained with single-&#173;vision reading glasses when the optical centers are placed 3–4&#160;mm below the pupillary centers in primary gaze. The patient’s gaze &#173;will be directed much closer to the optical centers of the lenses when reading.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-12"><span class="h4-head">Contact lenses</span> Contact lenses can be prescribed for patients with significant anisometropia that &#173;causes a symptomatic anisophoria in downgaze. Reading glasses can be worn over the contacts if the patient’s vision is presbyopic.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-12"><span class="h4-head">Refractive surgery</span> Corneal refractive surgery may be an option for some patients with symptomatic anisometropia or anisophoria.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Occupation and Bifocal Segment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">dioptric power</span> of a segment depends on the patient’s accommodative reserve and the working distance required for a specific job. Such focal length determinations are a characteristic not of the job but of the individual patient’s adaptation to that job. If the patient is allowed to use half of his or her available accommodation (which must be mea&#173;sured), the remainder of the dioptric requirement &#173;will be met by the bifocal add. For example, if the job entails proofreading at 40&#160;cm, the dioptric requirement for that focal length is 2.50&#160;D. If the patient’s accommodative amplitude is 2.00 D, and half of that (1.00 D) is used for the job, the balance of 1.50 D becomes the necessary bifocal add. It is essential that the accommodative range (near point to far point) be mea&#173;sured and that it be adequate for the job tasks.</p>
			<p class="h3">Lens design</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most impor&#173;tant characteristic of the bifocal segment is the <span class="italic">segment height</span> in relation to the patient’s pupillary center. The lenses &#173;will be unsuitable if the segment is placed too high or too low for the specific occupational need.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Segment width</span> is substantially less impor&#173;tant. The popu&#173;lar impression that very large bifocal lenses mean better reading capability is not supported by projection mea&#173;sure&#173;ments. At a 40-cm reading distance, a 25-mm flat-&#173;top segment provides a horizontal reading field of 50–55&#160;cm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">At a 40-cm distance, an individual habitually uses face rotation to increase his or her fixation field when it exceeds 45&#160;cm (30° of arc); therefore, a 25-&#173;mm-&#173;wide segment is more than adequate for all but a few special occupations, such as a graphic artist or an architectural drafter using a drawing board. Furthermore, with a 35-mm segment producing a horizontal field 75&#160;cm wide, the focal length at the extremes of the fixation field would be 55&#160;cm, not 40&#160;cm! Therefore, the split bifocal is useful not &#173;because it is a wider bifocal lens but &#173;because of its monocentric construction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">shape</span> of the segment must also be considered. For example, round-&#173;top segments require the user to look far enough down in the segment to employ his or her maximum horizontal dimension. In addition, &#173;these segments exaggerate image jump, especially in myopic corrections.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Segment decentration</span> To avoid inducing a base-&#173;out prism effect when the bifocal lens–&#173;wearing patient converges for near-&#173;vision tasks, the reading segment is generally decentered inward. This design is especially impor&#173;tant in aphakic spectacles. Consider the following points for proper decentration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-27"><span class="italic">Working distance.</span> &#173;Because the convergence requirement increases as the focal length decreases, additional inward decentration of the bifocal segment is required.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19"><span class="italic">Interpupillary distance.</span> The wider the interpupillary distance, the greater the convergence requirement and, correspondingly, the need for inward decentration of the segments.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19"><span class="italic">Lens power.</span> If the distance lens is a high-&#173;plus lens, it &#173;will create a greater base-&#173;out prism effect (ie, induced exophoria) as the viewer converges. Additional inward decentration of the segments may be helpful. The reverse is true for high-&#173;minus lenses.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-19"><span class="italic">Existing heterophoria.</span> As with lens-&#173;induced phorias, the presence of an existing exophoria suggests that increasing the inward decentration would be effective. An esophoria calls for the opposite approach.</li>

			<p class="body-text">In addition, aphakic spectacles create cosmetic prob&#173;lems.

			<p class="body-text">For &#173;these reasons, intraocular lenses and aphakic contact lenses now account for nearly all aphakic corrections. Nevertheless, spectacle correction of aphakia is sometimes appropriate, as in bilateral infantile pediatric aphakia.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Refracting technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because of the sensitivity of aphakic glasses to vertex distance and pantoscopic tilt, it is difficult to refract an aphakic eye reliably by using a phoropter. The vertex distance and the pantoscopic tilt are not well controlled, nor are they necessarily close to the values for the final spectacles. Rather than a phoropter, trial frames or lens clips are used.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The trial frame allows the refractionist to control vertex distance and pantoscopic tilt. It should be adjusted for minimal vertex distance and for the same pantoscopic tilt planned for the &#173;actual spectacles (approximately 5°–7°, not the larger values that are appropriate for conventional glasses). Pantoscopic tilt is desirable in spectacle lenses to maintain the vertex distance in downgaze. Excess tilt &#173;will induce oblique (marginal) astigmatism in the axis of rotation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Refracting with clip-on trial lens holders placed over the patient’s existing aphakic glasses (overrefraction) keeps vertex distance and lens tilt constant. Take care that the center of the clip coincides with the optical center of the existing lens. Even if the pres&#173;ent lens contains a cylinder at an axis dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from what is needed, it is pos&#173;si&#173;ble to calculate the resultant spherocylindrical correction with an electronic calculator, by hand, or with mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the combination in a lensmeter.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Absorptive Lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In certain high-&#173;illumination situations, sunglasses allow for better visual function in a number of ways.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Improvement of contrast sensitivity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">On a bright, sunny day, irradiance from the sun ranges from 10,000–30,000 foot-&#173;lamberts. &#173;These high light levels tend to saturate the ret&#173;ina and therefore decrease finer levels of contrast sensitivity. The major function of dark (gray, green, or brown) sunglasses is to allow the ret&#173;ina to remain at its normal level of contrast sensitivity. Most dark sunglasses absorb 70%–80% of the incident light of all wavelengths.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Improvement of dark adaptation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A full day at the beach or on the ski slopes on a sunny day (without dark sunglasses) can impair dark adaptation for more than 2 days. Thus, dark sunglasses are recommended for prolonged periods in bright sun.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Reduction of glare sensitivity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vari&#173;ous types of sunglasses can reduce glare sensitivity. &#173;Because light reflected off a horizontal surface is polarized in the horizontal plane, properly oriented <span class="italic">polarized lenses</span> reduce the intensity of glare from road surfaces, glass win&#173;dows, metal surfaces, and lake and river surfaces. <span class="italic">Graded-&#173;density sunglasses</span> are deeply tinted at the top and gradually become lighter &#173;toward the lens center. They are effective in removing glare from sources above the line of sight, such as the sun. Wide-&#173;temple sunglasses work by reducing glare from temporal light sources.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Use of photochromic lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When short-&#173;wavelength light (300–400<span class="symbol">+</span> nm) interacts with photochromic lenses, the lenses darken by means of a chemical reaction that converts silver ions to elemental silver. This pro&#173;cess is similar to the reaction that occurs when photographic film is exposed to light. Unlike that in photographic film, however, the chemical reaction in photochromic lenses is reversible. Current photochromic lenses incorporate complex organic compounds in which UV light changes the molecules into dif&#173;fer&#173;ent configuration states (ie, <span class="italic">cis</span> to <span class="italic">trans</span>); this pro&#173;cess darkens the lenses (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-37</span>). Photochromic lenses can darken enough to absorb approximately 80% of the incident light; when the amount of illumination falls, they can lighten to absorb only a small part of the incident light. Note that &#173;these lenses take some time to darken and, in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, take longer to lighten than to darken. This discrepancy can be problematic in patients who move frequently between outdoor and indoor environments. &#173;Because automobile glass and the win&#173;dow glass in many residences and commercial buildings absorb light in the UV spectrum, most photochromics do not darken inside cars or buildings. In colder weather, patients should also be warned that &#173;these lenses darken more than usual, especially during a cloudy day. Nevertheless, photochromic lenses are excellent UV absorbers.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Ultraviolet-&#173;absorbing lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The spectrum of ultraviolet (UV) light is divided into 3 types: UVA contains wavelengths of 400–320&#160;nm, UVB contains wavelengths of 320–290&#160;nm, and UVC contains wavelengths below 290&#160;nm. The ozone layer of the atmosphere absorbs almost all UVC coming from the sun. Most exposure to UVC is from manufactured sources, including welding arcs, germicidal lamps, and excimer &#173;lasers. Of the total solar radiation falling on the earth, approximately 5% is UV light, of which 90% is UVA and 10% UVB.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The amount of UV light striking the earth varies with season (greatest in the summer), latitude (greatest near the equator), time of day (greatest at noon), and elevation (greatest at high elevation). UV light can also strike the eye by reflection. Fresh snow reflects between 60% and 80% of incident light; sand (beach, desert) reflects approximately 15% of incident light; and &#173;water reflects approximately 5% of incident light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Laboratory experiments have shown that UV light damages living tissue in 2 ways. First, chemicals such as proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, and cell-&#173;membrane components absorb UV light. When they do so, their molecular bonds (primarily the double bonds) may become disrupted. Second, &#173;these essential biochemicals may become disrupted by the action of &#173;free radicals (such as the superoxide radical). &#173;Free radicals can often be produced by UV light in the presence of oxygen and a photosensitizing pigment. For a fuller discussion of &#173;free radicals, see BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because it may take many years for UV light to damage eye tissue, a tight linkage between cause and effect is difficult to prove. Therefore, proof that UV light damages the eye comes primarily from acute animal experiments and epidemiologic studies covering large numbers of patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some surgeons routinely prescribe UV-&#173;absorbing glasses &#173;after surgery. Intraocular lenses incorporating UV-&#173;absorbing chromophores are now the norm. For further information regarding the effects of UV radiation on vari&#173;ous ocular structures, see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Almost all dark sunglasses absorb most incident UV light. The same is true for certain coated clear-&#173;glass lenses and clear plastic lenses made of CR-39 or polycarbonate. One suggestion has been that certain sunglasses (primarily light blue ones) may cause light damage to the eye. Proponents of this theory contended that the pupil dilates &#173;behind dark glasses and that if the sunglasses do not then absorb significant amounts of UV light, they &#173;will actually allow more UV light to enter the eye than if no sunglasses &#173;were worn. In fact, dark sunglasses reduce light levels striking the eye on a bright, sunny day to the range of 2000–6000 foot-&#173;lamberts. Such levels are approximately 10 times higher than &#173;those of an average lighted room. At such light levels, the pupil is significantly constricted. Thus, contrary to the preceding argument, dark sunglasses used on a bright day allow pupillary dilation of only a fraction of a millimeter and do not lead to light injury of the eye.</p>
			<p class="h2">Special Lens Materials</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is impor&#173;tant for the ophthalmologist to be aware of the variety of spectacle lens materials available. Four major properties are commonly discussed in relation to lens materials:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-29">1.&#9;<span class="italic">Index of refraction.</span> As the refractive index increases, the thickness of the lens can be decreased to obtain the same optical power.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;<span class="italic">Specific gravity.</span> As the specific gravity of a material decreases, the lens weight can be reduced.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;<span class="italic">Abbe number (value).</span> This value indicates the degree of chromatic aberration or distortion that occurs &#173;because of the dispersion of light, primarily with off-&#173;axis viewing. Materials with a higher Abbe number exhibit less chromatic aberration and thus allow for higher optical quality.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">4.&#9;<span class="italic">Impact re&#173;sis&#173;tance.</span> All lenses dispensed in the United States must meet impact-&#173;resistance requirements defined by the FDA (in 21CFR801.410), except in special cases wherein the physician or optometrist communicates in writing that such lenses would not fulfill the visual requirements of the par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar patient. Lenses used for occupational and educational personal eye protection must also meet the impact-&#173;resistance requirements defined in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) high-&#173;velocity impact standard (Z87.1). Lenses prescribed for &#173;children and active adults should also meet the ANSI Z87.1 standard, &#173;unless the patient is duly warned that he or she is not getting the most impact-&#173;resistant lenses available.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Standard glass</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Glass lenses provide superior optics and are scratch resistant but also have several limitations, including low impact re&#173;sis&#173;tance, increased thickness, and heavy weight. Once the standard in the industry, glass lenses are less frequently used in current practice; many patients select plastic lenses. Without special treatment, glass lenses may be easily shattered. Chemical or thermal <span class="italic">tempering</span> increases the shatter re&#173;sis&#173;tance of glass, but if it is scratched or worked on with any tool &#173;after tempering, the shatter re&#173;sis&#173;tance is lost. Farmers appreciate photoreactive glass for its scratch re&#173;sis&#173;tance and easy care. Welders and grinders are better off with plastic, as small hot particles can become embedded in glass. Persons with myopia who desire thin glasses may choose high-&#173;index glass. The highest-&#173;index versions cannot be tempered and require that waivers be signed by patients who accept the danger of their breakage. High-&#173;index glass does not block UV light &#173;unless a coating is applied. (Characteristics of standard glass lenses are as follows: index of refraction, 1.52; Abbe number, 59; specific gravity, 2.54; impact re&#173;sis&#173;tance, pass FDA 21CFR801.410 if thick enough and chemically or heat treated.)</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Standard plastic</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Due to its high optical quality and light weight, standard plastic (also known as hard resin or CR-39) is the most commonly used lens material and is inexpensive. Standard plastic lenses are almost 50% lighter than glass lenses owing to the lower specific gravity of their material. They block 80% of UV light without treatment, can be tinted easily if desired, and can be coated to resist scratching and to provide further UV-&#173;light blocking. The index of refraction is not high, so the lenses are not thin. CR-39 lenses do not have the shatter re&#173;sis&#173;tance of polycarbonate or Trivex. (Characteristics of standard plastic lenses are as follows: index of refraction, 1.49; Abbe number, 58; specific gravity, 1.32; impact re&#173;sis&#173;tance, pass FDA 21CFR801.410.)</p>
			<p class="h3">Polycarbonate</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Introduced in the 1970s for ophthalmic lens use, the high-&#173;index plastic material polycarbonate has a low specific gravity and a higher refractive index, which allow for a light, thin lens. Polycarbonate is also durable and meets the high-&#173;velocity impact standard (ANSI Z87.1). One disadvantage of this material is the high degree of chromatic aberration, as indicated by its low Abbe number (30). Thus, color fringing can be an annoyance, particularly in strong prescriptions. Another disadvantage is that polycarbonate is the most easily scratched plastic, so a scratch-&#173;resistant coating is required. Also, if polycarbonate is cut too thin, it can flex on impact and pop out of the frame. (Characteristics of polycarbonate lenses are as follows: index of refraction, 1.58; Abbe number, 30; specific gravity, 1.20; impact re&#173;sis&#173;tance, pass FDA 21CFR801.410 and ANSI Z87.1.)</p>
			<p class="h3">Trivex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Introduced in 2001, Trivex is a highly impact-&#173;resistant, low-&#173;density material that delivers strong optical per&#173;for&#173;mance and provides clear vision &#173;because of its high Abbe number. Its impact re&#173;sis&#173;tance is close to that of polycarbonate, and it blocks all UV light. Its index of refraction is not high, however, so the lenses are not thin. Trivex is the lightest lens material currently available and meets the high-&#173;velocity impact standard (ANSI Z87.1). Trivex material allows a comparably thin lens for the <span class="symbol">±</span>3.00 D prescription range. A scratch-&#173;resistant coating is required. (Characteristics of Trivex lenses are as follows: index of refraction, 1.53; Abbe number, 45; specific gravity, 1.11; impact re&#173;sis&#173;tance, pass FDA 21CFR801.410 and ANSI Z87.1.)</p>
			<p class="h3">High-&#173;index materials</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A lens with a refractive index of 1.60 or higher is referred to as a <span class="italic">high-&#173;index lens.</span> High-&#173;index materials can be &#173;either glass or plastic and are most often used for higher-&#173;power prescriptions to create thin, cosmetically attractive lenses. The weight, optical clarity, and impact re&#173;sis&#173;tance of high-&#173;index lenses vary depending on the specific material used and the refractive index; in general, as the index of refraction increases, the weight of the material increases and the optical clarity (Abbe number) decreases. None of the high-&#173;index materials passes the ANSI Z87.1 standard for impact re&#173;sis&#173;tance. Plastic high-&#173;index materials require a scratch-&#173;resistant coating.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-30">Therapeutic Use of Prisms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Small horizontal and vertical deviations can be corrected con&#173;ve&#173;niently in spectacle lenses by the addition of prisms.</p>
			<p class="h3">Horizontal heterophorias</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Asthenopic symptoms may develop in patients (usually adults) if fusion is disrupted by inadequate vergence amplitudes; if fusion cannot be maintained, diplopia results. Thus, in patients with an exophoria at near, symptoms develop when the convergence reserve is inadequate for the task. Some patients can compensate for this fusional inadequacy through the improvement of fusional amplitudes. Younger patients may be able to do so through orthoptic exercises, which are sometimes used in conjunction with prisms that further stimulate their fusional capability (base-&#173;out prisms to enhance convergence reserve).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Symptoms may arise in some patients &#173;because of abnormally high accommodative convergence. Thus, an esophoria at near may be improved by full hyperopic correction for distance and/or by the use of bifocal lenses to decrease accommodative demand. In adult patients, orthoptic training and maximum refractive correction may be inadequate, and prisms or surgery may be necessary to restore binocularity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prisms are especially useful if a patient experiences an abrupt onset of symptoms secondary to a basic heterophoria or heterotropia. The prisms may be needed only temporarily, and the minimum amount of prism correction necessary to reestablish and maintain binocularity should be used.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">Vertical heterophorias</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vertical fusional amplitudes are small (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>2.00<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">Δ</span>D). Thus, if a vertical muscle imbalance is sufficient to cause asthenopic symptoms or diplopia, it should be compensated for by the incorporation of prisms into the refractive correction. Once again, the minimum amount of prism needed to eliminate symptoms should be prescribed. In a noncomitant vertical heterophoria, the prism should be sufficient to correct the imbalance in primary gaze. With combined vertical and horizontal muscle imbalance, correcting only the vertical deviation may help improve control of the horizontal deviation as well. If the horizontal deviation is not adequately corrected, an oblique Fresnel prism may be helpful. A brief period of clinical heterophoria testing may be insufficient to unmask a latent muscle imbalance. Often, &#173;after prisms have been worn for a time, the phoria appears to increase, and the prism correction must be correspondingly increased.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">Methods of prism correction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The potential effect of prisms should be evaluated by having the patient test the indicated prism in trial frames or trial lens clips over the current refractive correction. Temporary prisms in the form of clip-on lenses or Fresnel press-on prisms can be used to evaluate and alter the final prism requirement. The Fresnel prisms have several advantages: (1) they are lighter in weight (1&#160;mm thick) and more acceptable cosmetically &#173;because they are affixed to the concave surface of the spectacle lens, and (2) they allow much larger prism corrections (up to 40.0<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">Δ</span>). With higher prism powers, however, it is not uncommon to observe a decrease in the visual acuity of the corrected eye. Patients may also observe chromatic fringes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prisms can be incorporated into spectacle lenses within the limits of cost, appearance, weight, and the technical skill of the optician. Prisms should be incorporated into the spectacle lens prescription only &#173;after an adequate trial of temporary prisms has established that the correction is appropriate and the deviation is stable.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prism correction may also be achieved by decentering the optical center of the lens relative to the visual axis, although a substantial prism effect by means of this method is pos&#173;si&#173;ble only with higher-&#173;power lenses. Aspheric lens designs are not suitable for decentration. (See earlier discussion of lens decentration and the Prentice rule.) Bifocal segments may be decentered <span class="italic">in</span> more than the customary amount to give a modest additional base-in effect to help patients with convergence insufficiency.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-25">Management of Anisometropia</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top14"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;4-4</span> highlights approaches to the management of anisometropia. &#173;These include full correction with adaptation, undercorrection of 1 eye to reduce anisometropia, contact lens wear (1 or both eyes), refractive surgery, reducing aniseikonia, and reducing induced vertical prismatic effect.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Troubleshooting of Dissatisfied Spectacle Wearers</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top15"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The management of dissatisfied spectacle wearers is both an art and a science. As in many areas of medicine, the management of expectations is critical. Demonstrations with trial frames and overrefracting with the patient’s existing spectacles may be helpful tools. Major changes (such as cylinder axis changes) should be carefully evaluated and discussed with the patient prior to prescribing. Many potential prob&#173;lems can be prevented with appropriate attention during the prescribing and fitting pro&#173;cess. A good working relationship with the optometrist and dispensing optician is critical. The written prescription is helpful in preventing prob&#173;lems. The interpupillary distance (monocular for PALs) should be included. Vertex distance should be specified for high prescriptions. The exact type of bifocal, trifocal, or PAL should be specified or noted if it should remain the same as in the current glasses. Any prismatic correction should be carefully noted, mentioning &#173;whether it is the same as the current glasses so that the dispensing optician can verify this. The dispensing optician has extensive latitude in the &#173;actual materials and coatings of the lens as well as the type and style of the bifocal and the vertex distance &#173;unless it is written on the prescription. For instance, if the prescriber wishes to keep the same base curve as the current spectacles (to decrease changes in image size in the case of anisometropia) this should be specified on the prescription. The lens material should be indicated, especially if it is a high-&#173;index or impact-&#173;resistant material. Any photochromic or lens tint or other coatings that the prescriber wants the spectacles to have should be specified.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A “balance lens” may be specified for a completely blind eye. This allows the dispensing optician to place a lens that is cosmetically similar to the fellow eye. In some cases, this may lessen the cost of the lens for the patient. Care must be taken in prescribing this for an eye with limited but usable vision (amblyopia, macular degeneration). Leaving the power of this lens at the discretion of the optician with only cosmetic concerns may cause functional prob&#173;lems.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once the patient pres&#173;ents with dissatisfaction with a new spectacle correction, a detailed history of the prob&#173;lem must be performed. The nature of the complaint should be isolated, if pos&#173;si&#173;ble, to its source: distance or near vision, static or dynamic, and blurring, distortion, and/or diplopia. The spectacle power and optic center should be determined and confirmed with that ordered. The refraction should be rechecked, especially in the case of a significant difference from the previous spectacle correction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the case where the previous spectacle correction is not dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from the new one, then a comparison of other properties of the spectacles is helpful. In addition to the verification of the optical centers (induced prism), prismatic correction, or slab-&#173;off in the previous correction should also be pres&#173;ent in the new prescription. Changes in base curve and center thickness (from old to new) may cause aniseikonia symptoms. If the previous prescription is very old, it should be checked with a Geneva lens clock for plus (front) cylinder design. Differences in bifocal type and position should <br />be noted. Positioning and alignment of PALs should be noted. A change in model <br />of PAL may cause significant prob&#173;lems. A change from traditional bifocals or trifocals to <br />PALs may also be a source of prob&#173;lems. Vertex distance changes and pantoscopic tilt may lead to effective lens power differences. Fi&#173;nally, lens material changes may cause chromatic aberrations.</p>

			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;4.1.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> The Jackson cross cylinder is a lens made of 2 cylinders of equal but opposite magnitude placed at 90° relative to each other; the spherical equivalent of the resulting lens is zero (see Fig&#160;4-17). High-&#173;power Jackson cross cylinders are especially useful in refining the refraction in low vision patients.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;4.2.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> Spherical aberration occurs in patients with large or dilated pupils. This aberration is caused when light rays are refracted as they travel through a widely dilated pupil and strike the peripheral crystalline lens. The periphery of the &#173;human lens is more curved than the center, so the incoming light rays show increased refraction compared with the light rays that strike the central lens. In retinoscopy, this can result in the appearance of dif&#173;fer&#173;ent central and peripheral reflexes. Thus, it is always impor&#173;tant to concentrate on the central light reflex when performing retinoscopy.</p>

However, for the old lens to focus the image on the ret&#173;ina, it must be held by the frame 12&#160;mm in front of the cornea. Thus, the far point of the patient’s hyperopia is located 99&#160;mm (111&#160;mm <span class="symbol">−</span> 12&#160;mm) &#173;behind the cornea. If the new frame is to be located 22&#160;mm in front of the cornea, it should be placed 121&#160;mm (99&#160;mm <span class="symbol">+</span> 22&#160;mm) in front of the far point of the patient’s hyperopia.

The lower the Abbe number, the higher the amount of chromatic aberration pres&#173;ent in the lens material.

			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;4.8.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> When a patient has anisometropia, which may arise &#173;after cataract surgery, for example, a large vertical prismatic effect is induced in the bifocal add. When the patient suddenly looks through the top of the bifocal segment, image jump occurs &#173;because of vertical prismatic effects through the spectacle lenses. Image jump is a prob&#173;lem &#173;because the &#173;human brain has a very limited capacity to fuse 2 images that are separated vertically, as in the case of a bifocal lens with anisometropia.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;4.9.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> As the eyes look down to read through the add segment, &#173;there is an abrupt upward image jump at the top edge of the segment. This jump is due to the prismatic effect of the plus lens (the add segment). On the basis of the Prentice rule, the amount of jump depends on the power of the segment and on the distance from the top of the segment to the optical center of the segment.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;4.10.&#9;<span class="bold">d.</span> As a general rule, the number of prism diopters is approximately twice the &#173;angle in degrees. However, this equation works only for small &#173;angles (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>20°). An &#173;angle of 45° means that at 1&#160;m, a beam is deviated by 1&#160;m (100&#160;cm). Thus, 45° corresponds to 100.0<span class="greek CharOverride-1">Δ</span>. An &#173;angle of 90° corresponds to infinity in prism diopters.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;4.11.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> In general, patients perceive image jump as a greater prob&#173;lem than image displacement. Flat-&#173;top segments minimize image jump &#173;because the optical center is near the top. In patients with myopia, flat-&#173;top segments also reduce prism displacement &#173;because the base-&#173;down effect of the distance portion is reduced by the base-up effect of the segment.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;4.12.&#9;<span class="bold">d</span>. Aphakic spectacles &#173;will generate base-in prism with convergence when compared to contact lens correction. Adjustment of the optical centers, addition of base-&#173;out prism, or single-&#173;vision reading glasses may improve this prob&#173;lem.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;4.13&#9;<span class="bold">c</span>. In the chin-up position, the patient is effectively adding plus power to the distance prescription by viewing through the upper portion of the add. The patient has &#173;either undercorrected hyperopia or overcorrected myopia.</p>
			<p class="section-3-exercises--answer-">&#9;4.14&#9;<span class="bold">d.</span> The induced prism is a result of the anisometropia of the distance correction. The bifocal add is equal, and &#173;there should be no induced prism contribution from that. If the top of the bifocal is 3&#160;mm below the optical center of the lens and the patient is looking 4&#160;mm below that, then the distance for the Prentice rule is 7&#160;mm and the power difference is 3 D; therefore, 2.1<span class="greek CharOverride-1">Δ</span> with the induced prism base in the more myopic correction (right side).</p>
