			<p class="chapter-title">Choroidal Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This chapter describes noninflammatory choroidal diseases that also involve the ret&#173;ina. Inflammatory disorders of the ret&#173;ina and choroid are discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span>. See also BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span> Intraocular tumors, such as melanoma, are covered in BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors.</span></p>
			<p class="h1">Central Serous Chorioretinopathy</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC)</span> &#173;causes an idiopathic serous detachment of the ret&#173;ina related to leakage at the level of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE), secondary to hyperpermeability of the choriocapillaris, as seen on indocyanine green angiography. The condition was originally described in 1866 by von Graefe, who called it recurrent central retinitis. In the 1940s, the condition became known, through the influence of Duke-&#173;Elder, as central serous retinopathy. Many papers published during that era found that the condition occurred most often in young men, with a male-&#173;female incidence ratio of approximately 10:1. &#173;These papers, which &#173;were published during World War II, &#173;were based predominantly on studies of military conscripts. In 1955, Bennett published reports on a series of patients with central serous retinopathy and determined that the majority had a “tense obsessional or inadequate personality” or experienced “worry or over-&#173;work.” He stated that &#173;there had been a “&#173;great awakening of interest in the effects of stress on the organism acting through the ner&#173;vous and endocrine systems,” thus highlighting the influence of psychological &#173;factors. Maumenee &#173;later performed fluorescein angioscopy on patients with CSC and found a leak at the level of the RPE, not from ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels (the previously hypothesized source of leakage). Gass described the fluorescein angiographic findings and suggested that &#173;laser photocoagulation could be used to treat affected patients. Gass also stated that the disease was secondary to hyperpermeability of the choriocapillaris, a finding which was confirmed de&#173;cades &#173;later via ICG angiography.</p>
			<p class="h2">Demographics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">CSC occurs primarily in persons between the ages of 35 and 55&#160;years, with a male-&#173;female ratio of 3:1; at pres&#173;ent &#173;there are no reliable statistics suggesting any association with race. Patients describe a variety of symptoms, including sudden onset of blurred or dim vision, micropsia, metamorphopsia, paracentral scotomas, decreased color vision, and prolonged afterimages. Visual acuity ranges from 20/20 to 20/200, but in most patients, it is better than 20/30. Decreased visual acuity can often be improved with a small hyperopic correction. CSC can show several clinical variations in its expressions. In an acute manifestation, the ret&#173;ina has a round or oval elevation in the macular region; it often involves the fovea. Fluorescein angiography shows leaks from the RPE that may appear, early in the angiographic sequence, as a dot (the “dot” form) or as a tree-&#173;shaped movement of dye in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space (the “smokestack” form) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-1</span>). In some circumstances, vigorous leaks can cause deposition of a grayish white, feathered-&#173;edge subret&#173;i&#173;nal material that is generally believed to be fibrin. In chronic CSC, the RPE shows granular pigmentation; fluorescein angiography reveals many small, sometimes inconspicuous leaks; and &#173;there is widespread shallow detachment with areas of atrophy of the photoreceptors (see Fig 9-1).</p>
			<p class="body-text">As mentioned, CSC is associated with stress and with a tense, driven personality. Systemic associations include endogenous hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome), hypertension, sleep apnea, use of psychopharmacologic medi&#173;cations, and pregnancy. Use of systemic corticosteroids is associated with CSC, but curiously, use of intraocular corticosteroids does not appear to be associated with the condition.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Imaging</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The extent of the detachment can be documented with color fundus photo&#173;graphs. Autofluorescence imaging shows the accumulation of shed outer segments in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space, as well as distributed defects of the RPE. It has been theorized that the white dots seen &#173;under the ret&#173;ina are macrophages with fluorophores from phagocytized outer segments (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-2</span>). Eyes with chronic CSC can display descending tracts during both fluorescein and autofluorescence imaging (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-3</span>). Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-&#173;OCT) shows thickening of the choroid and, in areas where thickening is most prominent, posterior loculation of fluid in the deep choroid. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;9-4</span> shows the internal structure of a healthy choroid, while <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;9-5</span> shows the choroid in 1 healthy eye and in 3 eyes with CSC. Although ICG angiography is able to visualize choroidal vascular hyperpermeability (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-6</span>), it has largely been supplanted by OCT, even for detecting pos&#173;si&#173;ble coexisting choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which may be pres&#173;ent in up to 20% of cases in individuals over the age of 50&#160;years. OCT angiography seems to be &#173;adept at detecting type 1 CNV in &#173;these patients.</p>

			<p class="h2">Differential Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As discussed, CSC appears to be caused by hyperpermeability of choroidal vessels. Other entities that may be considered in the differential diagnosis include type 1 CNV and poly&#173;poidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), which is a variant of type 1 CNV. The fluorescein angiographic findings can overlap significantly; both show leakage of fluorescein and the visualization of the structures under&#173;lying the RPE is poor. If CNV is pres&#173;ent, OCT demonstrates an irregular wavy, shallow elevation of the RPE by a layer of material with heterogeneous reflectivity. The neovascularization seen in association with CSC are generally easy to detect with OCT angiography. What complicates the issue, particularly regarding treatment, is that type 1 CNV and PCV appear to be associated with CSC; they may be its sequelae.</p>
			<p class="h2">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">CSC is destructive and therefore can cause visually significant scotomas. Secondary CNV occurs in the immediate postoperative period in up to 2% of eyes that have been treated with photocoagulation. &#173;Laser photocoagulation is not associated with a reduced rate of recurrence. Verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) reduces or eliminates subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid and is associated with few complications, the most common of which is atrophy, which occurs in about 4% of treated eyes. Recurrence &#173;after successful PDT is rare. &#173;Laser photocoagulation has no effect on choroidal thickness, while PDT decreases choroidal thickness and reduces choroidal vascular hyperpermeability. Use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as eplerenone or spironolactone is associated with resolution of subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid in about 25% of treated patients, but this therapy has not been the subject of a randomized trial.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Choroidal Perfusion Abnormalities</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The choroid has arterial supply from approximately 20 short posterior ciliary arteries and 2 anterior ciliary arteries. A network of branching arterioles distributes the blood throughout the choroid in a segmental fashion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-7</span>), ultimately leading to the choriocapillaris, and helps reduce the blood pressure as well. Although the vessels in the choriocapillaris exhibit relatively uniform patterns in any given region of the eye, the pressure gradients imposed by the feed arterioles and draining venules establish a lobular perfusion pattern. Abnormalities in choroidal blood flow can be divided into several main categories based on the under&#173;lying disease pro&#173;cess.</p>
			<p class="h2">Arteritic Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In arteritic diseases such as <span class="italic">&#173;giant cell arteritis</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-8</span>) or <span class="italic">granulomatosis with polyangiitis</span> (formerly, Wegener granulomatosis) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-9</span>), inflammatory occlusion can cause sectoral areas of nonperfusion. Fluorescein or ICG angiography is typically performed in cases in which an arteritic cause of vision loss is suspected, &#173;because flow defects in the choroid are often undetected by ophthalmoscopy alone.</p>
			<p class="h2">Nonarteritic Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nonarteritic prob&#173;lems with flow could occur due to embolic or systemic disease or as part of the manifestation of severe hypertension. Emboli from the heart, corticosteroids or calcium hydroxyapatite injection, and intravascular coagulation all have the potential to occlude choroidal vessels. Vascular occlusion could also occur in patients with lupus anticoagulants. <span class="italic">Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura</span> &#173;causes a classic pentad of findings: (1)&#160;microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, (2) thrombocytopenia, (3) fever, (4)&#160;neurologic dysfunction, and (5) renal dysfunction. Patients with this condition may have multifocal yellow placoid areas and associated serous detachment of the ret&#173;ina. Similar fundus findings may occur in patients with <span class="italic">disseminated intravascular coagulation,</span> in which consumption of coagulation proteins, involvement of cellular ele&#173;ments, and release of fibrin degradation products lead to hemorrhage from multiple sites and ischemia from microthrombi.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Similar fundus findings occur in patients with acute hypertension, such as <span class="italic">malignant hypertension</span> or <span class="italic">eclampsia</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-10</span>). In addition to ret&#173;i&#173;nal and optic nerve head abnormalities, &#173;these disorders also commonly lead to serous detachment of the ret&#173;ina associated with areas of yellow placoid discoloration of the RPE (see Fig 9-&#173;10). The perfusion abnormalities may range from focal infarction of the choriocapillaris to fibrinoid necrosis of larger arterioles. Resolution of smaller infarcts, which initially appear tan in color, produces small patches of atrophy and pigmentary hyperplasia called <span class="italic">Elschnig spots.</span> Infarction of an arteriole can lead to <span class="italic">Siegrist streaks</span>, while sector-&#173;shaped abnormalities are called <span class="italic">Amalric triangles</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Older patients may have areas of slow blood flow in the choroid, causing choroidal filling defects. The flow prob&#173;lems may result from low inflow pressure. Histologic sections of eyes of older patients may reveal intimal hyperplasia and medial hypertrophy with a decrease in the lumen size. This change may also adversely affect blood flow. Decreased flow in the segmentally arranged choroid can cause areas of particularly decreased perfusion between areas of low perfusion; &#173;these are called <span class="italic">watershed defects</span>.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Choriocapillaris Blood Flow Abnormalities</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Choroidal blood flow defects affect lobule-&#173;sized areas of the choroid or areas supplied by arterioles and therefore affect one to several choroidal lobules. Many ocular diseases (eg, acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy) characteristically produce lesions that are the putative size of a choroidal lobule. The advent of OCT angiography has uncovered another prob&#173;lem in choroidal circulation. The choriocapillaris develops multiple areas of signal voids, consistent with decreased perfusion. &#173;These areas increase in size and number with age; they are also larger and more numerous in patients with hypertension, pseudodrusen, or, interestingly, late age-&#173;related macular degeneration in the <span class="italic">fellow</span> eye. In addition, &#173;these defects exhibit power law probability distributions, which may be useful in gauging ocular and systemic health. &#173;These characteristic OCT angiographic findings are consistent with histologic studies showing an increasing number of ghost vessels in the choriocapillaris (a sign of vessel death), basal linear deposits, and subret&#173;i&#173;nal drusenoid deposits with increasing age. Hayreh characterized the segmental nature of blood flow in the choroid from larger to smaller vessels and fi&#173;nally to the choriocapillaris lobule. The data from OCT angiography descends another unit of scale to show potential defects in capillary flow within parts of a choroidal lobule. Some diseases are known to be associated with RPE atrophy in addition to geographic atrophy; they include pseudoxanthoma elasticum and maternally inherited diabetes mellitus and deafness. Even in the absence of the development of RPE atrophy, &#173;these patients can exhibit remarkable loss of the choriocapillaris (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-11</span>). Curiously, pseudodrusen also develop in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Increased Venous Pressure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although rare, choroidal blood flow abnormalities may be related to venous outflow prob&#173;lems, including &#173;those caused by <span class="italic">dural arteriovenous malformations</span> or <span class="italic">carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-12</span>)<span class="italic">.</span> Diagnosis of choroidal blood flow abnormalities often requires dye-&#173;based angiography, and occasionally a stethoscope (to detect a bruit). &#173;These patients should be referred for appropriate medical evaluation.</p>

			<p class="h1">Age-Related Choroidal Atrophy</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The thickness of the choroid decreases with higher amounts of myopia and increasing age. The eyes of some older patients have choroids that are much thinner than expected. &#173;These same eyes tend to have <span class="italic">pseudodrusen</span>, which resemble drusen in appearance but are caused by collections of subret&#173;i&#173;nal drusenoid deposits above the RPE. Like eyes with drusen, eyes with subret&#173;i&#173;nal drusenoid deposits have an increased risk for CNV, particularly types 2 and 3, <br />and geographic atrophy. More than 90% of eyes with geographic atrophy also have pseudodrusen. Unlike eyes with drusen, eyes with subret&#173;i&#173;nal drusenoid deposits exhibit poorer micro&#173;perimetry per&#173;for&#173;mance and markedly prolonged dark adaptation (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 9-13, 9-1</span><span class="xref-figure">4</span>).</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Choroidal Folds</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Folds in the choroid, sometimes called <span class="italic">chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal folds</span>, occur secondary to several diseases. Forces external to the eye, such as an indenting tumor or thyroid eye disease, can cause folds in the choroid. The sclera may be thickened by posterior scleritis, thereby crowding the choroid. A relatively common cause, one that is also poorly characterized, is the development of choroidal folds in middle-&#173;aged adults, some of whom acquire an increased amount of hyperopia. One theory is &#173;these patients, who develop bilaterally symmetric horizontal or oblique choroidal folds, may have an inflammatory disease that &#173;causes scleral shortening and flattening of the posterior sclera. Engorgement of the choroid &#173;causes an expansion of the tissue, which is limited by the sclera. The engorgement can be the result of inflammation and a diffusely infiltrative condition such as lymphoma. Reduced intraocular pressure can cause ciliochoroidal effusions and curvilinear choroidal folds in the posterior pole, a condition known as <span class="italic">hypotony maculopathy</span>. Medi&#173;cations such as topiramate can cause idiopathic swelling of the choroid with creation of chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal folds and ciliochoroidal effusions without hypotony. Increased intracranial pressure can cause fine folds that course circumferentially around the optic nerve head; &#173;these folds are called <span class="italic">Patton lines</span>. Localized choroidal folds can be seen in association with CNV, choroidal neoplasms, and scleral buckles (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-15</span>).</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Choroidal Hemangiomas</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Isolated <span class="italic">choroidal hemangiomas</span> are reddish-orange, well-&#173;circumscribed tumors of varying thickness that can affect the macula &#173;either directly or through subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-16</span>). Circumscribed hemangiomas transilluminate readily and exhibit highly echographic patterns on ultrasonography. During dye-&#173;based angiography, hemangiomas show very early filling of large vessels. <span class="italic">Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome</span> (encephalofacial cavernous hemangiomatosis) &#173;causes a diffuse hemangioma that may pres&#173;ent first as glaucoma or amblyopia in &#173;children. The areas corresponding to the hemangioma have a typical tomato ketchup appearance, and the under&#173;lying choroidal markings are not vis&#173;i&#173;ble. The choroidal hemangiomas in Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome are sometimes overlooked &#173;because they are diffuse and may blend imperceptibly into adjacent normal choroid. An ipsilateral facial nevus flammeus (port-&#173;wine stain) is also typically pres&#173;ent in patients with this syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The alterations caused by choroidal hemangiomas include cystic ret&#173;i&#173;nal edema, hard exudate, neurosensory detachment, and calcification and ossification in the choroid. Hemangiomas have been treated with &#173;laser photocoagulation, cryopexy, external-&#173;beam and plaque radiation, and PDT. The success rate for treatment of diffuse hemangiomas with visual acuity improvement is poor. PDT with verteporfin may have the lowest risk of treatment-&#173;related morbidity.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Uveal Effusion Syndrome</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In <span class="italic">uveal effusion syndrome</span>, abnormal scleral composition or thickness reduces transscleral aqueous outflow, inhibiting net fluid movement through the posterior eye wall. Choroidal and ciliary body thickening, RPE alterations, and exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment may occur. The choroid is often so thick that OCT imaging is not pos&#173;si&#173;ble, but the gross thickening can be imaged with ultrasonography. Fluorescein angiography usually shows a leopard-&#173;spot pattern of hypofluorescence without focal leakage (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">17</span>). Visual function may fluctuate. Although scleral win&#173;dow surgery may yield anatomical restitution, the visual results may be less satisfactory &#173;because of chronic, irreversible changes caused by the condition. A high index of suspicion for uveal effusion syndrome should be maintained for young patients with hyperopia whose disorder has been diagnosed as &#173;either CSC or ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment without a ret&#173;i&#173;nal hole or tear.

The bilateral proliferation of benign melanocytes is usually associated with or often heralds systemic cancer. &#173;These proliferations can look like large nevi. Most patients with BDUMP also exhibit nummular loss of the RPE, an anatomical change that differs distinctly from large nevi or thickening of the choroid. &#173;These areas of RPE loss are hypoautofluorescent during autofluorescence imaging, but hyperfluorescent during fluorescein angiography. OCT shows mounds of residual material, presumed to be per&#173;sis&#173;tent RPE cells between areas of loss.

The region of shaggy photoreceptors contains punctate dots that are highly reflective; it has been theorized that these dots are macrophages. <span class="figure-source-note">(Courtesy of Richard F.
