			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sickle cell anemia is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States. The sickle cell hemoglobinopathies of greatest ocular importance are &#173;those in which mutant hemoglobins S, C, or both are inherited instead of normal hemoglobin A (see BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology</span>). Sickle cell hemoglobinopathies are most prevalent in the black population, and affect about 10% of African Americans (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;7-&#173;1</span>). Thalassemia, in which the <span class="greek">α</span>-&#173; or <span class="greek">β</span>-&#173;polypeptide chain is defective, is rare but frequently &#173;causes retinopathy. Although sickling and solubility tests (sickle cell preparations) are reliable indicators of the presence of hemoglobin S and are therefore excellent for sickle cell anemia screening, &#173;these tests do not distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous states in the hemoglobinopathies. Patients who test positive on sickle cell preparations should also undergo hemoglobin electrophoresis testing.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Nonproliferative Sickle Cell Retinopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ret&#173;i&#173;nal changes in nonproliferative sickle cell retinopathy (NPSR) are caused by arteriolar and capillary occlusion. Anastomosis and remodeling occur in the periphery, as does the resorption of blood around the infarct. Salmon-&#173;patch hemorrhages represent areas of intraret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage that occur &#173;after a peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal arteriolar occlusion. Refractile spots are old, resorbed hemorrhages with hemosiderin deposition within the inner ret&#173;ina just beneath the internal limiting membrane (ILM) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-&#173;1</span>). Black “sunburst” lesions are localized areas of ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelial hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and pigment migration in the peripheral ret&#173;ina, prob&#173;ably caused by hemorrhage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Occlusion of parafoveal capillaries and arterioles is one cause of decreased visual acuity in patients with sickle cell retinopathy. &#173;These changes can be detected on angiography, particularly with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and may be subtle (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-2</span>) or catastrophic (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-3</span>). Spontaneous occlusion of the central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery may also develop in patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies.</p>
			<p class="h2">Proliferative Sickle Cell Retinopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy (PSR) occurs most commonly with sickle cell hemoglobin C (SC), at a rate of approximately 33%. It occurs less commonly with sickle cell thalassemia (SThal), at a rate of approximately 14%. Sickle cell homozygote (SS) disease results in more systemic complications but has a very low incidence of proliferative retino&#173;pathy, approximately 3%. Proliferative retinopathy is rare with sickle cell trait (AS). The ocular complications result from ischemia secondary to infarction of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal tissue by means of arteriolar, precapillary arteriolar, capillary, or venular occlusions; they include ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization, preret&#173;i&#173;nal or vitreous hemorrhage, and tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">PSR has been classified into 5 stages based on the following pathoge&#173;ne&#173;tic sequence:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-4">1.&#9;Peripheral arteriolar occlusions (stage 1) lead to peripheral nonperfusion and</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;peripheral arteriovenular anastomoses (stage 2), which are dilated, preexisting capillary channels.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;Preret&#173;i&#173;nal sea fan neovascularization (stage 3) may occur at the posterior border of areas of nonperfusion and lead to</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">4.&#9;vitreous hemorrhage (stage 4) and</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">5.&#9;tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment (stage 5).</p>
			<p class="body-text">PSR is one of many ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular diseases in which extraret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrovascular proliferation occurs in response to ret&#173;i&#173;nal ischemia. Whereas the neovascularization in eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) generally begins postequatorially, the neovascularization in PSR is located more peripherally (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-&#173;4</span>). Another way in which PSR can be differentiated from PDR is that in PSR, spontaneous regression of the peripheral neovascularization by autoinfarction frequently occurs, resulting in a white sea fan neovascularization (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-5</span>). <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;7-&#173;2</span> pres&#173;ents a differential diagnosis of peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization.</p>

			<p class="h2">Other Ocular Abnormalities in Sickle Cell Hemoglobinopathies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many patients with SS or SC disease exhibit segmentation of blood in the conjunctival blood vessels. Numerous comma-&#173;shaped thrombi dilate and occlude capillaries, most often in the inferior bulbar conjunctiva and fornix (referred to as the comma sign). Similarly, small vessels on the surface of the optic nerve head can exhibit intravascular occlusions, manifested as dark red spots (called the nerve head sign of sickling). Angioid streaks have been reported clinically in up to 6% of cases of SS disease and in persons with sickle cell trait (Hb AS). The pathoge&#173;ne&#173;tic basis of this association is uncertain.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Management of Sickle Cell Retinopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All black patients presenting with a traumatic hyphema should be screened for a sickling hemoglobinopathy (including Hb AS trait) &#173;because of the increased risk of complications in the presence of rigid sickled erythrocytes. Control of intraocular pressure (IOP) may be difficult, and ischemic optic neuropathy may result from even short intervals of a modest increase in IOP. Early anterior chamber washout in the presence of a hyphema with increased IOP is recommended. In addition, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors should be used cautiously in sickle cell patients as they may worsen sickling through the production of systemic acidosis.</p>

			<p class="h3">Photocoagulation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Peripheral scatter photocoagulation applied to the ischemic peripheral ret&#173;ina generally &#173;causes regression of neovascular fronds and thus decreases the risk of vitreous hemorrhage. The decision to treat PSR with scatter photocoagulation should be made cautiously, however, &#173;because ret&#173;i&#173;nal tears and subsequent rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment can occur and do so more commonly &#173;after such treatment in PSR than in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.</p>
			<p class="h3">Vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Surgery may be indicated for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage and for rhegmatogenous, tractional, schisis, or combined ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment usually begins in the ischemic peripheral ret&#173;ina. The tears typically occur at the base of sea fans and are often precipitated by photocoagulation treatment, as previously mentioned. Anterior segment ischemia or necrosis has been reported in association with 360° scleral buckling procedures, particularly when combined with extensive diathermy or cryopexy. During surgery, care should be taken to ensure adequate patient hydration and supplemental nasal oxygenation. Precautions for vitrectomy also include the judicious use of expansile gases to minimize IOP elevations postoperatively, which increase the risk of vascular occlusions. Exchange transfusion before vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal surgery is not recommended.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Vasculitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis from any cause may pro&#173;gress through the stages of inflammation, ischemia, neovascularization, and subsequent hemorrhagic and tractional complications. The early clinical manifestations are generally nonspecific, consisting of perivascular infiltrates and sheathing of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels (vascular wall thickening with vessel involution; <span class="xref-figure">Fig 7</span><span class="xref-figure">-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">6</span>). Involvement of exclusively ret&#173;i&#173;nal arteries or veins is uncommon. Veins tend to become inflamed earlier and more frequently than arterioles, and combinations are the rule.

			<p class="body-text">A primary occlusive ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculopathy for which no cause can be found is termed <span class="italic">Eales disease.</span> This condition is an occlusive vasculopathy that usually involves the peripheral ret&#173;ina of both eyes and often results in extraret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization with vitreous hemorrhage. It typically occurs in males, and &#173;there may be associated tuberculin hypersensitivity.</p>

			<p class="body-text">Chronic embolism or thrombosis without inflammation may result in a clinical picture that is indistinguishable from past ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis.

Systemic investigations are generally noncontributory, and oral prednisone has demonstrated &#173;little benefit. Capillary nonperfusion is often sufficiently severe to warrant panret&#173;i&#173;nal photocoagulation (PRP).</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Cystoid Macular Edema</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cystoid macular edema (CME) is characterized by intraret&#173;i&#173;nal edema contained in honeycomb-&#173;like cystoid spaces. The source of the edema is abnormal perifoveal ret&#173;i&#173;nal capillary permeability, which is vis&#173;i&#173;ble on fluorescein angiography as multiple small focal leaks and late pooling of the dye in extracellular cystoid spaces. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings in CME include diffuse ret&#173;i&#173;nal thickening with cystic areas of low reflectivity (reduced reflectivity), more prominently in the inner nuclear and outer plexiform layers. The OCT findings correlate with histologic studies that indicate swelling in and between m<span class="accent">ü</span>llerian glia. On occasion, a nonreflective cavity that is consistent with subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid accumulation is pres&#173;ent beneath the neurosensory ret&#173;ina (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Chapter&#160;5, </span><span class="xref-figure">Fig 5-&#173;11B</span><span class="xref-figure-local">,</span> and <span class="xref-figure-local">Chapter&#160;6, </span><span class="xref-figure">Fig 6-&#173;13A</span>). &#173;Because of the radial foveal arrangement of both the glia and Henle inner fibers, this pooling classically forms a “flower-&#173;petal” (petaloid) pattern (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7</span><span class="xref-figure">-</span><span class="xref-figure">7</span>). Severe cases may be associated with vitritis (vitreous cells) and optic nerve head swelling.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Etiologies of CME</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Abnormal permeability of the perifoveal ret&#173;i&#173;nal capillaries may occur in a wide variety of conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, central ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion (CRVO), branch ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion (BRVO), any type of uveitis (particularly pars planitis), and retinitis pigmentosa. In addition, CME may occur &#173;after any ocular surgery, such as cataract extraction (in which case the CME is termed <span class="italic">Irvine-&#173;Gass Syndrome</span>), ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment surgery, vitrectomy, glaucoma procedures, photocoagulation, and cryopexy. It can also be triggered or worsened by drugs, for example the prostaglandin analogues used to treat glaucoma or anticancer drugs such as interferon.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Subret&#173;i&#173;nal disease pro&#173;cesses (eg, choroidal neovascularization, choroidal hemangioma, or subclinical ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment) must also be considered when CME is detected; see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4 of this volume</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of CME in which fluorescein angiography fails to show leakage includes conditions such as X-&#173;linked hereditary retinoschisis, Goldmann-&#173;Favre disease, and retinitis pigmentosa, in addition to the effects of treatment by nicotinic acid, MEK inhibitors, and taxanes (see also Chapter&#160;15&#160;in this volume).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Incidence of CME</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataract surgery is one of the most common &#173;causes of CME. &#173;There is a lack of uniform definition of and diagnostic criteria for pseudophakic CME; its reported incidence ranges from approximately 1% to over 30% following extracapsular cataract extraction. The incidence of clinically relevant pseudophakic CME, which is usually defined as reduced vision in the presence of petaloid CME on fluorescein angiography, is 1%–2% in the absence of additional risk &#173;factors. Thus, most cases of pseudophakic CME are mild and asymptomatic; in other words, OCT or fluorescein angiography demonstrates CME, but the patient’s visual acuity is unaffected. The peak incidence occurs 6–10 weeks postoperatively, with spontaneous resolution occurring clinically in approximately 95% of uncomplicated cases, usually within 6 months. More severe CME may result in permanent vision loss. Many &#173;factors affect the incidence of CME. The presence of predisposing disease, as mentioned in the section Etiologies of CME, is an impor&#173;tant &#173;factor. &#173;Factors affecting the incidence and severity of CME &#173;after intraocular surgery, particularly cataract surgery, include the degree of postoperative inflammation and the presence or absence of surgical complications such as vitreous loss or iris prolapse. For further discussion of CME, see BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract.</span></p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Treatment of CME</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Therapy’s effect on CME is difficult to evaluate &#173;because of the high rate of spontaneous resolution. Pharmacologic therapy using a combination of topical corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has become commonplace for prophylaxis and is supported by the medical lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture for established edema. If CME is severe or refractory to topical therapy, periocular (eg, posterior sub-&#173;Tenon triamcinolone acetonide) or intraocular injection of ste&#173;roid preparations are appropriate escalations of therapy. Systemic acetazolamide treatment may be successful for treatment of CME, especially in chronic cases such as associated with retinitis pigmentosa. For information about treating CME associated with diabetic retinopathy or ocular venous occlusive disease, see <span class="xref-local">Chapters&#160;5 and 6 of this volume</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If CME is associated with vitreous adhesions to the iris or a corneoscleral wound, vitrectomy or Nd:YAG &#173;laser treatment to interrupt the vitreous strands may be helpful. In cases of CME caused by epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membranes or vitreomacular traction, surgical intervention may be appropriate (see Chapter&#160;20 of this volume).</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-11">Coats Disease</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Coats disease is characterized by the presence of vascular dilatations (ret&#173;i&#173;nal telangiectasia), including ectatic arterioles, microaneurysms, venous dilations (phlebectasias), and fusiform capillary dilatations, which are frequently associated with exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Usually only 1 eye is involved, and &#173;there is a marked male predominance (85%). To date, researchers have not identified an associated gene or chromosome or any hereditary pattern, and no association between Coats disease and systemic disease has been found.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In an eye with Coats disease, the abnormal vessels are compromised, resulting in the leakage of serum and other blood components, which accumulate in and &#173;under the ret&#173;ina. Any portion of the peripheral and macular capillary system may be involved. Although angiography demonstrates the presence of ret&#173;i&#173;nal capillary nonperfusion, posterior segment neovascularization is unusual. The clinical findings vary widely, ranging from mild ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular abnormalities and minimal exudation to extensive areas of ret&#173;i&#173;nal telangiectasia associated with massive leakage and exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. The severity and rate of progression appear greater in &#173;children &#173;under the age of 4&#160;years, in whom massive exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment with the ret&#173;ina apposed to the lens may simulate retinoblastoma or other &#173;causes of leukocoria (called Coats reaction; <span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">8</span>; also see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> for the differential diagnosis of leukocoria) or xanthocoria (yellow pupil).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with peripheral areas of leaky vascular anomalies typically pres&#173;ent with lipid deposition in an other&#173;wise angiographically normal macula, &#173;because “hard” exudate tends to accumulate in the macula. Similar findings in adults prob&#173;ably represent late decompensation of preexisting vascular anomalies. Occasionally, the initial finding is a submacular lipogranuloma or subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis. The differential diagnosis for Coats disease may include</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For milder cases of lipid exudation, additional considerations are diabetic retinopathy, BRVO, juxtafoveal ret&#173;i&#173;nal telangiectasia, and radiation retinopathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of Coats disease generally consists of ablation with photocoagulation or&#160;cryotherapy, and, in severe cases, ret&#173;i&#173;nal reattachment surgery. Photocoagulation and cryotherapy are effective in obliterating the vascular anomalies and in halting progression. Several treatments may be necessary, and long-&#173;term follow-up is impor&#173;tant to detect and treat recurrences or disease progression. Intravitreal anti–&#173;vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF) therapy may be a useful adjunctive treatment that is resistant to ablative therapy alone.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Macular telangiectasia type 1 (MacTel 1), also termed <span class="italic">aneurysmal telangiectasia</span>, typically occurs unilaterally, predominantly in young males, and with characteristic aneurysmal dilatations of the temporal macular vasculature with surrounding CME and yellowish exudates. MacTel 1 is considered a a macular variant of Coats disease. Peripheral vascular changes may also occur. Anti-&#173;VEGF therapy is generally in&#173;effec&#173;tive.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel 2, also called <span class="italic">juxtafoveal telangiectasis</span>), which is the most common form of macular telangiectasis, is a rare progressive bilateral idiopathic neurodegenerative disease of the macular, perifoveal, ret&#173;ina. Characteristic findings begin to appear in affected individuals in the fifth to seventh de&#173;cades of life; they include a reduced foveolar reflex, greying appearance and loss of ret&#173;i&#173;nal transparency, superficial ret&#173;i&#173;nal crystalline deposits, mildly ectatic capillaries, slightly dilated blunted venules, progression to pigment hyperplasia, and foveal atrophy. Subret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization occurs frequently during the natu&#173;ral disease course. Many of the clinical features of MacTel 2 are characterized by dysfunction of both neural and vascular ret&#173;i&#173;nal ele&#173;ments, suggesting that a macular M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cell defect plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of this disease.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conventionally, many of the syndromes referred to as phakomatoses (“&#173;mother spot”) are grouped loosely by the common features of ocular and extraocular or systemic involvement of a congenital nature. Most, but not all, are hereditary. Except for Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome, the phakomatoses involve the neuroret&#173;ina and its circulation. For further discussion of the phakomatoses, see BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> and Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Von Hippel–&#173;Lindau Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The phakomatosis <span class="italic">von Hippel–&#173;Lindau</span> <span class="italic">(VHL)</span> <span class="italic">syndrome</span> (also called <span class="italic">familial cerebello ret&#173;i&#173;nal angiomatosis</span>) is caused by a tumor suppressor gene mutation on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p26–&#173;p25), the inheritance of which is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance and variable expression. The disease is characterized by ret&#173;i&#173;nal and central ner&#173;vous system hemangioblastomas and visceral manifestations (see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>); the diagnosis can be confirmed with ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing. Central ner&#173;vous system tumors include hemangioblastomas of the cerebellum, medulla, pons, and spinal cord in 20% of patients with VHL syndrome. Systemic manifestations include renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, cysts of the kidney, pancreas, and liver, and bilateral papillary cystadenomas of the epididymis (men) or broad ligament of the uterus (&#173;women). Diagnosis of a ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemangioblastoma warrants a systemic workup and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing. Cerebellar hemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma are the leading &#173;causes of death in patients with VHL syndrome. Patients may incur severe disability from central ner&#173;vous system lesions and their treatments.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A fully developed ret&#173;i&#173;nal lesion is a spherical orange-&#173;red tumor fed by a dilated, tortuous ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery and drained by an engorged vein (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7</span><span class="xref-figure">-12</span>). Hemangioblastomas of the optic nerve head and peripapillary region are often flat and difficult to recognize. Multiple hemangioblastomas may be pres&#173;ent in the same eye, and bilateral involvement occurs in 50% of patients. Leakage from a hemangioblastoma may cause decreased vision from macular exudates (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-13</span>) with or without exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Vitreous hemorrhage or tractional detachment may also occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular management includes destructive treatment of all identified ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemangioblastoma with careful follow-up to detect recurrence or the development of new lesions. Successful treatment is facilitated by early diagnosis, &#173;because the lesions usually enlarge with time. Wide-&#173;angle fluorescein angiography can assist in detecting small, early lesions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-14</span>). Photocoagulation and cryotherapy are used to treat and destroy the angiomatous lesions directly. Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin can also be used, but the treatment effect has a limited duration &#173;because the treatment does not destroy the lesions. Successful treatment results in shrinkage of the hemangioblastoma, attenuation of the afferent vessels, and resorption of the subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid. Cryotherapy may be used to treat larger lesions, but it can cause a temporary and marked increase in the amount of exudation and sometimes exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Anti-&#173;VEGF therapy does not usually result in a meaningful, long-&#173;term treatment effect.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemangioblastomas may also occur sporadically without systemic involvement; &#173;these are termed <span class="italic">von Hippel lesions.</span> Another form of ret&#173;i&#173;nal angiomas, <span class="italic">acquired vasoproliferative lesions,</span> are idiopathic or, in rare cases, may be pres&#173;ent as a late complication of ROP, retinitis pigmentosa, or other conditions. &#173;These lesions do not have the dilated feeder and draining vessels seen with hemangioblastomas.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Wyburn-&#173;Mason Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In Wyburn-&#173;Mason syndrome, congenital ret&#173;i&#173;nal arteriovenous malformations occur in conjunction with similar ipsilateral vascular malformations in the brain, face, orbit, and mandible. The lesions are composed of blood vessels without an intervening capillary bed (racemose hemangioma). The abnormalities may range from a single arteriovenous communication to a complex anastomotic system. In the eye, the lesions are usually asymptomatic, unilateral, and located in the ret&#173;ina and optic nerve. Typically, they do not show leakage on fluorescein angiography. Intraosseous vascular malformations that may occur in the maxilla and mandible can lead to unexpected hemorrhaging during dental extractions. Most commonly, racemose hemangiomas in the ret&#173;ina are isolated and are not part of the full syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Cavernous Hemangioma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although most cases of cavernous hemangioma are sporadic and restricted to the ret&#173;ina or optic nerve head, they may occur in a familial (autosomal-&#173;dominant) pattern and may be associated with intracranial and skin hemangiomas. For this reason, cavernous hemangioma may be considered one of the phakomatoses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal cavernous hemangioma is characterized by the formation of grapelike clusters of thin-&#173;walled saccular angiomatous lesions in the inner ret&#173;ina or on the optic nerve head (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-15</span>). The blood flow in &#173;these lesions is derived from the ret&#173;i&#173;nal circulation and is relatively stagnant, producing a characteristic picture on fluorescein angiography. &#173;These dilated saccular lesions fill slowly during angiography, the sluggish blood flow results in plasma-&#173;erythrocyte layering. Fluorescein leakage is characteristically absent, correlating with the absence of subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid and exudate in the ret&#173;i&#173;nal cavernous hemangioma and serving to differentiate the condition from ret&#173;i&#173;nal telangiectasia, ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemangioblastomas, and racemose hemangioma of the ret&#173;i&#173;na.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;These hemangiomas usually remain asymptomatic but may bleed into the vitreous in rare instances. Vitreous traction is thought to be the cause of the hemorrhage in &#173;these cases. Treatment of ret&#173;i&#173;nal cavernous hemangiomas is usually not indicated &#173;unless vitreous hemorrhage recurs, in which case photocoagulation or cryotherapy may be effective. For further discussion, see BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors.</span></p>

			<p class="h1">Radiation Retinopathy</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Exposure to ionizing radiation can damage the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculature. Radiation retinopathy typically has a delayed onset, is slowly progressive, and &#173;causes microangiopathic changes that clinically resemble diabetic retinopathy. Radiation retinopathy depends on dose fractionation and can occur &#173;after &#173;either external-&#173;beam or local plaque therapy, typically within months to years &#173;after radiation treatment. In general, radiation retinopathy is observed around 18 months &#173;after treatment with external-&#173;beam radiation and earlier with brachytherapy. &#173;Because radiation retinopathy appears very similar to other vascular diseases, eliciting a history of radiation treatment is impor&#173;tant in establishing the diagnosis. An exposure to doses of 30–35 grays (Gy) or more is usually required to induce clinical symptoms; occasionally, however, retinopathy may develop &#173;after as &#173;little as 15&#160;Gy of external-&#173;beam radiation. Studies have shown ret&#173;i&#173;nal damage in 50% of patients receiving 60&#160;Gy and in 85%–95% of patients receiving 70–80&#160;Gy. The total dose, volume of ret&#173;ina irradiated, and fractionation scheme are impor&#173;tant in determining the threshold dose for radiation retinopathy. See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for further discussion of &#173;these therapies, including sample dosages.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinically, affected patients may be asymptomatic or may describe decreased visual acuity. Ophthalmic examination may reveal signs of ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular disease, including cotton-&#173;wool spots, ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages, microaneurysms, perivascular sheathing, capillary telangiectasis, macular edema, and optic nerve head edema. Capillary nonperfusion, documented by fluorescein angiography, is commonly pres&#173;ent, and extensive ret&#173;i&#173;nal is&#173;chemia can lead to neovascularization of the ret&#173;ina, iris, or optic nerve head (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">16</span>). Other pos&#173;si&#173;ble complications include optic atrophy, central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion, CRVO, choroidal neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, neovascular glaucoma, and tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Vision outcome is primarily related to the extent of the macular involvement with CME, exudative maculopathy, or capillary nonperfusion. Occasionally, vision loss may be caused by acute optic neuropathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anti-&#173;VEGF may be an effective treatment for radiation retinopathy. &#173;Laser photocoagulation is less effective &#173;because it creates ret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy and &#173;laser scar pigment creep.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-17">Valsalva Retinopathy</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A sudden rise in intrathoracic or intra-&#173;abdominal pressure (eg, as during coughing, vomiting, lifting, or straining for a bowel movement) may increase intraocular venous pressure sufficiently to rupture small superficial capillaries in the macula. The hemorrhage is typically located &#173;under the ILM, where it may create a hemorrhagic detachment of the&#160;ILM. Vitreous hemorrhage and subret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage may be pres&#173;ent. Vision is usually only mildly reduced and the prognosis is excellent, with spontaneous resolution usually occurring within months &#173;after onset. The differential diagnosis of Valsalva retinopathy includes posterior vitreous separation, which may cause an identical hemorrhage or a macroaneurysm. Therefore, in all cases, a peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal tear or an aneurysm along an arteriole must be ruled out.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-17">Purtscher Retinopathy and Purtscherlike Retinopathy</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top9">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;After acute compression injuries to the thorax or head, a patient may experience loss of vision associated with Purtscher retinopathy in 1 or both eyes. Cotton-&#173;wool spots, polygonal &#173;shaped areas of ret&#173;i&#173;nal whitening (Purtscher flecken), hemorrhages, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal edema are found most commonly surrounding the optic nerve head, and fluorescein angiography reveals evidence of arteriolar obstruction and leakage. Occasionally, patients pres&#173;ent with optic nerve head edema and an afferent pupillary defect. Vision may be permanently lost from infarction, and optic atrophy may develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Purtscher retinopathy is thought to be a result of injury-&#173;induced complement activation, which &#173;causes granulocyte aggregation and leukoembolization. This pro&#173;cess in turn can occlude small arterioles. When the occlusion of a precapillary arteriole affects the radial peripapillary capillary network, cotton-&#173;wool spots develop, which are foci of axoplasmic stasis in the nerve fiber layer; &#173;these areas of ret&#173;i&#173;nal whitening have indistinct borders and can obscure or partially overlie ret&#173;i&#173;nal blood vessels. When capillaries in lamina deeper than the radial peripapillary network are blocked, the funduscopic correlate is instead Purtscher flecken, which manifest as intraret&#173;i&#173;nal whitening with a clear zone on &#173;either side of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal arterioles, venules, and precapillary arterioles.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Even in the absence of trauma, vari&#173;ous other conditions may activate complement and produce a similar fundus appearance. &#173;Because Purtscher’s original description involved trauma, cases with similar fundus findings are termed <span class="italic">Purtscherlike retinopathy</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-17</span>; <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;7-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-table">3</span>). For example, the retinopathy associated with acute pancreatitis, which appears identical to traumatic Purtscher retinopathy, is prob&#173;ably also caused by complement-&#173;mediated leukoembolization. Other conditions that may cause &#173;these changes include collagen-&#173;vascular diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), childbirth, and amniotic fluid embolism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fat embolism following crushing injuries or long-&#173;bone fractures may cause similar ret&#173;i&#173;nal findings. Intraret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages are usually scattered in the paramacular area, and the cotton-&#173;wool spots of fat embolism are generally smaller and situated more peripherally in the ret&#173;ina than they are in Purtscher retinopathy.</p>

			<p class="h1">Terson Syndrome</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top10">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Terson syndrome is recognized as a vitreous and sub-&#173;ILM or subhyaloid hemorrhage caused by an abrupt intracranial hemorrhage. Although the exact mechanism is not known, it is suspected that the acute intracranial hemorrhage &#173;causes an acute rise in the intraocular venous pressure, resulting in a rupture of peripapillary and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels. Approximately one-&#173;third of patients with subarachnoid or subdural hemorrhage have associated intraocular hemorrhage, which may include intraret&#173;i&#173;nal and subret&#173;i&#173;nal bleeding. Terson syndrome occurs primarily in individuals between 30 and 50&#160;years old, but it can occur at any age. In most cases, visual function is unaffected once the hemorrhage clears. Spontaneous improvement generally occurs, although vitrectomy is occasionally required to clear the ocular media.</p>
