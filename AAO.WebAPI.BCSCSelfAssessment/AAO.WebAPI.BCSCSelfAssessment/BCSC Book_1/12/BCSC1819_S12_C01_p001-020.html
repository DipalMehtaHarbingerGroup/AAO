			<p class="chapter-title">Introduction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ret&#173;ina is the delicate neuroepithelium that lines the posterior segment of the eye, adhering firmly to the optic nerve head posteriorly and to the ora serrata anteriorly. Divided into central and extra-&#173;areal periphery, this layer of modified sensory cilia serves impor&#173;tant aspects of visual function, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">detail discrimination</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">color perception</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">vision in dim illumination</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">peripheral vision</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vitreous, which is the transparent structure that fills the posterior segment eye cavity, plays an impor&#173;tant role in many diseases of the posterior segment. Understanding its structure and the changes it may undergo as a result of aging is key to understanding many vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal disorders.</p>
			<p class="body-text">BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="I">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous,</span> is arranged into 3 parts. Part I, Fundamentals and Diagnostic Approaches, covers ret&#173;i&#173;nal anatomy, imaging, and functional evaluation in 3 chapters. Chapter&#160;1 provides an overview of the anatomy of the posterior segment. Chapter&#160;2 discusses examination techniques, including dilated slit-&#173;lamp biomicroscopy in combination with precorneal non–&#173;contact or contact lenses, as well as indirect ophthalmoscopy, which is often aided by scleral indentation to facilitate viewing the anterior ret&#173;i&#173;na.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Documenting clinical findings, &#173;either by description or by illustration, remains an essential ele&#173;ment of a complete posterior segment examination. In addition, ancillary testing, such as fundus photography, autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscopy, microperimetry, and electrophysiology, may provide additional diagnostic information or help detect changes over time. The vari&#173;ous incarnations of OCT (time-&#173;domain, spectral-&#173;domain, and swept-&#173;source) deserve special mention; OCT has become perhaps the most commonly ordered ancillary ophthalmic test and is revolutionizing our understanding of many vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal conditions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chapter&#160;3 reviews electrophysiologic tests and their significance in diagnosis and follow-up of ret&#173;i&#173;nal disease. Ultrasonography, or echography, employing both A-&#173; and B-scan techniques, is useful for examining patients with opaque media, can aid in the diagnosis of ret&#173;i&#173;nal or choroidal lesions, and can be used to monitor a lesion’s size.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Depending on their location, developmental or acquired alterations in the posterior segment may or may not be symptomatic. Many vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy or age-&#173;related macular degeneration, may be asymptomatic &#173;until the disease progresses to a more advanced stage. Vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal disease symptoms, when they occur, may include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">transient or per&#173;sis&#173;tent reduction in visual acuity</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">dyschromatopsias (alterations in color vision or perception)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">delayed photostress recovery (delayed adaptation to reduced lighting)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">photophobia</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">metamorphopsia (wavy or distorted vision)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">floaters</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">photopsia (flashes)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">scotomas (blind spots/areas)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">loss of visual field</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">nyctalopia (night blindness)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Part II, Disorders of the Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous, which includes Chapters&#160;4 through 18, discusses specific diseases of and trauma to the posterior segment. Appropriate diagnostic techniques are indicated throughout &#173;these discussions. By necessity, the illustrative findings associated with the described vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal disorders are presented as highlights—&#173;using schematics as well as the dif&#173;fer&#173;ent imaging technologies—&#173;rather than as a comprehensive collection. Narratives describing the management of, and therapy for, the ret&#173;i&#173;nal disorders covered in Part II are complemented by descriptions of the impor&#173;tant clinical &#173;trials that have helped establish appropriate evidence-&#173;based practices. &#173;Because of the increasing prevalence of myopia and its vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal complications, this edition features a new chapter dedicated to this topic (Chapter&#160;10: Myopia and Pathologic Myopia). In Part III, Selected Therapeutic Topics, Chapters&#160;19 and 20 offer more detailed information on the 3 most impor&#173;tant posterior segment treatment approaches: vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal surgery, &#173;laser surgery, and intravitreal injection of effective pharmacologic agents, especially anti–&#173;vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor treatments. The emergence of each of &#173;these treatment approaches has been associated with dramatic improvements in the outcomes ret&#173;ina specialists can accomplish in terms of preserving or restoring patients’ vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Increasingly, when treating patients with vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal disorders, clinicians base treatment decisions on evidence from clinical &#173;trials. Readers should familiarize themselves with &#173;those topics impor&#173;tant for interpreting the scientific lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture, such as study design, levels of evidence, results interpretation, and clinical practice applications of trial results (see BCSC Section&#160;1, <span class="I">Update on General Medicine,</span> Chapter&#160;1).</p>
			<p class="body-text">This book is not meant as a thorough review of the field but rather serves as what a group of experts considers the most impor&#173;tant highlights of the specialty. Thus, readers interested in more comprehensive information can obtain additional detail from the selected references as well as from references that appear at the end of the book on the Basic Texts page. Lastly, this edition includes a new feature: activities that &#173;will supplement the recently introduced videos in better illustrating specific topics; &#173;these features may be accessed through the print and electronic forms of this volume.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">The Vitreous</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top1"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vitreous is a transparent gel composed principally of &#173;water, collagen, and hyaluronic acid; it occupies 80% of the volume of the eye. The vitreous body is divided into 2 main topographic areas: the central, or core, and the peripheral, or cortical, vitreous. The vitreous gel is made up of collagen fibrils separated by hydrated hyaluronic acid molecules, which act as fillers and separators between adjacent collagen fibrils.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The anterior surface of the vitreous body is called the anterior cortical gel, made up of a condensation of collagenous fibers that attach to the posterior lens capsule, forming the ligament of Wieger (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-1</span>). The retrolental indentation of the anterior vitreous is called the patellar fossa. The potential space between the peripheral posterior lens and the anterior cortical gel bordered by the Wieger ligament is called the Berger space. In the vitreous base, the collagen fibers are particularly dense; they are firmly attached to the anterior ret&#173;ina and posterior pars plana, creating a ringlike area that extends approximately 2&#160;mm anterior and 3–4&#160;mm posterior to the ora serrata. The vitreous is not only attached at its base; it is also firmly attached to the lens capsule, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels, optic nerve, and macula. The densely packed collagen fibrils in the cortical vitreous form the cortical gel. Posteriorly, fibers course in a direction roughly parallel to the inner surface of the ret&#173;ina, forming the preret&#173;i&#173;nal tract. The vitreous attaches to the ret&#173;i&#173;nal surface, specifically the internal limiting membrane, via the adhesion molecules fibronectin and laminin. &#173;There is no basement membrane between the vitreous base and lens, an area called the annular gap, which is a ringlike zone impor&#173;tant for diffusion between the aqueous and vitreous compartments. The space known as the premacular bursa, or the precortical vitreous pocket (see Fig 1-1), which is anterior to the posterior attachment of the vitreous to the macula, is believed to decrease the tractional forces generated during ocular motion by the inertial movement of the vitreous relative to the macula. The vitreous inserts on the edges of the optic nerve head, creating a funnel-&#173;shaped void of vitreous. This void is the opening of the Cloquet canal and is referred to as the area of Martegiani. The anatomy of the vitreous is difficult to delineate in vivo; however, the vitreous appears to contain interconnected cisterns and canals, most notably the ciliobursal canal that connects the ciliary body and macula. The vitreous also contains hyalocytes, which arise from bone marrow–&#173;derived stem cells. Oxygen is derived from diffusion from choroidal and ret&#173;i&#173;nal circulation. Hyalocytes consume most of this, limiting the amount of oxygen that reaches the lens and anterior segment. The vitreous has high ascorbate levels, which protects against oxidative damage (eg, to the lens).</p>

			<div id="Chapt1_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Retinal Topography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The central area of the ret&#173;ina, or macula, mea&#173;sures approximately 5.5&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter and is centered between the optic nerve head and the temporal vascular arcades. On histologic examination, this area features 2 or more layers of ganglion cells, accounting for half of all the ganglion cells in the ret&#173;ina. Oxygenated carotenoids, in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar lutein and zeaxanthin, accumulate within the central macula and contribute to its yellow color.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The central 1.5&#160;mm of the macula, which is called the <span class="italic">fovea</span> (or <span class="italic">fovea centralis</span>), is specialized for high spatial acuity and color vision. The fovea has a margin, a downward slope, and a floor known as the <span class="italic">foveola,</span> a 0.35-&#173;mm-&#173;diameter region where cones are slender, elongated, and densely packed. At the very center of the foveola is a small depression, 150–200 µm in dia&#173;meter, known as the <span class="italic">umbo.</span> Within the fovea is a region devoid of ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels known as the <span class="italic">foveal avascular zone</span> (FAZ). The geometric center of the FAZ is often taken to be the center of the macula and thus the point of fixation; it is an impor&#173;tant landmark in fluorescein angiography. Surrounding the fovea is the <span class="italic">parafovea,</span> a ring 0.5&#160;mm in width where the ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer, and outer plexiform layer (also known as <span class="italic">Henle fiber layer</span>) are thickest. Surrounding this zone is the <span class="italic">perifovea</span>, a ring approximately 1.5&#160;mm wide (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;1-1</span>). Thus, the umbo forms the center of the macula, and the periphery of the perifovea forms its margin, which is sometimes referred to as the <span class="italic">area centralis</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ret&#173;ina outside the macula, sometimes referred to as the extra-&#173;areal periphery, is commonly divided into a few concentric regions, starting with the <span class="italic">near periphery,</span> a 1.5-mm ring peripheral to the temporal major vascular arcades<span class="italic">.</span> The <span class="italic">equatorial ret&#173;i&#173;na</span> is the ret&#173;ina around the equator<span class="italic">,</span> and the region anterior to the equatorial ret&#173;ina is called the <span class="italic">peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;na.</span> In the far periphery, the border between the ret&#173;ina and the pars plana is called the <span class="italic">ora serrata.</span> The posterior border of the vitreous base is typically located between the ora serrata and the equator of the eye. This region is where most ret&#173;i&#173;nal tears occur. Jetties of ret&#173;i&#173;nal tissue, called <span class="italic">dentate pro&#173;cesses,</span> extend anteriorly into the pars plana. &#173;These pro&#173;cesses are more prominent nasally. <span class="italic">Ora bays</span> are posterior extensions of the pars plana &#173;toward the ret&#173;ina. On occasion, dentate pro&#173;cesses may wrap around a portion of an ora bay to form an enclosed ora bay. A <span class="italic">meridional fold</span> is a radially oriented, prominent thickening of ret&#173;i&#173;nal tissue that extends into the pars plana. When aligned with a ciliary pro&#173;cess, such folds are known as a <span class="italic">meridional complex</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Retinal Layers and Neurosensory Ele&#173;ments</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The layers of the ret&#173;ina can be seen in cross-&#173;sectional histologic preparations, and most layers can be identified with spectral-&#173;domain optical coherence tomography (SD-&#173;OCT) (see Activity 2-1). The layers of the ret&#173;ina as seen on histologic section, in order from the inner to outer ret&#173;ina, are listed &#173;here (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-4</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">internal limiting membrane (ILM)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">nerve fiber layer (NFL; the axons of the ganglion cell layer)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ganglion cell layer (GCL)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">inner plexiform layer (IPL)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">inner nuclear layer (INL)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;middle limiting membrane (MLM)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">outer plexiform layer (OPL)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Henle fiber layer (HFL)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">outer nuclear layer (ONL; the nuclei of the photoreceptors)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">external limiting membrane (ELM)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">rod and cone inner segments (IS)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">rod and cone outer segments (OS)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">To reach the photoreceptors, light must travel through the full thickness of the ret&#173;ina. The density and distribution of photoreceptors vary with their topographic location. In the fovea, densely packed cones are predominantly red-&#173; and green-&#173;sensitive, with a density exceeding 140,000 cones/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>. The foveola has no rods; the fovea contains only photoreceptors, rods and cones, and pro&#173;cesses of M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells. The number of cone photoreceptors decreases rapidly in areas farther away from the center, even though 90% of cones overall reside outside the foveal region. The rods have their greatest density in a zone lying approximately 4&#160;mm from the foveal center, or 12° from fixation, where they reach a peak density of about 160,000 rods/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>. The density of rods also decreases &#173;toward the periphery. A small area of high rod concentration (176,000 rods/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>) has been found in the superior macula. The arrangement of rods and cones can be visualized with noninvasive adaptive optics imaging (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The light-&#173;sensitive molecules in rods and cones are derived from vitamin A and are contained in the disc membranes of the photoreceptor outer segments. The discs are attached to a cilium, which is rooted through neurotubules in the ellipsoid and myoid of the inner segment. The ellipsoid, which is adjacent to the cilium, contains mitochondria and is responsible for the cone shape. The myoid, which is closer to the photoreceptor nucleus, contains endoplasmic reticulum. The mitochondria, cilia, and inner discs together form the <span class="italic">inner-&#173;outer segment junction,</span> which provides evidence of the origin of the photoreceptor as a modified sensory cilium prone to the full range of ciliopathies. Rod outer segments may contain up to 1000 discs stacked like coins. &#173;These discs are renewed in and shed from the outer ret&#173;ina and are phagocytosed by the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE) for pro&#173;cessing and recycling of components (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-6</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cone photoreceptors have a 1-&#173;to-1 synapse with a type of bipolar cell known as a <span class="italic">midget bipolar cell.</span> Other types of bipolar cells also synapse with each cone. Conversely, more than 1 rod—&#173;and sometimes more than 100 rods—&#173;converge on each bipolar cell. Bipolar cells, the first neurons of the visual pathway, synapse with ganglion cells, the second neurons of the visual pathway in the IPL. The ganglion cells summate responses from bipolar and amacrine cells and develop action potentials that are conducted to the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus and the third neuron in the brain. Amacrine cells on the inside of the INL help pro&#173;cess signals by responding to specific alterations in ret&#173;i&#173;nal stimuli, such as sudden changes in light intensity or the presence of certain sizes of stimuli. The outside of the INL is composed of horizontal cells. In the NFL, axons of the GCL course along the inner portion of the ret&#173;ina to form the optic nerve, a brain tract. The ILM, which is formed by the footplates of M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells, is attached to the posterior cortical gel of the vitreous (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-7</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Two additional intraret&#173;i&#173;nal “membranes” identified by histologists, the ELM and MLM, are actually junctional systems, not true membranes. At the outer extent of the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells, zonular attachments between photoreceptors and M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells create the ELM, a structure vis&#173;i&#173;ble with both light microscopy and OCT. Thus, the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells whose nuclei reside in the INL course through almost the entire thickness of the ret&#173;ina. The inner third of the OPL has a linear density in which synaptic and desmosomal connections occur between the photoreceptor inner fibers and the pro&#173;cesses of the bipolar cells. This linear density, which is also apparent with OCT, is the junctional system that has been called the MLM.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Vasculature and Oxygen Supply</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vascular supply of the ret&#173;ina comes from the ret&#173;i&#173;nal circulation for the inner ret&#173;ina, and indirectly from the choroidal circulation for the avascular outer ret&#173;ina. The central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery (a branch of the ophthalmic artery) enters the eye and divides into 4&#160;branches, each supplying blood to a quadrant of the ret&#173;ina. &#173;These branches are located in the inner ret&#173;ina. Occasionally, a cilioret&#173;i&#173;nal artery, derived from the ciliary circulation, &#173;will supply a portion of the inner ret&#173;ina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-8</span>). On a tissue level, the ret&#173;ina is supplied by up to 4 layers of vessels: the <span class="italic">radial peripapillary capillary network</span> located in the nerve fiber layer and around the optic nerve head, the <span class="italic">superficial vascular plexus</span> in the ret&#173;i&#173;nal ganglion cell layer, and the <span class="italic">deep capillary plexus</span> with 2 capillary beds, one on &#173;either side of the INL. Although the superficial layer of the deep capillary plexus is sometimes referred to as the intermediate capillary plexus, typically both layers are collectively referred to as the deep capillary plexus. With the advent of OCT angiography, which is able to visualize &#173;these distinct capillary layers, interest in this anatomy has grown. The ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculature, including its capillaries, retains the blood–&#173;brain barrier with tight junctions between capillary endothelial cells. Blood from the capillaries is collected by the ret&#173;i&#173;nal venous system; it eventually leaves the eye through the central ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein by way of branch ret&#173;i&#173;nal veins.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal layers, beginning with the outer plexiform layer, derive their oxygen supply from the choroidal circulation. The exact boundary between the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular supply and the diffusion from the choriocapillaris varies according to the topographic location, ret&#173;i&#173;nal thickness, and amount of light pres&#173;ent. See also the section Choroid &#173;later in this chapter, as well as Part I, Anatomy, of BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology.</span></p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Retinal Pigment Epithelium</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The RPE is a monolayer of pigmented cells derived from the outer layer of the optic cup. This layer is continuous with the pigment epithelium of the ciliary body and iris. RPE cells are hexagonal, cuboidal cells approximately 16 µm in dia&#173;meter. In the macula, however, the cells are taller and denser than in the periphery. The lateral surfaces of adjacent cells are closely apposed and joined by tight junctional complexes (zonulae occludentes) near the apices, forming apical girdles and the outer blood–&#173;ocular barrier. Each RPE cell has an apex and base; the apical portion envelops the outer segments of the photoreceptor cells with villous pro&#173;cesses (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-9</span>). The basal surface of the cells shows a rich infolding of the plasma membrane. The basement membrane does not follow &#173;these infoldings. The typical RPE cell has several melanosomes, each designed to absorb light. Melanosomes are spheroidal; their melanin is distributed on protein fibers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The RPE contributes to ret&#173;i&#173;nal function in several ways; it</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">absorbs light</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">phagocytoses rod and cone outer segments</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">participates in ret&#173;i&#173;nal and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">forms the outer blood–&#173;ocular barrier</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">maintains the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">heals and forms scar tissue</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">regenerates and recycles visual pigment</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">RPE cells serve a phagocytic function, continually ingesting the disc membranes shed by the outer segments of the photoreceptor cells. Over the course of a lifetime, each RPE cell is thought to phagocytose billions of outer segments. This pro&#173;cess of shedding, phagocytosis, and photoreceptor renewal follows a daily (circadian) rhythm. Rods shed discs at dawn, and cones shed them at dusk. The ingested outer segments are digested gradually, broken down by enzymes from <span class="italic">lysosomes.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Visual pigments contain 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis</span>-&#173;retinaldehyde that is converted to 11-<span class="italic">trans</span>-retinal&#173;dehyde in the outer segments of the ret&#173;ina. Most of regeneration of the 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis</span> to the 11-&#173;<span class="italic">trans</span> configuration occurs in the RPE and requires a highly efficient transfer of metabolites from the outer segments to the RPE cells and back. The interdigitation of the RPE and outer segments help facilitate the regeneration by increasing the surface area of contact and allowing for close proximity. The visual pigments’ biochemical cycle is discussed in more detail in BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">A variety of pathologic changes—&#173;caused by such &#173;factors as ge&#173;ne&#173;tic defects, drugs, dietary insufficiency (of vitamin A), or senescence—&#173;can impair the pro&#173;cess of phagocytosis and renewal. Physical separation of the ret&#173;ina from the RPE, which occurs when subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid (ie, ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment) or blood is pres&#173;ent, also disrupts the impor&#173;tant exchange of metabolites.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The RPE functions as a barrier to prevent diffusion of metabolites between the choroid and the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space. &#173;Because of this, the environment of the photoreceptors is largely regulated by the selective transport properties of the RPE. The RPE has a high capacity for &#173;water transport, so in a healthy eye, fluid does not accumulate in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space. This RPE-&#173;mediated dehydration of the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space also modulates the bonding properties of the interphotoreceptor matrix, which acts as a bridge between the RPE and photoreceptors and helps bond the neurosensory ret&#173;ina to the RPE. With deterioration or loss of the RPE, &#173;there is corresponding atrophy of the overlying photoreceptors and under&#173;lying choriocapillaris.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Bruch Membrane</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The basal portion of the RPE is attached to Bruch membrane, which has 5 layers. Starting with the innermost, &#173;these layers (see Fig 1-9) are the</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-6">basement membrane of the RPE</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">inner collagenous zone</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;middle layer of elastic fibers</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">outer collagenous zone</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-7">basement membrane of the endothelium of the choriocapillaris</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Degeneration of Bruch membrane over time is associated with buildup of lipids and oxidatively damaged materials as well as calcification. In some disease states, such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum, extensive Bruch membrane calcification leads to fractures, for example, angioid streaks. In age-&#173;related macular degeneration, areas of calcification with microscopic breaks have also been found.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Choroid</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blood enters the choroid through the posterior ciliary arteries (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-10</span>). The outer layer of large-&#173;caliber choroidal vessels, known as the Haller layer, is relatively thick. The choroidal vessels in this layer divide into smaller-&#173;diameter vessels and precapillary arterioles in a layer known as the Sattler layer. &#173;These vessels distribute the blood throughout the choroid, reducing arterial pressure to the relatively low pressure found in the choriocapillaris. The choroid has a maximal thickness posteriorly. On histologic examination, it is 0.22&#160;mm thick in the central macular region, becoming progressively thinner anteriorly; at the ora serrata, it is 0.1&#160;mm thick. Subfoveal choroidal thickness mea&#173;sured in vivo among healthy volunteers with a mean age of 50&#160;years by SD-&#173;OCT is approximately 287 µm. However, thickness changes with age and disease states of the eye. The presence of thin choroid (leptochoroid) and thick choroid (pachychoroid) is associated with ocular disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the posterior pole, the choriocapillaris forms a plexus of capillaries, even though the capillaries themselves are not arranged strictly into lobules. The capillary arrangement becomes more irregular &#173;toward the periphery, where the capillaries are arranged more radially. Interspersed between the vessels of the choroid are loose connective tissue, fibroblasts, and melanocytes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;After passing through the choriocapillaris, the blood is collected in venules, which coalesce into collecting channels, or ampullae, of the vortex veins. Most eyes have 4 or 5&#160;vortex veins, which exit the eye at or posterior to the equator. The vortex veins drain into the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The choroid supplies the metabolic needs of the ret&#173;ina, which has one of the highest metabolic rates per gram of tissue in the body. In some estimates, the choroidal circulation supplies 90% of the oxygen consumed by the ret&#173;ina, primarily by the photoreceptors. The choroid also has the highest blood flow of any tissue, and the venous blood exiting the choroid still has a very high oxygen tension. The RPE cells, which are anatomically closely associated with the choriocapillaris, are exposed to the highest oxygen tensions of any perfused tissue, increasing the risk of oxidative damage. The rapid flow in the choroid also acts as a heat sink, removing thermal energy obtained by light absorption.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Sclera</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The sclera is composed of collagen and a few elastic fibers embedded in a matrix of proteoglycans. It terminates at the histologists’ limbus. The sclera does not have uniform thickness; it is thinnest immediately &#173;behind the muscle insertion, whereas it is thicker just posterior to the limbus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The sclera is normally permeable to the passage of molecules in both directions. Up to 40% of the aqueous leaves the eye via uveoscleral outflow, making the sclera an impor&#173;tant path of fluid movement. Scleral permeability allows drugs to be delivered to the eye by means of injection into the sub-Tenon space. The sclera is a hydrophilic tissue and is therefore only variably permeable to hydrophobic or amphiphilic substances or medi&#173;cations. This characteristic is an impor&#173;tant consideration for periocular injection of pharmacologic agents.</p>
