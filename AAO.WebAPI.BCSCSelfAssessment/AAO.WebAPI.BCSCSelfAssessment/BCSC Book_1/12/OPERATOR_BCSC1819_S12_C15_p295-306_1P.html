			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxicities caused by systemic therapeutics may be categorized according to the level and pattern of toxicity. Broadly, &#173;these toxicities consist of (1) abnormalities at the level of the RPE/photoreceptor complex, (2) occlusive retinopathy or microvasculopathy, (3) ganglion cell and optic nerve toxicities, and (4) other manifestations of toxicity that include macular edema, crystalline retinopathy, and alterations in color vision and electroretinogram (ERG) signals.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Chloroquine Derivatives</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxicity from <span class="italic">chloroquine</span> use remains a prob&#173;lem in many parts of the world, it is rare in the United States, where this medi&#173;cation has largely been replaced by the much safer, related drug <span class="italic">hydroxychloroquine.</span> &#173;These medi&#173;cations are used for the treatment of malaria and rheumatologic and dermatologic disorders. Both medi&#173;cations bind to melanin in the RPE, which may concentrate or prolong their effects. Although the incidence of toxicity is low, it is a serious concern &#173;because associated vision loss rarely recovers and may even pro&#173;gress &#173;after the drug is discontinued. Patients and their primary care physicians must be made aware of the ophthalmic risks and the need for regular screening examinations to detect ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxicity at an early stage, before vision loss occurs. Typical symptoms can include paracentral scotomas, central visual decline, and/or reading difficulty.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The earliest signs of toxicity include bilateral paracentral visual field defects and/or inner segment ellipsoid loss in a paracentral location, which appears as the “flying saucer” sign on spectral-&#173;domain optical coherence tomography (SD-&#173;OCT) imaging. However, most patients of Asian descent &#173;will show initial damage in a more peripheral extramacular distribution. With continued drug exposure, progressive pigmentary changes may develop, and a bilateral atrophic bull’s-&#173;eye maculopathy may ensue (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-1</span>). End-&#173;stage cases of advanced toxicity may show panret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration that simulates retinitis pigmentosa; this degeneration can occur from long-&#173;term exposure to &#173;either drug or from acute overdosing of chloroquine. In some patients, corneal intraepithelial deposits, usually referred to as <span class="italic">corneal verticillata,</span> may also be observed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ophthalmic screening of patients receiving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is aimed primarily at early detection and minimization of toxicity. As summarized in a 2016 Clinical Statement from the American Acad&#173;emy of Ophthalmology (<a href="https://www.aao.org/clinical-statement/revised-recommendations-on-screening-chloroquine-h"><span class="Hyperlink">www.&#173;aao.&#173;org/&#173;clinical-&#173;statement/&#173;revised-&#173;recommendations-&#173;on-&#173;screening-&#173;chloroquine-&#173;h</span></a>), the risk of toxicity is low for individuals who have no complicating conditions and take less than 6.5&#160;mg/kg/day of hydroxychloroquine or 3&#160;mg/kg/day of chloroquine. The most recent data suggest that a hydroxychloroquine dosage of 5.0&#160;mg/kg/day and a chloroquine dosage of 2.3&#160;mg/kg/day based on the patient’s real body weight may be safer across all body mass indexes than the dosage recommendation of 6.5&#160;mg/kg/day and 3&#160;mg/kg/day, respectively using the patient’s ideal body weight.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cumulative total doses greater than 1000&#160;g of hydroxychloroquine and 460&#160;g of chloroquine place patients at high risk of toxicity. Additional risk &#173;factors include duration of use (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>5&#160;years), kidney disease, concomitant use of tamoxifen (5-&#173;fold increase), and concomitant ret&#173;i&#173;nal disease such as age-&#173;related macular degeneration (AMD). The latter can also make early detection of toxicity difficult. Furthermore, well-&#173;documented but rare cases of hydroxychloroquine maculopathy have occurred with “safe” daily doses and in the absence of other risk &#173;factors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Baseline evaluation for patients beginning treatment with a chloroquine derivative should include a complete ophthalmic examination. For follow-up comparison, the ophthalmologist should employ SD-&#173;OCT as well as automated threshold field testing with a white pattern (Humphrey white 10-2 protocol), although some clinicians prefer red for its increased sensitivity. Current guidelines recommend a baseline fundus examination within the first year of use, then annual screening &#173;after 5&#160;years of use in patients at low risk for toxicity. Many prac&#173;ti&#173;tion&#173;ers, however, screen patients &#173;every 6 to 12 months with a combination of Humphrey 10-2 and SD-&#173;OCT &#173;until 5&#160;years and then &#173;every 6 months thereafter. Patients who are at risk of toxicity or have unclear symptoms can be further assessed with fundus autofluorescence and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG). Signs of toxicity include a paracentral ring of hyperautofluorescence or hypoautofluorescence and paracentral mfERG depressions. Cessation of the drug at the first sign of toxicity is recommended.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Phenothiazines</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phenothiazines, including <span class="italic">chlorpromazine</span> and <span class="italic">thioridazine,</span> are concentrated in uveal tissue and RPE by binding to melanin granules. High-&#173;dose chlorpromazine therapy commonly &#173;causes abnormal pigmentation of the eyelids, interpalpebral conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior lens capsule. Anterior and posterior subcapsular cataracts may also develop. However, pigmentary retinopathy from chlorpromazine therapy is unusual.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In contrast, high-&#173;dose thioridazine treatment can cause development of a severe pigmentary retinopathy within a few weeks or months of dosing initiation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-2</span>). Toxicity is rare at doses of 800&#160;mg/day or lower. Initially, patients experience blurred vision, and the fundus shows coarse ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelial stippling in the posterior pole. Eventually, patchy nummular atrophy of the RPE and choriocapillaris may develop. The late stages may be mistaken for choroideremia or Bietti crystalline dystrophy; late-&#173;stage symptoms include visual field loss and nyctalopia (night blindness).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Generally, patients taking thioridazine are not monitored ophthalmoscopically &#173;because toxicity is rare at standard doses. However, symptomatic patients or patients suspected of having toxicity, especially &#173;those who have taken high doses of the drug, should undergo a full ret&#173;i&#173;nal evaluation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Miscellaneous Medi&#173;cations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Other systemic medi&#173;cations that can induce toxicity of the RPE include clofazimine, deferoxamine, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). <span class="italic">Clofazimine</span> is a phenazine dye used to treat dapsone-&#173;resistant leprosy and vari&#173;ous autoimmune disorders, such as psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Its toxicity manifests as a bull’s-&#173;eye maculopathy. <span class="italic">Deferoxamine</span> is an iron-&#173;chelating agent, which can cause reticular or vitelliform ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelial changes in the macula and can be associated with macular edema caused by ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelial pump failure. NRTIs such as <span class="italic">dideoxyinosine</span> have been used in the systemic treatment of patients infected with HIV to inhibit replication of the virus. However, this class of medi&#173;cations can cause mitochondrial toxicity and damage to tissues with high oxygen requirements, such as the optic nerve and RPE. Patients may develop peripheral vision loss associated with a bilateral, symmetric, and midperipheral pattern of concentric mottling and atrophy of the RPE and choriocapillaris. The fundus changes are most readily identified with fundus autofluorescence imaging.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">MEK inhibitors,</span> a class of drugs used as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of metastatic cancers, can cause a condition similar to central serous chorioretinopathy. This condition is characterized by multifocal serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-3</span>). In rare instances, the use of <span class="italic">sildenafil</span> has been associated with serous macular detachment and central serous chorioretinopathy, presumably caused by choroidal vascular dilation and choroidal congestion manifesting as increased choroidal thickness on enhanced depth imaging (EDI) SD-&#173;OCT. <span class="italic">Corticosteroids</span> are the most common medi&#173;cations to be associated with the development of central serous chorioretinopathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">alkyl nitrites</span> (“poppers”) are a class of drugs used for recreation. The chemicals are inhaled to induce euphoria and relax smooth muscles, usually in preparation for sexual activity; in rare cases, &#173;these drugs can cause a toxic maculopathy. Patients are typically young and pres&#173;ent with central scotoma or photopsia. Fundus examination may demonstrate a yellow spot on the fovea. SD-&#173;OCT imaging may reveal focal disruption of the central inner segment ellipsoid band, indicating an abnormality of the foveal cones (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-4</span>).</p>

			<div id="Chapt15_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Interferon alfa-2a</span> is an antiviral and immunomodulatory drug used for the treatment of viral hepatitis. This treatment may be complicated by the development of cotton-&#173;wool spots and ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages. Affected patients may experience symptoms such as paracentral visual field defects. Ergot alkaloids (vasoconstrictors used to treat migraines) and oral contraceptives have been associated with thrombotic complications, including ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein and ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusions. <span class="italic">Procainamide</span> can induce systemic lupus erythematosus and cause extensive “pruning” of second-&#173;order ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels and infarction of the ret&#173;ina, leading to severe vision loss.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The aminoglycosides <span class="italic">amikacin</span> and especially <span class="italic">gentamicin</span>—&#173;administered intraocularly but not systemically—&#173;can cause macular infarction and severe macular ischemia, leading to irreversible central vision loss. &#173;These agents’ narrow therapeutic win&#173;dow has caused their use to decline. Recently, hemorrhagic occlusive ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis (HORV) has been associated with intracameral <span class="italic">vancomycin</span> use for prophylaxis of endophthalmitis in rare instances. HORV is associated with widespread ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular occlusion and subsequent nonperfusion. The pathogenesis is unclear but is presumed to be a type III hypersensitivity reaction mediated by antibody/antigen complex deposition causing small vessel vasculitis.</p>

			<div id="Chapt15_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Quinine</span> is used as a muscle relaxant for leg cramps and as an antimalarial. It has a narrow therapeutic index that is safe at doses &#173;under 2&#160;g, but it &#173;causes morbidity at doses greater than 4&#160;g and mortality at doses greater than 8&#160;g. At toxic levels, acute severe vision loss may occur as a result of ret&#173;i&#173;nal ganglion cell toxicity, mimicking a central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion. A cherry-&#173;red spot may be observed, and SD-&#173;OCT imaging may demonstrate ganglion cell layer thickening and hyperreflectivity. Diffuse inner-&#173;retinal atrophy &#173;will ensue, accompanied by ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular attenuation and optic atrophy. Full-&#173;field ERG testing &#173;will show a negative waveform signal, similar to that observed with a central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-5</span>). Blindness caused by quinine toxicity is permanent.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Methanol</span> toxicity &#173;causes acute blindness. Posterior segment manifestations include acute transient optic nerve head and macular edema. In histologic studies of acute methanol toxicity, the ret&#173;ina, RPE, and optic nerve demonstrate vacuolization, a sign of cell death. Eventually, optic atrophy and occasionally ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular attenuation caused by diffuse ganglion cell loss may develop. Full-&#173;field ERG testing shows an electronegative waveform. The most commonly reported sequela of methanol toxicity is optic atrophy.</p>

			<p class="h1">Drugs Causing Macular Edema</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">taxanes</span> are a class of microtubule inhibitors that include <span class="italic">paclitaxel,</span> albumin-&#173;bound paclitaxel, and <span class="italic">docetaxel.</span> &#173;These drugs are employed as chemotherapeutics for the treatment of vari&#173;ous cancers, including breast carcinoma. In rare cases, they are associated with cystoid macular edema (CME) that is vis&#173;i&#173;ble on examination or SD-&#173;OCT but not on fluorescein angiography. Similarly, the cholesterol-&#173;lowering agent <span class="italic">nicotinic acid</span> can produce angiographically &#173;silent CME. Initially, central vision may be impaired, but full recovery follows discontinuation of the drug and resolution of the cystoid edema.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The glitazones <span class="italic">rosiglitazone</span> and <span class="italic">pioglitazone</span> are oral hypoglycemics used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. They can cause severe fluid retention, leading to pulmonary edema, and are occasionally associated with the development or exacerbation of macular edema. <span class="italic">Fingolimod,</span> which is an oral agent used in the management of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, can infrequently cause macular edema, usually within 3 months of initiation of treatment; the edema resolves with cessation. Topical prostaglandin F<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span><span class="greek_subscript CharOverride-1">α</span> analogs have been reported in small case series to cause macular edema. Deferoxamine may also cause secondary macular edema caused by RPE toxicity, as mentioned earlier in the chapter.</p>

			<p class="h1">Drugs Causing Crystalline Retinopathy</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Crystalline retinopathies can be caused by systemic medi&#173;cations and other agents and can be associated with ocular and systemic diseases not discussed in this chapter (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;15-1</span>). <span class="italic">Tamoxifen</span> is an antiestrogen drug used as adjuvant therapy following primary treatment for breast cancer. Retinopathy is rare at typical doses (20&#160;mg daily), but crystalline retinopathy has been reported in patients receiving high-&#173;dose tamoxifen therapy (daily doses greater than 200&#160;mg or cumulative doses greater than 100&#160;g). The maculopathy is characterized by brilliant inner-&#173;retinal crystalline deposits clustered around the fovea and may be associated with CME and significant vision loss in severe cases; it may be irreversible. More recently, in rare instances SD-&#173;OCT imaging has revealed central loss of the inner segment ellipsoid band in patients receiving low-&#173;dose tamoxifen therapy, without crystals vis&#173;i&#173;ble on funduscopic examination (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-6</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A crystalline maculopathy may also occur &#173;after ingestion of high doses of <span class="italic">canthaxanthine,</span> a widely available carotenoid used to simulate tanning. The inner-&#173;retinal, glistening canthaxanthine deposits distribute in a doughnut pattern around the macula, with a predilection for the juxtapapillary region, but they do not typically cause vision loss and may resolve &#173;after the medi&#173;cation is discontinued.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intravascular crystalline deposits of oxalate have been observed &#173;after the ingestion of ethylene glycol and &#173;after prolonged administration of <span class="italic">methoxyflurane</span> anesthesia (an agent that is no longer used in the United States) in patients with renal dysfunction. Other ret&#173;i&#173;nal crystals that may be deposited intravascularly include talc emboli, which are injected along with drugs such as methylphenidate in long-&#173;term intravenous drug abusers. The refractile talc deposits usually embolize in the smaller-&#173;caliber perifoveal ret&#173;i&#173;nal arterioles and may cause peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization in rare cases; they do not typically cause vision loss.</p>
			<p class="body-text">West African crystalline maculopathy was first reported in el&#173;derly persons from the Igbo tribe of Nigeria but has been noted in patients from other countries in this region as well. Affected individuals are typically diabetic and demonstrate benign, inert inner-&#173;retinal refractile crystals of the fovea that are yellow-&#173;green in color (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-7</span>). &#173;These crystals, which have been linked to long-&#173;term ingestion of kola nuts, are not associated with vision loss.</p>
