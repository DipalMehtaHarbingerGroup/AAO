			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man</span> (OMIM) website lists more than 750 ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorders with significant involvement of the ret&#173;ina, choroid, or both. The Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Information network online, <span class="italic">RetNet,</span> lists nearly 300 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ret&#173;i&#173;nal degenerations in which the chromosomal site, and often the specific gene defect, have been identified. &#173;Table&#160;13-1 summarizes known ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies and their associated genes and loci. Despite their numerous distinctive clinical features, &#173;these conditions are characterized by multiple genes that give rise to the same phenotype (<span class="italic">ge&#173;ne&#173;tic heterogeneity</span>) as well as diverse pheno&#173;types that share common causative genes (<span class="italic">variable expressivity</span>). Conversely, defects in a particular gene can give rise to different phenotypes; this is referred to as pleiotropy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The disorders have been divided by 2 anatomic classifications: (1) apparent topography or (2) layer of involvement, such as ret&#173;ina, macula, ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE), choroid, and vitreous/ret&#173;i&#173;na; however, &#173;these distinctions do not always correspond to the sites of the causative gene expression. A second system of organ&#173;ization classifies the disorders based on the inheritance pattern of the disease; however, some genes have variants that can give rise to &#173;either autosomal or X-&#173;linked dominant or autosomal or X-&#173;linked recessive inheritance, respectively. A third approach classifies the disorders by disease phenotype based on clinical examination and electrophysiological and psychophysical testing, but many genes can give rise to overlapping phenotypes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For con&#173;ve&#173;nience, this chapter organizes the ret&#173;i&#173;nal and choroidal dystrophies based on clinical phenotypes and anatomic involvement, rather than on molecular ge&#173;ne&#173;tics. Thus, the reader &#173;will note that some genes are causative across multiple phenotypes, and only in rare instances is a specific phenotype defined by a unique causative gene. Disorders with primary diffuse photoreceptor involvement are classified separately from &#173;those with predominantly macular involvement, for which the symptoms and prognoses generally differ. The diffuse photoreceptor dystrophy category of disorders is further subcategorized into rod-&#173;dominant, cone-&#173;dominant, and choroidal syndromes and diseases.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">General Diagnostic Considerations</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hereditary diseases of the eye have bilateral symmetric involvement, with rare exceptions. If ocular involvement is unilateral, other &#173;causes—&#173;such as birth defects, intrauterine or antenatal infections, or inflammatory diseases—&#173;should be considered. &#173;Because ret&#173;i&#173;nal degenerations can also occur as part of a systemic disorder, obtaining a thorough medical history is crucial (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span>), as is ruling out any reversible or treatable cause of ret&#173;i&#173;nal dysfunction, such as vitamin A deficiency, autoimmune disorders, or paraneoplastic or infectious retinopathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinical diagnostic evaluation, assessment of disease severity, and monitoring the progression of chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies usually involve some combination of electroretinography, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and perimetric testing. Several photoreceptor dystrophies have typical phenotypes, such as the deep ret&#173;i&#173;nal white dots or flecks in <span class="italic">retinitis punctata albescens</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-1</span>), choriocapillaris atrophy in <span class="italic">choroideremia</span> (<span class="italic">CHM</span>), ret&#173;i&#173;nal thickening and loss of laminations resulting from mutations in <span class="italic">CRB1</span>, crystalline deposits associated with <span class="italic">Bietti crystalline dystrophy</span> (<span class="italic">CYP4V2</span>), or the preserved para-&#173;arteriolar RPE in <span class="italic">CRB1</span>-&#173;related retinopathy. Distinctive phenotypes are the exception, however, and in most cases of photoreceptor dystrophy, &#173;there are diffuse pigment epithelial changes that are secondary effects of the diffuse photoreceptor degeneration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Generally, panret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies or degenerations of the RPE and ret&#173;ina are divided into 2 groups: (1)&#160;nonsyndromic retinopathies and (2)&#160;syndromic retinopathies. The term <span class="italic">nonsyndromic panret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies</span> refers to hereditary disorders that diffusely involve photoreceptor and pigment epithelial function; &#173;these conditions are characterized by progressive visual field loss, central vision loss, and abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) responses. The disease pro&#173;cess is confined to the eyes and is not associated with other systemic manifestations. In <span class="italic">syndromic (secondary) panret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies,</span> the ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration is associated with single–&#173; or multiple–&#173;organ system disease, such as hearing loss (Usher syndrome) or multisystem disorders (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span>). Occasionally, when the etiology is unknown and no associated disease is pres&#173;ent, the term <span class="italic">pigmentary retinopathy</span> is used to describe the disorder.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">General Genetic Considerations</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All inheritance patterns are represented among currently known inherited ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies. Thus, obtaining an accurate and complete &#173;family history is essential in determining the dystrophy’s inheritance pattern (ie, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-&#173;linked recessive, X-&#173;linked dominant, or mitochondrial). However, patients with ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies may have a negative &#173;family history for a variety of reasons, including lack of information, variable expressivity and/or incomplete penetrance within the &#173;family, or de novo mutations. It is helpful to examine relatives for any signs of asymptomatic ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Molecular ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing can help establish an inheritance pattern; de novo mutations in X-&#173;linked and autosomal dominant genes can be occasionally observed in sporadic rod–&#173;cone or cone dystrophy cases. The expression of &#173;these disorders can vary widely even within &#173;family members that share the same causative mutations. Molecular ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing helps differentiate the specific causative genes within this phenotypic group; it can be useful for &#173;family planning purposes &#173;because of the multiple pos&#173;si&#173;ble inheritance patterns.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Genes that &#173;were previously thought to only give rise to stationary conditions, such as congenital stationary night blindness and achromatopsias, have since been linked to some progressive cases. In some cases, both dominant and recessive forms have been seen, resulting from mutations in the same gene. Molecular ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing is also useful for identifying syndromic versus nonsyndromic &#173;causes of ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies, but it does not predict the penetrance, expressivity, and/or rate of progression of &#173;these conditions. Testing in asymptomatic individuals to determine a potential &#173;future risk of vision loss is generally not warranted (&#173;unless a treatment is available). Clinicians can consult the American Acad&#173;emy of Ophthalmology’s guidelines for ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing and consider the use of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counseling ser&#173;vices when offering testing to their patients and &#173;family members.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">General Management Considerations</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Management of patients with ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration should include ophthalmic evaluations &#173;every 1–2&#160;years. Follow-up visits are appropriate to address refractive management and monitor for the development of cystoid macular edema (CME), cataract, glaucoma, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal exudation. CME, which develops in 10%–20% of patients with ret&#173;i&#173;nal degenerations, especially retinitis pigmentosa, can be managed in a subset of &#173;these patients with oral and/or topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-2</span>) or with periocular or intravitreal ste&#173;roids. Cataract surgery has a higher complication rate in part due to zonular instability. Following surgery, posterior capsular opacification and CME are more common. Assessment of optic nerve for the development of glaucoma or optic nerve head drusen (common in retinitis pigmentosa) is impor&#173;tant. Approximately 2%–5% of patients with panret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies &#173;will develop areas of an acquired Coats reaction (ie, hyperpermeability and exudation of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels, which can lead to exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments). &#173;These areas require treatment to preserve vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies may understandably fear that they &#173;will become blind in the near &#173;future. The clinician should help &#173;these patients understand that total blindness is&#160;an infrequent endpoint, but also that the diseases’ impact on visual function (eg, reduced visual acuity, reduced visual field) may affect their activities and quality of life. The clinician should also explain that while most patients retain vision for de&#173;cades, the progression of this condition is variable, and that it is pos&#173;si&#173;ble to adapt to the vari&#173;ous aspects of vision loss. Patients and their &#173;family members often experience guilt or fear of passing on the condition to their progeny; they may benefit from psychological and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counseling. Patients with subnormal visual acuity may benefit from low-&#173;vision aids, while patients with advanced disease may need vocational rehabilitation and mobility training. The clinician should refer patients for &#173;these ser&#173;vices before the patients are seriously limited by vision loss.

			<p class="body-text">Stem cell and gene therapies are being developed to modify the natu&#173;ral history of ret&#173;i&#173;nal and chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal degenerations, or even to restore function already lost.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Diffuse Photoreceptor Dystrophies</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Rod–&#173;cone dystrophies (retinitis pigmentosa)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with rod–&#173;cone dystrophies, usually referred to as <span class="italic">retinitis pigmentosa</span> (RP)—&#173;a term no longer preferred but still widely used—&#173;often pres&#173;ent with history of nyctalopia (night blindness) and reports of vision changes that relate to visual field loss. The history may not be clear; patients may assume that their visual function is normal, &#173;because it is “normal” for them not to be able to see in the dark. It is impor&#173;tant to ask the patient (and &#173;family members, in some instances) questions that properly assess them for vision dysfunction. Typical fundus findings in RP include arteriolar narrowing, with or without optic nerve head pallor, and variable amounts of bone spicule–&#173;like pigment changes resulting from intraret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment deposition by macrophages that migrate into the ret&#173;ina to pro&#173;cess degenerating ret&#173;i&#173;nal cells (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-3</span>). This form of pigment deposition within the ret&#173;ina occurs in regions of outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy (eg, following ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment or inflammatory retinopathies) and is not specific to hereditary retinopathies. The peripheral ret&#173;ina and RPE may be atrophic even if intraret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment is absent <span class="italic">(RP sine pigmento),</span> and the&#160;macula typically shows a loss of the foveal reflex and irregularity of the vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal interface. Autofluorescence imaging can often identify additional areas of ret&#173;i&#173;nal involvement that are not evident on clinical examination. Vitreous cells, CME, epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membranes, optic nerve drusen, and posterior subcapsular cataracts are commonly observed in eyes with panret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-4</span>). Eyes with rod–&#173;cone degenerations typically develop partial-&#173; to full-&#173;ring scotomas in midequatorial regions; &#173;these often expand into the periphery, leaving only a small central island of visual field (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ERG response in eyes with rod–&#173;cone dystrophies typically shows a loss or a marked reduction in rod-&#173;derived responses, more than in cone-&#173;derived responses. Both a-&#160;and b-&#173;waves are reduced &#173;because the photoreceptors are primarily involved. The b-&#173;waves are characteristically prolonged in time as well as diminished in amplitude. Individuals with the carrier state of X-&#173;linked recessive RP often show a mild reduction or delay in b-&#173;wave responses. Eyes with postinflammatory retinopathies (eg, retinopathies resulting from rubella) often have better preservation of the ERG than eyes with comparably appearing pigmentary changes from a hereditary retinopathy. In &#173;these cases, although the rod and cone amplitudes are reduced, the implicit times are usually within normal ranges, &#173;because the remaining photoreceptors are essentially normal. In contrast, in patients with a hereditary retinopathy, the remaining photoreceptors are impaired by the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic condition and the ERG response shows prolonged implicit times. In <span class="italic">conventional testing</span> of many rod–&#173;cone dystrophies, the ERG responses may initially pres&#173;ent as undetectable or become undetectable over time. An undetectable ERG signal is not diagnostic; while it represents severe ret&#173;i&#173;nal dysfunction, it &#173;doesn’t necessarily correlate to the patient’s level of visual function. &#173;Unless the patient has a treatable condition, such as vitamin A deficiency or an autoimmune retinopathy, repetitive ERG testing has minimal benefit for monitoring disease progression.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Sectorial RP</span> refers to disease that involves only 1 or 2&#160;sectors of the fundus. This condition is generally symmetric in both eyes, which helps rule out acquired damage (eg, from trauma, vascular insult, or inflammation) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-6</span>). <span class="italic">Unilateral RP</span> is extremely rare; &#173;there has only been a single reported case within a &#173;family with a germline mutation. Most cases of unexplained unilateral pigmentary retinopathy are postinflammatory or posttraumatic. Most cases of <span class="italic">pigmented paravenous retinopathy</span> are postinflammatory, have interocular asymmetry, and are usually nonprogressive.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When evaluating suspected panret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophy in a patient with a negative &#173;family history <span class="italic">(sporadic ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophy),</span> it is impor&#173;tant to consider acquired &#173;causes of ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration that can mimic hereditary conditions, including previous bilateral ophthalmic artery occlusions, diffuse uveitis, infections (eg, syphilis), paraneoplastic syndromes, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal drug toxicity. Syndromic forms of pigmentary retinopathy associated with metabolic or other organ system disease must also be considered (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span>). Age of onset, pattern of progression, interocular asymmetry, and comorbidities and exposures can help to distinguish &#173;these conditions.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Management</span> Nutritional supplements have been advocated as therapy for RP. One large study reported that high daily doses of vitamin A palmitate (15,000&#160;IU/day) can slow the decline in ERG response and visual fields in eyes with RP by approximately 20% per year. A slight benefit from omega-3 and omega-6 fatty-&#173;acid supplementation has also been reported. The modest benefit of high-&#173;dose vitamin A supplementation must be weighed against the risks of long-&#173;term liver toxicity, vitamin A-&#173;related intracranial hypertension, and teratogenicity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Excessive light exposure may play a role in ret&#173;i&#173;nal degenerations caused by rhodopsin mutations and/or genes that contribute to lipofuscin accumulation, such as <span class="italic">ABCA4</span>. Recommendations for patients to employ UV-&#173;absorbing sunglasses and brimmed hats for protection from high levels of light exposure seem prudent, despite the absence of direct evidence of benefit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Efforts to restore at least some vision in patients rendered completely blind from RP include the use of electronic chips that interface with the remaining ret&#173;ina tissue. One such device, the Argus II Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Prosthesis System (Second Sight Medical Products, Sylmar, California), is now commercially available, and &#173;others are in development.</p>

			<p class="h3">Cone and cone–&#173;rod dystrophies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with cone dystrophy pres&#173;ent with progressive loss of visual acuity and color discrimination, often accompanied by hemeralopia (day blindness) and photophobia (discomfort and/or pain in the presence of normal levels of light). Onset of symptoms typically occurs in the teenage years or &#173;later adulthood. Ophthalmoscopy may be normal early in the course of the disease. &#173;Because of this, patients with cone dystrophies may be suspected of malingering. In other patients, ophthalmoscopy may reveal the typical symmetric bull’s-&#173;eye pattern of macular atrophy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-7</span>), or more severe atrophy, such as demarcated circular macular lesions. Mild to severe temporal optic atrophy and tapetal ret&#173;i&#173;nal reflexes (with a glistening greenish or golden sheen) may also be pres&#173;ent. Unlike macular dystrophies, the cone dystrophies are more associated with color discrimination symptoms and photophobia, and as such, they must be differentiated from color vision defects (see Chapter&#160;12).</p>
			<p class="body-text">When cone dystrophy is suspected, a full-&#173;field ERG is the appropriate test. Cone dystrophies are diagnosed when ERG results indicate an abnormal or undetectable photopic ERG response and a normal or near-&#173;normal rod-&#173;isolated ERG response. When pres&#173;ent, the cone flicker ERG response is almost invariably delayed, in keeping with generalized cone-&#173;system dysfunction. Peripheral visual fields may remain normal. The cone dystrophies are progressive and are a heterogeneous group of hereditary diseases with more than 25 identified causative genes. In some patients, secondary rod photoreceptor involvement develops in &#173;later life, leading to overlap between progressive cone dystrophies and cone–&#173;rod dystrophies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Similar to patients with cone dystrophies, patients with <span class="italic">cone–&#173;rod dystrophies</span> typically pres&#173;ent with reduced central visual acuities and symptoms of dyschromatopsia and photophobia. On <span class="italic">visual field testing,</span> some patients show a tight ring or central scotoma within the central 20° or 30° of the visual field. Ophthalmoscopy may initially be normal; &#173;later, it may demonstrate intraret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment in areas of ret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy in the fundus periphery, and patients may report progressive night blindness. The diagnostic hallmark of a cone–&#173;rod dystrophy is that the cone-&#173;derived full-&#173;field ERG responses are more abnormal than the rod ERG responses.</p>
			<p class="h3">Leber congenital amaurosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The early-&#173;onset ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies are collectively termed <span class="italic">Leber congenital amaurosis</span> (LCA) (also see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> Chapter&#160;25). LCA is characterized by severely reduced vision from birth, usually associated with wandering nystagmus. Infants exhibit limited to absolutely no visual responses, and visual acuities tend to range between 20/200 to no light perception (NLP). Some infants with LCA rub or poke their eyes (the <span class="italic">oculodigital reflex</span>) to create visual stimulation, as do other infants with poor vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the early stages, obvious fundus changes are rare, and molecular ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing offers the best method of distinguishing stationary and progressive hereditary retinopathies. In addition, &#173;because &#173;there are both syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of LCA, a molecular ge&#173;ne&#173;tic diagnosis can help identify potential systemic features that warrant medical management. Some forms of LCA involve developmental defects, while &#173;others appear to represent degenerations of normally formed ret&#173;ina. Postinfectious etiologies should be considered based on clinical history and clinical findings. Central macular atrophic lesions (sometimes incorrectly referred to as macular colobomas) are often seen in eyes with LCA, in addition to early-&#173;onset cataracts and keratoconus in older &#173;children. Most &#173;children with nonsyndromic LCA have normal intelligence, and some of the observed psychomotor impairment may be secondary to sensory deprivation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ERG response is typically minimal or undetectable, but ERG testing is not able to establish &#173;whether the condition is stationary (congenital stationary night blindness [CSNB] or achromatopsia) or progressive (rod–&#173;cone dystrophy or cone–&#173;rod dystrophy). OCT can help identify &#173;whether the failure of foveal maturation that is associated with ocular albinism and is also detected in dystrophy-&#173;related macular edema is pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Currently, 3 autosomal dominant and 18 recessive mutations that cause LCA have been identified. &#173;There is some overlap in the genes responsible for LCA and &#173;those that cause later-&#173;onset ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies (both rod–&#173;cone and cone–&#173;rod). One form of LCA bearing a mutation in <span class="italic">RPE65</span> has been treated successfully by gene therapy in clinical &#173;trials using an adeno-&#173;associated virus. In 2018, <span class="xref-table">the FDA issued the first approval for a gene </span><span class="xref-table">therapy, Luxturna, for the treatment of this condition in individuals aged 1 year or older.</span></p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Enhanced S-&#173;cone disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most prominent features of enhanced S-&#173;cone (or blue-&#173;cone; “S” refers to short wavelength) disease (ESCD), also known as Goldmann-&#173;Favre syndrome, include night blindness, increased sensitivity to blue light, pigmentary ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration, an optically empty vitreous, hyperopia, pathognomonic ERG abnormalities, and varying degrees of peripheral to midperipheral visual field loss (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-8</span>). The posterior pole may show round, yellow, sheenlike lesions along the arcades, accompanied by areas of diffuse degeneration. Deep nummular pigmentary deposition is usually observed at the level of the RPE around the vascular arcades. Macular (and sometimes peripheral) schisis may be pres&#173;ent, overlapping the phenotype of X-&#173;linked retinoschisis. The ERG response includes no detectable dim-&#173;flash, rod-&#173;specific signal; delayed and simplified responses to a brighter flash that have the same waveform &#173;under both dark-&#173;adapted and light-&#173;adapted conditions; and a flicker ERG response of lower amplitude than that of the single-&#173;flash photopic a-&#173;wave.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In eyes with ESCD &#173;there is an overabundance of blue cones, a reduced number of red and green cones, and few, if any, functional rods. This condition is unique in that it is both a developmental and degenerative photoreceptor retinopathy.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Widespread primary ret&#173;i&#173;nal or RPE disease that &#173;causes advanced atrophy of the choriocapillaris occurs in choroideremia, gyrate atrophy, Bietti crystalline dystrophy, and phenothiazine-&#173;related ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxicity (see also Chapter&#160;15). In fundus autofluorescence imaging, hypoautofluorescence in the areas of atrophy is typically observed in all of &#173;these conditions and is therefore helpful for monitoring the disease progression.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Choroideremia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with choroideremia have night blindness and show progressive peripheral visual field loss over 3–5 de&#173;cades. Most patients maintain good visual acuity &#173;until a central island of foveal vision is lost. The degeneration initially manifests as mottled areas of pigmentation in the anterior equatorial region and macula. The anterior areas gradually degenerate to confluent scalloped areas of RPE and choriocapillaris loss; larger choroidal vessels are preserved (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-9</span>). Furthermore, the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels appear normal, and &#173;there is no optic atrophy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">On fluorescein angiography imaging, the changes are pronounced: the scalloped areas of missing choriocapillaris appear hypofluorescent next to brightly hyperfluorescent areas of perfused choriocapillaris with intact overlying RPE. Fundus autofluorescence imaging shows a characteristic speckled pattern of autofluorescence in the nonatrophic areas. The ERG response is abnormal early in the course of the disease and is generally extinguished by midlife. &#173;Because phenotypes can overlap with other conditions, especially other choroidal dystrophies, the clinical and imaging features should not be considered pathognomonic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Choroideremia is X-&#173;linked and caused by mutations in <span class="italic">CHM,</span> which is constitutively expressed and encodes geranylgeranyl transferase Rab escort protein. Carriers of choroideremia are usually asymptomatic and have normal ERGs. However, they often show patches of subret&#173;i&#173;nal black mottled pigment, and on occasion, older female carriers show a lobular pattern of choriocapillaris and RPE loss. Gene-&#173;therapy &#173;trials for choroideremia are ongoing.</p>

			<p class="h3">Gyrate atrophy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients affected by <span class="italic">gyrate atrophy</span> usually develop night blindness during the first de&#173;cade of life, and experience progressive loss of visual field and visual acuity &#173;later in the course&#160;of the disease. Macular edema is commonly pres&#173;ent. In the early stages of the disease, patients have large, geographic, peripheral paving-&#173;stone–&#173;like areas of atrophy of the RPE and choriocapillaris, which gradually coalesce to form a characteristic scalloped border at the junction of normal and abnormal RPE (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-10</span>). Gyrate atrophy is an autosomal recessive dystrophy caused by mutations in the gene for ornithine aminotransferase <span class="italic">(OAT)</span>. The diagnosis is supported by elevated plasma levels of ornithine. If started at a young age, aggressive dietary restriction of arginine intake and, in some cases, vitamin B6 supplementation can slow or halt progression of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration. The clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing elevated serum or plasma ornithine levels as well as by ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing for mutations of <span class="italic">OAT.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Bietti crystalline dystrophy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Individuals with Bietti crystalline dystrophy develop symptoms of nyctalopia, decreased vision, and paracentral scotomas in the second to fourth de&#173;cades. On examination, intraret&#173;i&#173;nal yellow-&#173;white crystals are vis&#173;i&#173;ble in the posterior ret&#173;ina and in the peripheral cornea near the limbus. As the disease progresses, widespread retinochoroidal atrophy develops and peripheral vision worsens. In eyes with advanced disease, the intraret&#173;i&#173;nal crystals may not be evident. This condition is a very rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene <span class="italic">CYP4V2</span>. &#173;There is no known treatment.</p>

			<div id="Chapt13_Top6">
			<p class="h2-h1">Stargardt Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Stargardt disease is the most common juvenile macular dystrophy and a common cause of central vision loss in adults younger than 50&#160;years. The visual acuity in Stargardt disease typically ranges from 20/50 to 20/200.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The classic Stargardt phenotype is characterized by a juvenile-&#173;onset foveal atrophy surrounded by discrete, yellowish, round or pisciform flecks at the level of the RPE (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-11A</span>). If the flecks are widely scattered throughout the fundus with central sparing, the condition, which used to be referred to as <span class="italic">fundus flavimaculatus,</span> is now known to result from mutations in the same genes and can be pres&#173;ent in families with the classic Stargardt phenotype. On fluorescein angiography, 80% or more of patients with Stargardt disease have a “dark choroid,” or, in other words, blocking of choroidal fluorescence that highlights the ret&#173;i&#173;nal circulation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-11B</span>). Fundus autofluorescence imaging is a more reliable means of demonstrating elevated background autofluorescence and characteristic findings, including peripapillary sparing of the RPE changes, central macular hypoautofluorescence, and, over time, an outward expanding pattern of hyperautofluorescent flecks, which leave hypoautofluorescent areas in their wake. Full-&#173;field ERGs are not diagnostic for this condition; however, individuals with significantly abnormal responses generally have more severe and progressive disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The age of onset and pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of the clinical features in Stargardt disease varies, sometimes even among individuals within the same &#173;family. The condition is usually slowly progressive with the accumulation of lipofuscin-&#173;like material in the RPE (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-</span><span class="xref-figure">12</span>). Once the central vision is involved, the loss of visual acuity can be relatively rapid, over months to a few years, and then plateaus. However, if the central fovea area is spared, it is not unusual for a patient to be unaware that they are affected &#173;until adulthood. In &#173;later stages, atrophic maculopathy, with or without lipofuscin flecks and panret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration, can be observed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The majority of cases of Stargardt disease are autosomal recessive and are due to mutations in the <span class="italic">ABCA4</span> gene. However, autosomal dominant transmission patterns can result from mutations in other genes, most notably <span class="italic">PRPH2</span>. The <span class="italic">ABCA4</span> gene encodes an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-&#173;binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein expressed by rod outer segments and RPE. See &#173;<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;13-1</span> for a list of additional ge&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;causes. Based on animal models of <span class="italic">ABCA4</span>-&#173;related disease, vitamin A supplementation accelerates the accumulation of lipofuscin pigments in the RPE and, in conjunction with blue light, also accelerates ret&#173;i&#173;nal cell death. Drug therapies to reduce lipofuscin accumulation, gene therapies, and stem cell treatments are currently undergoing clinical &#173;trials.</p>
			<p class="h2">Best Disease or Best Vitelliform Dystrophy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Individuals affected by Best disease frequently develop a yellow, egg yolk–&#173;like (vitelliform) macular lesion in childhood, which eventually breaks down, leaving a mottled geographic atrophic appearance (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-13</span>). Late in the course of the disease, the geographic atrophy may be difficult to distinguish from other types of macular degeneration or dystrophy. Some patients (up to 30% in some series) have extrafoveal vitelliform lesions in the fundus. The macular appearance in all stages is deceptive, as most patients maintain relatively good visual acuity throughout the course of the disease. Even patients with “scrambled-&#173;egg” macular lesions typically have visual acuities from 20/30 to 20/60. In approximately 20% of patients, a choroidal neovascular membrane develops in at least 1 eye during the course of the disease and, if untreated, may result in poor vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ERG response is characteristically normal, but the electro-&#173;oculogram (EOG) result is almost always abnormal, even in “unaffected,” asymptomatic individuals who have the causative ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variant but have normal-&#173;appearing fundi. The light rise of the EOG (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;3</span>) is typically severely reduced or absent. Before ordering an EOG to rule out Best disease, clinicians should ensure that the full-&#173;field ERG is normal. Molecular ge&#173;ne&#173;tic studies are more sensitive in detecting carriers than electrophysiologic testing is. In addition to incomplete penetrance, &#173;there is also variable expressivity, and some cases may show multifocal vitelliform lesions rather than a single subfoveal lesion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Best disease is an autosomal dominant maculopathy caused by mutations in the <span class="italic">BES</span><span class="italic">T1</span> gene (<span class="italic">VMD2</span>). The encoded protein bestrophin localizes to the basolateral plasma membrane of the RPE and functions as a transmembrane ion channel. Although some <span class="italic">BEST1</span> variants &#173;will cause autosomal dominant disease, other mutations, when pres&#173;ent as homozygous or compound heterozygous variants, can give rise to autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB). Unlike Best disease, ARB is associated with progressive ret&#173;i&#173;nal dysfunction on the full-&#173;field ERG, loss of visual acuity, diffuse irregularity of the RPE, and dispersed punctate flecks, which are distinct from extramacular vitelliform lesions.</p>

			<p class="h2">Adult-&#173;Onset Vitelliform Lesions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several types of symmetric yellow deposits that resemble Best disease may develop in the macula of older adults. The most common disorder, <span class="italic">adult-&#173;onset foveomacular vitelliform dystrophy,</span> is one of the <span class="italic">pattern dystrophies</span> (discussed &#173;later in this chapter). It is characterized by yellow subfoveal lesions that are bilateral, round or oval, and typically one-&#173;third disc dia&#173;meter in size; they often contain a central pigmented spot (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-14</span>). Occasionally, when the lesions are larger, they may be misdiagnosed as Best disease or even as age-&#173;related macular degeneration (AMD). This dystrophy generally appears in the fourth to sixth de&#173;cades in patients who &#173;either are visually asymptomatic or have mild blurring and metamorphopsia. Eventually, the lesions may fade, leaving an area of RPE atrophy, but most patients retain reading vision in at least 1 eye throughout their lives. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been recognized in some affected families. The most common causative gene is <span class="italic">PRPH2,</span> and &#173;there is evidence of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic heterogeneity for this phenotype. In some cases of post-&#173;surgical CME, acute onset of foveomacular subret&#173;i&#173;nal deposits in the absence of drusen or intraret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid have been seen; &#173;these respond well to standard therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with numerous basal laminar (cuticular) drusen may develop an unusual <span class="italic">vitelliform exudative macular detachment</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-15</span>). The yellowish subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid blocks background fluorescence early, often stains late in the angiogram study, and may be mistaken for choroidal neovascularization. Patients with yellowish macular detachments often maintain good visual acuity for many months but may eventually lose central vision &#173;because of geographic atrophy or choroidal neovascularization and disciform scarring.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some patients with large, soft drusen, &#173;there is a large, central coalescence of drusen, or <span class="italic">drusenoid RPE detachment,</span> which may occasionally mimic a macular vitelliform lesion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-16</span>). Such lesions often have pigment mottling on their surface and are surrounded by numerous other individual or confluent soft drusen. They may remain stable (and allow for good vision) for many years, but eventually they tend to flatten and evolve into geographic atrophy.</p>
			<p class="h2">Early-&#173;Onset “Drusenoid” Macular Dystrophies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Early-&#173;onset drusen typically manifests at younger ages than do drusen in most cases of AMD. Though they are frequently referred to as “familial or autosomal dominant drusen,” the clinician needs to establish &#173;whether other &#173;family members are affected before assuming an inheritance pattern. In addition, although early-&#173;onset drusen are presumed to be genet&#173;ically determined, the inheritance pattern in the majority of young patients is never established; many cases may be multigenic and related to the same pathways that give rise to AMD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Drusen are usually numerous and vary in size, typically extending beyond the vascular arcades and nasal to the optic nerve head (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-17</span>). Early-&#173;onset drusen have been classified into 3 entities: (1) large colloid drusen, (2) Malattia Leventinese, and (3) cuticular drusen (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-18</span>). On fundus examination, <span class="italic">large colloid drusen</span> appear as large, yellowish, and bilateral lesions located in the macula and/or the periphery of the ret&#173;ina. The vitelliform lesions are hyperautofluorescent and are thought to be made up of lipofuscin, while the associated surrounding cuticular drusen and/or subret&#173;i&#173;nal drusenoid deposits are generally not autofluorescent. <span class="italic">Malattia Leventinese</span> and <span class="italic">Doyne honeycomb dystrophy</span> are essentially the same condition and often show a distinctive pattern of radial extensions of small and intermediate-&#173;sized deposits emanating from the fovea. The condition is caused by a shared single autosomal dominant mutation in the gene <span class="italic">EFEMP1</span>, which to date has not been associated with AMD risk. However, the causative genes in several juvenile and early-&#173;onset macular dystrophies are the same as the genes that have been implicated in the complex ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorder of AMD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sorsby macular dystrophy (SMD), a dominantly inherited disease resulting from <span class="italic">TIMP3</span> mutations, involves the development of bilateral, subfoveal, choroidal neovascular lesions at approximately 40&#160;years of age (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-19</span>). As the macular lesions evolve, they take on the appearance of geographic atrophy, with pronounced clumps of black pigmentation around the central ischemic and atrophic zone (a pseudoinflammatory appearance). An early sign of the disease is the presence of numerous fine drusenlike deposits or a confluent plaque of faintly yellow material beneath the RPE of the posterior pole. Both common and rare variants of <span class="italic">TIMP3</span> have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD. Other drusenlike deposits that manifest before age 50 include &#173;those associated with several hereditary basement membrane abnormalities that lead to significant renal disease, including Alport syndrome, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type&#160;II, and aty&#173;pi&#173;cal hemolytic uremia syndromes. Recognition of &#173;these conditions and confirmation with molecular ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing is critical &#173;because of the initial occult nature of the renal disease, which can be life-&#173;threatening. The genes known to lead to &#173;these Mendelian disorders are also implicated in the causation of AMD.</p>
			<p class="h2">Pattern Dystrophies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The pattern dystrophies are a group of disorders characterized by the development, typically in midlife, of vari&#173;ous patterns of yellow, orange, or gray pigment deposition at the level of the RPE in the macular area. &#173;These dystrophies may be subdivided into 4 major patterns according to the distribution of pigment deposits: (1) adult-&#173;onset foveomacular vitelliform dystrophy (discussed earlier in this chapter), (2) butterfly-&#173;type pattern dystrophy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-20</span>), (3) reticular-&#173;type pattern dystrophy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-21</span>), and (4) fundus pulverulentus (coarse pigment mottling). Patients are often asymptomatic. The most common presenting symptom of the pattern dystrophies is diminished visual acuity or mild metamorphopsia. The risk of developing choroidal neovascularization is low, but geographic macular atrophy may eventually develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The inheritance is often autosomal dominant, but other modes of inheritance have been observed, including autosomal recessive and mitochondrial. The majority of the cases of autosomal dominant pattern dystrophy have been associated with mutations in <span class="italic">PRPH2,</span> but other genes and conditions can give rise to similar phenotypes, including pseudoxanthoma elasticum and some mitochondrial disorders.</p>
			<p class="h2">Aty&#173;pi&#173;cal and “Occult” Macular Dystrophies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Aty&#173;pi&#173;cal macular dystrophies include <span class="italic">central areolar choroidal dystrophy</span> for which <span class="italic">PRPH2, GUCY2D,</span> and 2 other ge&#173;ne&#173;tic loci have been implicated in autosomal dominant inheritance (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-22</span>). <span class="italic">North Carolina macular dystrophy</span> is an autosomal dominant, completely penetrant congenital and stationary maldevelopment of the macula. &#173;There is very large phenotypic variability with 3 grades of severity: grade 1, drusen; grade 2, confluent drusen; and grade 3, colobomatous-&#173;like excavated defects in the macula that sometimes resemble toxoplasmosis. (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-23</span>). The visual acuity in eyes with North Carolina macular dystrophy can be surprisingly good, given the appearance of the macula. However, choroidal neovascularization and fibrosis can develop, resulting in visual acuity deterioration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although many of the macular dystrophies result in abnormal RPE pigmentation and/or accumulation of lipofuscin or drusenlike deposits, some forms of macular dystrophy, often referred to as <span class="italic">occult macular dystrophy,</span> do not have &#173;these associated findings. &#173;These patients frequently pres&#173;ent with seemingly unexplained loss of central vision. ERG testing is uninformative in &#173;these cases, and the most striking clinical findings are disruption (&#173;either discrete or diffuse) of the central ellipsoid layer on OCT. The differential diagnosis can include <span class="italic">solar retinopathy</span> as well as <span class="italic">early macular telangiectasia</span> (which itself may be a type of polygenic macular dystrophy) and <span class="italic">acute macular neuroretinopathy</span> (&#173;either unilateral or bilateral). Mutations in <span class="italic">RP1L1</span> and <span class="italic">MFSD8</span> have been reported to give rise to this phenotype.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Inner Retinal Dystrophies</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top7">
			<p class="h2-h1">X-Linked Retinoschisis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retinoschisis refers to a splitting of the neurosensory ret&#173;ina. The phenotype of congenital X-&#173;linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is variable, even within families. In pediatric patients, foveal schisis, which appears as small, cystoid spaces and fine radial striae in the central macula (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-24</span>), can be best seen with OCT and fundus autofluorescence imaging. Other presenting signs include parafoveal white dots. Schisis is occasionally absent on OCT imaging, even in molecularly confirmed disease. Central vision may initially be quite good and may remain stable for long periods but can eventually decline to 20/200 or worse.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Peripheral retinoschisis may occur in up to 50% of patients. In severe cases involving peripheral schisis, &#173;there may be extensive areas of inner ret&#173;i&#173;nal elevation resembling total or subtotal ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Histologic studies have shown that the splitting in peripheral XLRS occurs in the outer plexiform and nerve fiber layers. Pigmentary deposits may develop in peripheral areas destroyed by the disease pro&#173;cess, so advanced cases of XLRS may be mistaken for RP. Boys with XLRS frequently pres&#173;ent with vitreous hemorrhages from torn ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels in areas of retinoschisis. Areas of peripheral schisis and the associated absolute scotomas are best monitored by widefield perimetry (eg, HVF 60-4) &#173;because photographic documentation can be extremely difficult.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The panret&#173;i&#173;nal involvement and inner ret&#173;i&#173;nal location of the disease are reflected in the ERG response, which has a negative waveform in which the a-&#173;wave is normal or near normal, but the b-&#173;wave is reduced (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;3, Fig 3-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In XLRS, the gene <span class="italic">RS1</span> encodes an adhesion protein called <span class="italic">retinoschisin,</span> which is crucial for the structural integrity of the ret&#173;ina provided by the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells. Treatment with topical and/or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be effective in reducing the intraret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid in the central schisis cavities and may help to preserve long-&#173;term central vision function. A clinical trial of a gene therapy for this condition was initiated in 2016.</p>
