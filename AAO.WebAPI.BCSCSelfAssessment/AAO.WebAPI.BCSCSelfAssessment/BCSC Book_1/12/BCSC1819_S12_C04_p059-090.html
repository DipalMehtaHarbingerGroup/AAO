			<p class="h1">Age-Related Macular Degeneration</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Age-&#173;related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world in &#173;people over 50&#160;years. It is estimated that among North Americans, 11&#160;million (85%–90% of all AMD patients) currently have “dry” (nonneovascular, or nonexudative) AMD and 1.5 million &#173;people (10%–15% of all AMD patients) have “wet” (neovascular) AMD. An estimated 71,000 new cases of neovascular AMD develop each year in North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Normal aging results in a spectrum of changes in the macula, many clinically undetected, that affect the outer ret&#173;ina, ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE), Bruch membrane, and choriocapillaris:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Photoreceptors are reduced in density and distribution.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Ultrastructural changes in the pigment epithelium include loss of melanin granules, formation of lipofuscin granules, and accumulation of residual bodies.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Basal laminar/linear deposits accumulate; &#173;these deposits consist of granular, lipid-&#173;rich material and widely spaced collagen fibers collecting between the plasma membrane of the RPE cell and the inner collagenous layer of Bruch membrane on &#173;either side of the basement membrane of the RPE (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-1</span>; discussed &#173;later in the chapter).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">Progressive involutional changes occur in the choriocapillaris.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All of &#173;these changes represent aging and may not be part of AMD. Abnormalities associated with AMD that are not necessarily part of normal aging may be classified as nonneovascular or neovascular.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Population-&#173;based studies have demonstrated that of the risk &#173;factors for AMD, age is the first and foremost; in resource-&#173;rich countries, 10% of &#173;people over the age of 65&#160;years and 25% over the age of 75&#160;years have AMD. Additional risk &#173;factors include female sex, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease, higher waist-&#173;to-&#173;hip ratio in men, positive &#173;family history, cigarette smoking, elevated levels of C-&#173;reactive protein and other inflammatory markers, hyperopia, and light iris color. Of modifiable risk &#173;factors, cigarette smoking has been consistently demonstrated to be most significant. Racial origin is another impor&#173;tant risk &#173;factor. The 10-&#173;year longitudinal Multi-&#173;Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) found that the prevalence of AMD was highest in whites (5.4%) and lowest in African Americans (2.4%); prevalence was intermediate in Hispanics (4.2%) and Asians (4.6%).</p>

			<p class="h2">Genetics and AMD</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The etiology of AMD remains poorly understood. Development of the disorder involves interplay between ge&#173;ne&#173;tic predisposition and other risk &#173;factors. A recent genome-&#173;wide association study of 43,000 &#173;people identified 52 ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variants, both common and rare, located on the 34 loci associated with AMD. &#173;These genes harbor mutations that affect vari&#173;ous biochemical pathways, including the complement cascade, lipid transport and metabolism (eg, <span class="italic">APOE</span>), modulation of the extracellular collagen matrix (eg, <span class="italic">COL8A1, COL10A1, TIMP3</span>), clearance of all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans</span>-&#173;retinaldehyde from photoreceptors <span class="italic">(ABCA4),</span> and angiogenesis (eg, <span class="italic">MMP9, VEGFA</span>). The alternate complement pathway includes the highest number of known AMD risk alleles, including <span class="italic">CFH, CFI, C2/CFB, C3,</span> and <span class="italic">C7.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">The 2 major susceptibility genes for AMD are <span class="italic">CFH</span> (1q31), which codes for complement &#173;factor H, and <span class="italic">ARMS2</span> (10q26), for which the gene product and function are poorly understood. <span class="italic">ARMS2/HTRA1</span> and <span class="italic">MMP20</span> are associated with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesion size. The <span class="italic">CFH</span> Y402H mutation confers a 4.6-&#173;fold increased risk for AMD when heterozygous and a 7.4-&#173;fold increased risk when homozygous. The <span class="italic">ARMS2</span> A69S mutation confers a 2.7-&#173;fold increased risk for AMD when heterozygous and an 8.2-&#173;fold increased risk when homozygous. When both genes are homozygous for the aforementioned mutations in an individual, the risk for AMD is increased to 50-&#173;fold.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Genetic testing is available for AMD and usually includes testing for many of the known risk alleles. However, the interpretation and usefulness of the results remain controversial, &#173;because unhealthy lifestyles increase AMD risk regardless of the AMD risk genotype. The risk models used &#173;either are poorly validated or add &#173;little information to the risks that can already be estimated from clinical findings and assessment of the patient’s risk &#173;factors (eg, smoking history, &#173;family history). The American Acad&#173;emy of Ophthalmology’s official recommendation is to defer ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing for complex disorders such as AMD &#173;until replicable studies have confirmed the value of such testing for prognostication or response to therapy. Pharmacogenomic testing is also pos&#173;si&#173;ble; it aims to predict the optimal pharmacologic or nutritional-&#173;supplement interventions for a given patient. Evidence to support this approach is only beginning to emerge, and validation studies are lacking. However, this is a fast-&#173;moving area of research, and progression to useful testing is likely.</p>

			<p class="h2">Nonneovascular AMD</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The defining lesion of the nonneovascular form of AMD is the druse. Other indicators are abnormalities of the RPE, including hyperpigmentation and atrophy.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Drusen</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinically, drusen are small, round, yellow lesions located along the basal surface of the RPE, mostly in the postequatorial ret&#173;ina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">2</span>). Histologically, this material corresponds to the abnormal thickening of the inner aspect of Bruch membrane shown in Figure&#160;4-1. Ultrastructurally, basal <span class="italic">laminar</span> deposits (granular, lipid-&#173;rich material and widely spaced collagen fibers between the plasma membrane and basement membrane of the RPE cell) and basal <span class="italic">linear</span> deposits (phospholipid vesicles and electron-&#173;dense granules <span class="italic">within</span> the inner collagenous zone of Bruch membrane) are pres&#173;ent (see Fig 4-1).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The thickened inner aspect of Bruch membrane, along with the RPE, may separate from the rest of Bruch membrane, resulting in pigment epithelial detachment (PED). When small, such a detachment may be identified as a large or soft druse, and when larger, it may be recognized as a drusenoid PED.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because drusen variably affect the overlying photoreceptors, &#173;there may be associated mild to moderate vision loss, decreased contrast sensitivity and color vision, and impairment of dark adaptation. Increasing size, number, and confluence of the drusen confer increasing risk of progression to CNV or geographic atrophy (GA), which the Age-&#173;Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) referred to as stage 4 or the advanced stage of AMD. Drusen are categorized by size as small (usually <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>63 µm dia&#173;meter), intermediate (usually 63–124 µm), or large (usually <span class="symbol">≥</span>125 µm). <span class="italic">Drusenoid PEDs</span> are confluent large drusen that coalesce into a PED (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>350 µm dia&#173;meter). In AREDS, the risk of progression to stage 4 AMD over a 5-&#173;year period for patients with early AMD (many small drusen or few intermediate drusen, stage 2) was 1.3%. In contrast, the risk for patients with many intermediate drusen or even a single large druse (stage 3) was 18%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Drusen can be further distinguished by their bound&#173;aries: hard (discrete and well demarcated), soft (amorphous and poorly demarcated; see Fig 4-2A, B), or confluent (contiguous drusen without clear bound&#173;aries; see Fig 4-2C). Hard drusen are well-&#173;defined focal areas of lipidization or hyalinization of the RPE–&#173;Bruch membrane complex. Soft drusen are associated with the presence of diffuse thickening of the inner aspects of Bruch membrane, that is, basal linear deposits. An eye with soft, and perhaps confluent, drusen is more likely to pro&#173;gress to atrophy or CNV than an eye with only hard drusen.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Reticular pseudodrusen</span> or <span class="italic">subret&#173;i&#173;nal drusenoid deposits</span> are similar in appearance to drusen; they can be recognized by their reticular-&#173;like network, seen best on fundus autofluorescence (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">3</span>). &#173;These lesions are typically smaller than soft drusen, are located on the apical surface of the RPE, and commonly distribute in the superior macular region. Although they share some proteins with drusen (eg, apolipoprotein E, complement &#173;factor H, and vitronectin), they contain dif&#173;fer&#173;ent lipids and do not contain shed disk remnants. Their presence has been associated with progressive atrophy of the photoreceptor layer, GA, and a greater risk of CNV.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Drusen occurring in patients younger than 50&#160;years are discussed in the section “Early-onset ‘drusenoid’ macular dystrophies” in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span>.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Fluorescein angiography of drusen</span> Drusen appearance on fluorescein angiography (FA) can vary. Typically, small hard drusen hyperfluoresce early in FA studies &#173;because of a win&#173;dow defect, whereas larger soft and confluent drusen and drusenoid PEDs slowly and homo&#173;genously stain late &#173;because of pooling of the fluorescein dye in the sub-&#173;PED compartment. </p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Optical coherence tomography of drusen</span> Spectral-&#173;domain optical coherence tomography (SD-&#173;OCT) imaging of small and large drusen typically reveals sub-&#173;RPE nodular elevations or even small RPE detachments with a notable absence of intraret&#173;i&#173;nal and subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid (see Fig 4-2). Reticular pseudodrusen are identified above the RPE and beneath the inner segment ellipsoid layer and are graded according to their degree of elevation (see Fig 4-3).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Enhanced depth imaging (EDI) OCT provides more details of choroidal architecture and a clearer definition of the choroidal-&#173;scleral interface, which is helpful in characterizing AMD. Choroidal thickness is often reduced in AMD.</p>
			<p class="h3">Abnormalities of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Characteristic RPE abnormalities seen in patients with nonneovascular AMD include focal hyperpigmentation, focal atrophy, and geographic atrophy. Focal RPE hyperpigmentation appears as increased pigmentation at the level of the outer ret&#173;ina. &#173;These areas typically produce blockage of fluorescence on FA, and appear as hyperreflective outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal foci on SD-&#173;OCT. The incidence of focal hyperpigmentations increases with age; their presence is associated with a greater risk of progression to the more advanced forms of AMD.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Focal atrophy</span> appears as noncontiguous areas of pigment mottling or frank depigmentation. If such lesions are contiguous and have a dia&#173;meter greater than 175 <span class="greek CharOverride-2">μ</span>m, they are described as <span class="italic">geographic atrophy</span> <span class="italic">(GA)</span> of the RPE. In areas of GA, absence or depigmentation of the RPE unmasks the choroidal vessels, making them vis&#173;i&#173;ble. The overlying outer ret&#173;ina typically appears thin, and the under&#173;lying choriocapillaris is attenuated or atrophied. On FA, GA appears as well-&#173;circumscribed round to oval win&#173;dow defects; SD-&#173;OCT reveals the progressive loss of RPE, the overlying inner segment ellipsoid, and the photoreceptor layers. Areas of GA are densely hypoautofluorescent, making fundus autofluorescence a useful, noninvasive technique for monitoring disease progression (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">4</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Geographic atrophy often spares the fovea &#173;until late in the course of the disease. It may first pres&#173;ent as 1 or more noncontiguous patches of atrophy around the fovea. &#173;These patches enlarge and coalesce, leaving the affected individual with dense paracentral scotomas, which can limit tasks such as reading. The rate of disease progression has been estimated at 1.79&#160;mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>/year, but this may vary from individual to individual. Patients with GA may demonstrate good visual acuity (VA) &#173;until late in the disease, when the fovea becomes involved and VA declines due to central blindness, forcing the patient to use eccentric fixation on noncentral ret&#173;ina to read and perform other visual tasks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although not all eyes with drusen or drusenoid PED &#173;will develop atrophy, the incidence of atrophy appears to increase with age. Twelve to 20% of patients with GA experience severe vision loss, and 10% of patients with AMD and a VA of 20/200 or less have GA. Decreased contrast sensitivity and reduction in microperimetry sensitivity values reflect the presence of pseudodrusen prior to progression to GA.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Other abnormalities</span> Chronic nonneovascular AMD can lead to progressive RPE atrophy and GA. As drusen resorb over time, atrophy of the RPE often remains. Dystrophic lipidization and calcification (“refractile” or “calcific” drusen) may occur, resulting in the development of refractile or crystalline lesions in the macula. Furthermore, pigment or pigment-&#173;laden cells (&#173;either RPE cells or macrophages that have ingested the pigment) may migrate to the photoreceptor level, resulting in focal clumps or a reticulated pattern of hyperpigmentation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Differential diagnosis of nonneovascular AMD</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Disorders that include RPE abnormalities may be misinterpreted as nonneovascular AMD. Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC; discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;9</span>) may produce RPE changes similar to &#173;those in AMD. In patients with CSC, EDI-&#173;OCT reveals a thickened choroid in the affected and fellow eyes, as opposed to the normal or thin choroid in eyes with AMD. Pattern dystrophies of the RPE pres&#173;ent as areas of reticular or butterfly-&#173;shaped hyperpigmentation of the macula, which are often symmetrical in each eye. Patients with adult-&#173;onset vitelliform maculopathy may pres&#173;ent with yellow subret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions beneath the outer ret&#173;ina. On SD-&#173;OCT this condition appears as a hyperreflective, dome-&#173;shaped central lesion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">5</span>). FA shows early blocked fluorescence with a surrounding zone of hyperfluorescence. Late staining of the vitelliform material may occur and may help distinguish &#173;these cases from AMD. &#173;These features may occur in younger individuals (younger than 50&#160;years). On the other hand, &#173;these changes may also be pres&#173;ent in older individuals who have the more typical drusen and RPE abnormalities associated with AMD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ret&#173;i&#173;nal signs of <span class="italic">drug toxicity,</span> such as concentric macular atrophy caused by hydroxychloroquine toxicity, may resemble progressive geographic atrophy of AMD. Central RPE mottling associated with deferoxamine toxicity or cisplatin may also resemble nonneovascular AMD. A history of specific drug ingestion and lack of large drusen may help differentiate &#173;these abnormalities from AMD (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;15</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Management of nonneovascular AMD</p>
			<p class="h4-text-h3"><span class="h4-head">Education and follow-&#173;up</span> Eyes with soft drusen and RPE hyperpigmentation are at increased risk of developing GA and CNV. &#173;Because of this risk, patients with nonneovascular AMD should be educated about the symptoms of advanced AMD and instructed to contact an ophthalmologist promptly should &#173;these symptoms occur; ophthalmology office staff should respond to patient concerns without delay. If reduced VA or reduced vision function (eg, difficulty reading despite good mea&#173;sured visual acuity) is noted, a low vision evaluation should be considered &#173;after treatable pathology has been ruled out. Periodic examinations are advised to monitor for concurrent, treatable eye disease (eg, cataract, glaucoma) and to reevaluate low-&#173;vision needs.

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Amsler grid testing</span> Patients can use the Amsler grid at home to monitor for exudative macular degeneration; the test card contains white grid lines on a black background and a central dot for fixation. Each eye is tested <span class="italic">individually</span> with reading glasses and at reading distance to check for any new metamorphopsia, scotoma, or other significant changes in central vision. Any changes noted by the patient should be evaluated promptly. Recent online or smart-&#173;phone application versions of the Amsler grid offer greater con&#173;ve&#173;nience for both patients and clinicians; the test results are instantly uploaded to alert the treating ophthalmologist of any acute visual changes.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Hyperacuity testing</span> Vernier acuity mea&#173;sures a patient’s ability to detect deviations in alignment of visual objects, for example 2 line segments. <span class="italic">Hyperacuity</span> is what helps the viewer discern minute deviations, down to even a single point on a line. Hyperacuity is extremely sensitive to any geometric shift in the outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal morphology, producing a perception of distortion. Preferential hyperacuity perimetry (PHP), which has been studied extensively, can detect recent-&#173;onset CNV in intermediate AMD patients with high sensitivity (82%), and high specificity (88%). One of &#173;those studies, the HOME study, which was a phase 3 randomized clinical trial with 1520 participants, demonstrated the efficacy and potential benefit of PHP in earlier CNV detection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Shape-&#173;discrimination hyperacuity (SDH) employs a similar princi&#173;ple but instead tests for discrimination of shapes, such as the ability to discern a perfect circle from a distorted contour. A handheld SDH test, which is currently in &#173;trials, can be implemented as a smart-&#173;phone application for frequent, regular home monitoring.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Micronutrients</span> Ophthalmologists should counsel patients about vari&#173;ous epidemiologic studies that have demonstrated positive associations between the intake of certain micro&#173;nutrients and a decreased risk of AMD, although only some micronutrients have been studied.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">AREDS</span> (Age-&#173;Related Eye Disease Study) first established the benefit of vitamin and zinc supplementation in reducing the risk of vision loss in nonexudative AMD. In the study, &#173;after supplementation with the antioxidant vitamins C (500&#160;mg) and E (400&#160;IU), beta carotene (15&#160;mg), and the micronutrient zinc (80&#160;mg zinc oxide and 2&#160;mg cupric oxide to prevent zinc-&#173;induced anemia), patients with intermediate or advanced AMD showed a 25% risk reduction for progression to more-&#173;advanced stages of AMD and a 19% risk reduction in rates of moderate vision loss (<span class="symbol">≥</span>3 lines of visual acuity) at 5&#160;years. The study defined intermediate (stage 3) AMD as the presence of at least 1 large druse (<span class="symbol">≥</span>125 μm), extensive intermediate drusen (63–124 μm dia&#173;meter), or nonsubfoveal GA; advanced (stage 4) AMD was defined as vision loss due to neovascular AMD or subfoveal GA in only 1 eye. At 10&#160;years, 44% of placebo recipients compared with 34% of the supplement recipients had advanced AMD (a 23% risk reduction). Among participants with no AMD or with only early-&#173;stage AMD (a few small drusen), &#173;there was no mea&#173;sur&#173;able benefit. &#173;There was no increased mortality among patients taking the formula recommended by AREDS.</p>
			<p class="body-text">AREDS developed a simplified 4-&#173;point grading scale for classifying the severity of AMD and predicting the disease course based on the following findings:</p>

			<p class="body-text">A follow-up study, <span class="italic">AREDS2,</span> tested &#173;whether replacing beta carotene with xanthophylls (lutein and zeaxanthin) and adding omega-3 long-&#173;chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs: docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]) would further help reduce AMD progression in a large prospective trial. The response of the 4000 participants in the study confirmed the overall risk reduction found in the original AREDS study and concluded that lutein and zeaxanthin had similar effects to beta carotene, but without its increased risk for lung cancer in current and former smokers (reported in other studies). It also confirmed that 80&#160;mg of zinc is an appropriate dose for AMD prophylaxis. The addition of LCPUFAs did not decrease the rate of progression to advanced AMD. The study’s final recommendation was to modify the original AREDS supplement, replacing beta carotene with lutein and zeaxanthin, and not to add LCPUFAs (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;4-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-table">2</span>).

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Lifestyle changes</span> With increasing evidence that environment and health habits influence the development and progression of AMD, patients should be counseled to alter be&#173;hav&#173;iors that put them at risk. Of par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar importance are smoking cessation, obesity reduction, and blood pressure control. Cataract surgery has not been linked consistently to the progression of AMD, nor is &#173;there strong evidence linking UV (UV-&#173;A or UV-&#173;B) light exposure to the progression of AMD. It should be noted, however, that &#173;there are no adverse effects from wearing UV-&#173;protective glasses.</p>
			<p class="h3">Disproven treatment approaches for nonneovascular AMD</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Macular &#173;laser photocoagulation has been shown to stimulate drusen resolution or reduction, but &#173;there is no associated change in the natu&#173;ral course of vision loss or CNV development. No role was demonstrated for rheopheresis (filtering blood to alter its viscosity) in treatment of nonneovascular AMD. Lampalizumab (also known as <span class="italic">anti-&#173;factor&#160;D</span>), which selectively inhibits activation of the alternative complement pathway, has been studied in large phase-3 studies of patients with GA and was not found to be effective in preventing progression of the disease.</p>
			<p class="h2">Neovascular AMD</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The presence of CNV is the defining characteristic of the neovascular form of AMD. Degenerative changes in Bruch membrane (eg, the accumulation of drusen and progressive thickening of the membrane that characterize nonneovascular AMD) provide a proangiogenic environment that can stimulate neovascularization to develop in the choriocapillaris and perforate the membrane. &#173;These new vessels, which are accompanied by fibroblasts, may leak and bleed, disrupting the normal architecture of the RPE–&#173;photoreceptor complex with a degenerate fibrovascular complex that ultimately produces a hypertrophic fibrotic disciform scar.</p>
			<p class="h3">Signs and symptoms of neovascular AMD</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with neovascular AMD describe a sudden onset of decreased vision, metamorphopsia, and/or paracentral scotomas. Amsler grid self-&#173;testing by patients is highly effective for early detection of neovascular AMD. Clinical signs of CNV may include subret&#173;i&#173;nal or intraret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid (eg, CME), exudate and/or blood, a pigment ring or gray-&#173;green membrane, irregular elevation of the RPE or a PED, an RPE tear, and/or a sea-&#173;fan pattern of subret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels.</p>
			<p class="h3">Anatomical classification of CNV</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Currently, CNV is classified according to its level of origin. In type 1 neovascularization, new vessels originating from the choriocapillaris grow through a defect in Bruch membrane into the sub–&#173;RPE space (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">6</span>). Fluid leakage and bleeding can produce a vascularized serous or fibrovascular PED. &#173;These fibrovascular PEDs typically have an irregular surface contour. In type 2 neovascularization, the CNV originates between the RPE and the neurosensory ret&#173;ina. On examination, it typically appears as a lacy or gray-&#173;green lesion; in AMD, this finding is less common than type 1 neovascularization. In type 3 neovascularization, the neovascularization develops from the deep capillary plexus of the ret&#173;ina and grows downward &#173;toward the RPE. &#173;Because of their intraret&#173;i&#173;nal origin, &#173;these lesions &#173;were originally termed <span class="italic">ret&#173;i&#173;nal angiomatous proliferations</span> <span class="italic">(RAPs).</span> On examination, they often appear as a small area of red discoloration, associated with ret&#173;i&#173;nal exudate or a bleb of subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Left untreated, &#173;these neovascular membranes typically evolve into a hypertrophic, fibrotic scar that is disciform in appearance. The overlying ret&#173;ina suffers a loss of normal outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal architecture, which can lead to severe, permanent central vision loss.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Fluorescein angiography of CNV</span> FA patterns of CNV may be classified as classic, occult, or some combination of both. Classic CNV refers to a bright, lacy, and well-&#173;defined hyperfluorescent lesion that appears in the early phase and progressively leaks by the late phases (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">7</span>). Occult CNV refers to more diffuse hyperfluorescence that takes 1 of 2 forms: (1) PED, &#173;either fibrovascular PED or vascularized serous PED, or (2) late leakage from an undetermined source.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Fibrovascular PED</span> is an irregular elevation of the RPE with progressive, stippled leakage on FA. Alternatively, the PED may pool dye rapidly in a homogenous ground-&#173;glass pattern that is consistent with a serous PED but has a notch, or hot spot, due to a vascular component, hence the term <span class="italic">vascularized serous PED</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">8</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Late leakage from an undetermined source</span> describes fluorescence at the level of the RPE that is poorly defined in the early phases of FA, but better appreciated in the late phases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The angiographic appearance of occult CNV is consistent with type 1 neovascularization, whereas the appearance of classic CNV is more often related to type 2 neovascularization; however, this is not a hard-&#173;and-&#173;fast rule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Type 3 neovascularization, or RAPs, may appear as a spot of ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage in the macula. It produces a focal hot spot on FA and indocyanine green (ICG) angiography with late CME or pooling into a PED.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thick blood, pigment, scar tissue, or a PED may block fluorescence during angiography and obscure an under&#173;lying CNV. ICG angiography, with its longer wavelength fluorescence in the infrared spectrum, may be able to penetrate deeper through heme or pigment to reveal a hot spot that identifies CNV. &#173;Because it has 90% protein-&#173;binding, it can also differentiate between scar tissue or serous RPE fluid to reveal an active vascular lesion.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">SD-&#173;OCT of CNV</span> SD-&#173;OCT is noninvasive and is the most practical visualization technique for the diagnosis and classification of CNV as well as for monitoring the response to treatment. SD-&#173;OCT reveals the elevation of the RPE and PEDs produced by type 1 CNV. Serous PEDs appear as sharply elevated, dome-&#173;shaped lesions with hollow internal reflectivity and typically no associated subret&#173;i&#173;nal or intraret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid. Fibrovascular PEDs may or may not be sharply elevated and typically demonstrate lacy or polyp-&#173;like hyperreflective lesions on the undersurface of the RPE, with or without signs of contraction (Fig 4-9; Activity 4-1). Chronic fibrovascular PEDs often have a multilayered appearance due to sub-&#173;RPE cholesterol crystal precipitation in an aqueous environment; this appearance has been termed the “onion” sign. The fibrotic “bridge arch–&#173;shaped” serous PED can develop following anti–&#173;vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (anti-&#173;VEGF) treatment and is associated with poor visual outcome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Subret&#173;i&#173;nal hyperreflective material (SHRM), which is hyperreflective on SD-&#173;OCT, is found between the ret&#173;ina and RPE in eyes with CNV. SHRM has an adverse effect on visual acuity, and results in scarring if it persists. Complex fibrovascular scarring may be visualized in the sub-&#173;PED compartment, with or without associated subret&#173;i&#173;nal and/or intraret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Type 2 CNV appears as a hyperreflective band or plaque in the subneurosensory space, with associated subret&#173;i&#173;nal and/or intraret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid. Type 3 CNV pres&#173;ents on SD-&#173;OCT as hyperreflective foci emanating from the deep capillary plexus of the ret&#173;ina, with or without associated CME and PED. Recognition of &#173;these patterns may be helpful for differential diagnosis and predicting treatment outcomes.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">OCT Angiography of CNV</span> OCT angiography (OCTA) reveals the structural details of CNV. The fine details of the vascular architecture of each CNV type can be easily visualized, &#173;free of the blur caused by fluorescein leakage in fluorescein angiography (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 4-10, 4-11, and 4-12).</span></p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy</span> Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), initially called <span class="italic">posterior uveal bleeding syndrome,</span> is a variant of CNV (type 1) and pres&#173;ents with multiple, recurrent serosanguineous RPE detachments. A network of polyps is associated with feeder vessels that adhere to the RPE monolayer of the fibrovascular PED in a “string-&#173;of-&#173;pearls” configuration. Although PCV was first discovered in hypertensive middle-&#173;aged &#173;women of African American or Asian ancestry, it has since been identified in &#173;women and men of all races. In Asians, however, 20%–50% of cases of neovascular AMD are PCV type, whereas in whites the PCV type is responsible for <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>5% of cases of CNV. The associated serosanguineous detachments are often peripapillary and multifocal but may be peripheral, and &#173;there may be associated nodular, orange, subret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions. Vitreous hemorrhage occurs more frequently in association with PCV than in non-&#173;PCV AMD. Soft drusen, typical in AMD, may or may not be pres&#173;ent. A thickened or so-&#173;called <span class="italic">pachychoroid</span> is often pres&#173;ent on EDI-&#173;OCT. Natu&#173;ral history and visual acuity outcomes of PCV may be better than &#173;those of CNV associated with AMD, except in cases with severe subret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-&#173;13</span>; see also Chapter&#160;2, Fig 2-11&#160;in this volume). ICG angiography, SD-&#173;OCT, and OCTA are useful for identifying the polyps. PCV is less responsive to anti-&#173;VEGF therapy than other types of CNV. The Everest Studies demonstrated that photodynamic therapy with verteporfin, with or without ranibizumab, results in better treatment response than ranibizumab alone.</p>

			<p class="h3">Differential diagnosis of neovascular AMD</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are many conditions associated with disruption of the Bruch membrane complex and secondary CNV that can mimic the CNV of AMD (see the section Other &#173;Causes of Choroidal Neovascularization &#173;later in this chapter).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Central serous chorioretinopathy can easily be confused with AMD. Subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid may be seen in both conditions; however, eyes with CSC typically do not have associated subret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage &#173;unless secondary CNV has developed. The choroidal layer, which is best visualized using EDI-&#173;OCT, is typically thick in eyes with CSC compared to the typical thin choroidal layer in eyes with AMD. CSC is further characterized by geographic patches of RPE pigment mottling that may extend to the inferior periphery in a drainage or drippage-&#173;like gravitational configuration often referred to as “guttering.” &#173;These lesions can be visualized with fluorescein angiography or autofluorescence imaging.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management of neovascular AMD</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If neovascular AMD is suspected clinically, OCT and FA studies should be obtained to help establish the diagnosis as well as for monitoring response to therapy.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h4-head">&#173;Laser photocoagulation (“thermal &#173;laser”)</span> Thermal &#173;laser treatment is now used only in very rare instances due to poor outcomes from high recurrence rates, as revealed in the Macular Photocoagulation Study &#173;Trials. Lesions sufficiently peripheral to the foveal center that pres&#173;ent minimal risk of iatrogenic foveal &#173;laser damage and lower rate of recurrence may still benefit form &#173;laser photocoagulation treatment.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h4-head">Photodynamic therapy (“cold &#173;laser”)</span> PDT was introduced in 2000 as a less-&#173;destructive phototherapy for treating CNV. Treatment involves intravenous administration of the photosensitizing drug verteporfin followed by the application of light of a specific wavelength. The light incites a localized photochemical reaction in the targeted area, resulting in CNV thrombosis. Although PDT slows progression, it does not prevent significant vision loss in most eyes with CNV and has been shown to upregulate VEGF in the treatment area. Use of PDT for the management of exudative AMD is now rare, except for the most recalcitrant cases or for eyes with PCV.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h4-head">Antiangiogenic therapies</span> Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels that sprout from existing vessels via a complex cascade of events. The first events in that cascade are vasodilation of existing vessels and increased vascular permeability. Next comes degradation of the surrounding extracellular matrix, facilitating migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. As endothelial cells join to create lumen, new capillaries develop and then mature, remodeling into stable vascular networks. This cascade requires a balanced interplay of growth-&#173;promoting and growth-&#173;inhibiting angiogenic &#173;factors to proceed. Activators of angiogenesis include vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth &#173;factor (FGF), transforming growth &#173;factor <span class="greek">α</span> (TGF-&#173;<span class="greek">α</span>) and TGF-<span class="greek">&#173;β</span>, angiopoietin-1, and angiopoietin-2. Inhibitors of angiogenesis include thrombospondin, angiostatin, en&#173;dostatin, and pigment epithelium–&#173;derived &#173;factor (PEDF).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most antiangiogenesis research has focused on the inhibition of VEGF, which increases in pigment epithelial cells in the early stages of AMD. High concentrations of VEGF in excised CNV and vitreous samples from patients with AMD have further suggested a causal role for VEGF in the initiation of neovascularization. VEGF is a homo&#173;dimeric glycoprotein that has a heparin-&#173;binding growth &#173;factor specificity for vascular endothelial cells. It induces vascular permeability, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis, and it acts as a survival &#173;factor for endothelial cells by preventing apoptosis. &#173;There are at least 4 major VEGF isoforms; VEGF<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">165</span> is thought to be the most dominant in AMD.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Pegaptanib</span> In 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first intravitreal anti-&#173;VEGF therapy, pegaptanib, an RNA oligonucleotide ligand (or aptamer) that binds &#173;human VEGF<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">165</span>. Studies showed that it slowed vision loss, but it has since been supplanted by more effective agents.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Ranibizumab</span> Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized antibody fragment (Fab) that binds VEGF. Ranibizumab binds to and inhibits all active isoforms of VEGF-&#173;A as well as their active degradation products. Two studies, MARINA (Minimally Classic/Occult Trial of the Anti-&#173;VEGF Antibody Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Neovascular AMD) and ANCHOR (Anti-&#173;VEGF Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic Choroidal Neovascularization in AMD), demonstrated a loss of fewer than 15 ETDRS in 95% of ranibizumab-&#173;treated patients at 12 months compared with 62% of sham-&#173;treated patients and 64% of PDT-&#173;treated patients. In addition, 30%–40% of ranibizumab-&#173;treated patients experienced visual acuity improvement of 15 letters or more compared with 5% or less in the control participants (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-14</span>, <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;4-3</span>). Approximately 90% of ranibizumab-&#173;treated eyes lost fewer than 15 ETDRS letters at 24 months.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Visual acuity improvements in participants of the PIER (Phase 3b, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-&#173;Masked, Sham Injection-&#173;Controlled Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Ranibizumab in Subjects With Subfoveal Choroidal Neovascularization With or Without Classic Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to AMD) and EXCITE (Efficacy and Safety of Ranibizumab in Patients With Subfoveal Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to AMD) studies &#173;were similar to the improvements seen in the MARINA and ANCHOR studies over the first 3 months; however, treatment effects declined in participants undergoing quarterly (&#173;every 3 months) ranibizumab dosing as opposed to monthly dosing. &#173;These results suggest that quarterly treatment is suboptimal. However, accepted anti-&#173;VEGF treatment methods that deviate from the FDA-&#173;approved monthly injections include “as needed” and “treat and extend.” On the as-&#173;needed regimen, regular treatment is administered &#173;until the macula appears dry clinically and on OCT; &#173;after that, treatment is only resumed when signs of recurrent exudation appear. The treat-&#173;and-&#173;extend regimen also involves administration of regular monthly treatment &#173;until the macula is dry; &#173;after that, treatment continues at progressively increasing intervals. This more cautious second approach continues to treat inactive CNV (albeit at longer intervals between injections) to avoid sudden recurrence of exudation (see Fig 4-14).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several clinical &#173;trials have evaluated as-&#173;needed approaches to anti-&#173;VEGF therapy: PrONTO (Prospective Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging of Patients With Neovascular AMD Treated With Intraocular Ranibizumab), SAILOR (Study to Evaluate Ranibizumab in Subjects With Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to AMD), SUSTAIN (Study of Ranibizumab in Patients with Subfoveal Choroidal Neovascu&#173;larization Secondary to AMD), and HORIZON (Open-&#173;Label Extension Trial of Ranibizumab for Choroidal Neovascularization Secondary to AMD). In each of &#173;these studies, participants &#173;were administered 3 monthly injections, followed by vari&#173;ous as-&#173;needed treatment regimens based on clinical and OCT-&#173;guided criteria. All of the studies had vision and OCT outcomes comparable to or reduced from &#173;those obtained with MARINA and ANCHOR. The HORIZON study was a continuation trial of patients enrolled in prior ranibizumab AMD &#173;trials. Eyes that had gained 10.2 letters on the ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) eye chart during ANCHOR or MARINA &#173;after 2&#160;years of monthly injections declined in visual acuity, ending with only a mean 2.0-&#173;letter gain compared with baseline (ie, they lost nearly 8 letters once the regimen was switched from monthly injections to an as-&#173;needed protocol). Experts believed the reason participants in the HORIZON study experienced a decline in visual acuity was &#173;because the study did not offer any re-&#173;treatment guidelines for investigators, resulting in a mean of 3.6&#160;ranibizumab injections in the 12&#160;months of the extension trial. HARBOR (A Study of Ranibizumab Administered Monthly or on an As-&#173;Needed Basis in Patients With Subfoveal Neovascular AMD) compared higher-&#173;dose (2.0&#160;mg) with standard-&#173;dose (0.5&#160;mg) ranibizumab therapy and failed to find any difference in visual acuity or anatomical outcomes between the 2 dosages.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h4-head">Bevacizumab</span> In 2004, the FDA approved bevacizumab, which is a full-&#173;length monoclonal antibody against VEGF, for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. It has also been used “off-&#173;label” for the treatment of AMD via intravitreal and intravenous administration. Although bevacizumab and ranibizumab are manufactured by the same phar&#173;ma&#173;ceu&#173;ti&#173;cal com&#173;pany, &#173;there are impor&#173;tant differences between the drugs: bevacizumab is larger, with 2 antigen-&#173;binding domains, contrasted with the smaller ranibizumab with a single domain. In addition, bevacizumab costs substantially less, impacting its availability to some patients. &#173;Because full-&#173;length antibodies are not cleared as rapidly as fragment antibodies, intravitreal injections of bevacizumab have a longer systemic half-&#173;life than intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (~21 days for bevacizumab vs 2.2 hours for ranibizumab).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Bevacizumab’s similar efficacy compared with ranibizumab and its 40-&#173;fold lower &#173;wholesale cost has prompted several comparative efficacy studies. &#173;<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;4-4</span> summarizes the major studies comparing bevacizumab to ranibizumab efficacy in the management of neovascular AMD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CATT (Comparison of Age-&#173;Related Macular Degeneration Treatments &#173;Trials) was the first and largest multicenter, randomized clinical trial to compare the relative safety and efficacy of ranibizumab with bevacizumab for the treatment of neovascular AMD.

Results showed that bevacizumab was noninferior to ranibizumab therapy in monthly or as-&#173;needed delivery schedules over 2&#160;years. Mean letters gained from baseline &#173;were 8.8 letters in the ranibizumab-&#173;monthly group, 7.8 letters in the bevacizumab-&#173;monthly group, 6.7 letters in the ranibizumab as-&#173;needed group, and 5.0 letters in the bevacizumab as-&#173;needed group. Systemic adverse events &#173;were significantly greater in the bevacizumab (39.9%) than in the ranibizumab (31.7%) group, but death and arteriothrombotic events &#173;were not statistically dif&#173;fer&#173;ent between the 2 drugs. At 5&#160;years, vision gains in the first 2&#160;years &#173;were not sustained, but 50% of eyes maintained 20/40 or better visual acuity. Geographic atrophy development or increase appeared to be stimulated by anti-&#173;VEGF therapy, with evidence that progression was related to per&#173;sis&#173;tence or absence of subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clusters of severe vision loss due to endophthalmitis following bevacizumab injection related to a few instances of substandard and erroneous compounding practices have raised concerns about the off-&#173;label use of this drug in the United States. In response, legislative changes have led to improved regulation and increased monitoring of compounding pharmacies.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-2"><span class="h4-head">Treatment effect modifiers</span> Vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal interface status may significantly modify the response to therapy with anti-&#173;VEGF agents. Hyaloidal separation appears to facilitate penetration of drug, so that fewer injections need to be administered, however, visual acuity is not affected. Eyes with epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane may require more injections due to anatomic disturbance, reduced penetration, or associated inflammation.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Complications of intravitreal anti-&#173;angiogenic therapy</span> Intravitreal injections are typically well tolerated. Minor complications such as subconjunctival hemorrhage and local irritation are common. In rare instances, serious ocular complications can occur, including inflammation, per&#173;sis&#173;tent ocular hypertension, ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and endophthalmitis. The rate of endophthalmitis is approximately 1&#160;in 2000 or lower (see also Chapter&#160;20 of this volume). Systemic administration of bevacizumab for cancer treatment has been shown to increase the risk of hypertension; thromboembolic events, especially myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarctions and ce&#173;re&#173;bral vascular accidents; gastrointestinal perforations; and bleeding. &#173;There is conflicting evidence &#173;whether intravitreal injections of any of &#173;these agents increase the rate of &#173;these complications.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Combination treatment</span> Combinations of therapies have been explored to address the complex interaction between inflammation, angiogenesis, and fibrosis that are thought to play a role in the limited success of the single agents currently available. &#173;Trials exploring the use of combination therapies (eg, RADICAL [Reduced Fluence Visudyne-&#173;Anti-&#173;VEGF-&#173;Dexamethasone in Combination for AMD Lesions] and DENALI [Safety and Efficacy of Verteporfin PDT Administered in Conjunction With Ranibizumab Versus Ranibizumab Monotherapy in Patients With Subfoveal CNV Secondary to AMD]) found that adding PDT to ranibizumab reduced re-&#173;treatment rates compared with ranibizumab monotherapy. However, visual outcomes &#173;were inferior to monotherapy. Combination strategy appeared beneficial in some cases of PCV recalcitrant to anti-&#173;VEGF therapy. Adding radiation to ranibizumab therapy may also reduce the injection burden, but again, visual outcomes &#173;were inferior to monotherapy.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Surgical treatments</span> In cases of thick submacular hemorrhage, intravitreal or subret&#173;i&#173;nal tissue plasminogen activator injection with pneumatic displacement may be helpful in some patients. Submacular surgery, involving the removal of the CNV from beneath the fovea, and macular translocation surgery, in which the fovea is moved over to an area of healthier RPE, are complex surgical techniques that &#173;were developed prior to anti-&#173;VEGF agents and have largely been abandoned &#173;today.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Low vision therapies</span> Despite the success of intravitreal anti-&#173;VEGF pharmacotherapy, a significant number of patients with AMD &#173;will ultimately pro&#173;gress to bilateral central blindness, for which few therapeutic options exist. The implantable miniature telescope can provide magnification up to &#173;factor of 2.7; its use improved visual acuity by 2 lines in the pivotal FDA &#173;trials. However, corneal decompensation due to endothelial cell loss is projected to bring the corneal transplant rate to 5% at 5&#160;years &#173;after the implantation surgery.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Low vision rehabilitation</span> Vision loss of any degree can have a profound effect on a patient’s daily activities, especially reading and driving. Severe vision loss and central blindness resulting from AMD can be devastating. In addition, central scotomas may be complicated by visual release hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome), which can overlay blank areas with small geometric figures or &#173;faces or any other image. Although primary efforts are focused on rescue therapies, consideration should be given to low vision rehabilitation strategies. Low vision rehabilitation and the use of optical and non&#173;optical devices can maintain the patient’s functional status and sustain quality of life (see BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics</span>). Even patients who have under&#173;gone successful anti-&#173;VEGF therapy may retain visual acuity that has been reduced to the 20/50–20/70 range and can benefit from low vision strategies such as magnification (eg, high-&#173;plus lenses, video magnifiers), optimal lighting, and contrast enhancement techniques. Training on the use of eccentric fixation outside the area of scotoma that is produced by the disciform scar or area of atrophy may also be helpful. To foster such rehabilitation, clinicians should consider referring patients for low vision evaluation at local low vision centers or to state ser&#173;vices for the blind, available in most US states.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-10">Other Causes of Choroidal Neovascularization</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A number of other conditions may produce non-&#173;AMD macular degenerative changes with central vision loss caused by CNV, atrophy, or scarring. CNV management, while historically focused on &#173;laser therapies or PDT, has evolved to incorporate intravitreal anti-&#173;VEGF agents using treatment protocols similar to &#173;those used for neovascular AMD, with similar visual acuity gains.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Histoplasma capsulatum</span> fungus is endemic to the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys. &#173;Humans become infected by inhaling the yeast form of this fungus, which then disseminates throughout the bloodstream. Although the systemic infection eventually subsides, the individual may be left with chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal scars that produce visual symptoms years &#173;later.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Ocular histoplasmosis syndrome</span> <span class="italic">(OHS)</span> is also referred to as <span class="italic">presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome</span> <span class="italic">(POHS)</span> &#173;because the causality has never been definitively confirmed. OHS is most prevalent among the population with the greatest percentage of positive skin reactors; over 90% of patients with the characteristic OHS fundus appearance react positively to histoplasmin skin testing. In 1 community with endemic histoplasmosis (where 60% of the total population reacted positively to histoplasmin skin testing), the characteristic peripheral lesions of OHS occurred in 2.6% of the total population surveyed and in 4.4% of the positive skin test responders. Only 1 individual with peripheral lesions showed disciform macular disease. The organism has been identified histologically in the choroid of 5 patients with OHS. Nevertheless, other etiologies besides <span class="italic">H capsulatum</span> may produce a similar phenotype (see also the section “Multifocal choroiditis” in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinically, OHS pres&#173;ents with small, atrophic, “punched-&#173;out” chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal scars in the midperiphery and posterior pole (“histo spots”), linear peripheral atrophic tracks, and juxtapapillary chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal scarring with or without CNV in the macula (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-&#173;15</span>). Lesions are bilateral in more than 60% of infected individuals, and characteristically, &#173;there is an absence of vitreous inflammation. Most patients with OHS are asymptomatic &#173;until the development of CNV, which may cause vision loss, metamorphopsia, and paracentral scotomas. FA and OCT findings are useful for guiding diagnosis and monitoring response to therapy. Other diseases with features similar to OHS include multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis; see also BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Management of ocular histoplasmosis syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There is no specific medical management necessary for OHS. When CNV develops, anti-&#173;VEGF therapy is helpful.</p>

			<p class="h2">Angioid Streaks</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Irregular dark red or brown lines radiating from a ring of peripapillary atrophy surrounding the optic nerve head are referred to as <span class="italic">angioid streaks</span> &#173;because their appearance mimics the appearance of blood vessels. On FA, characteristic win&#173;dow defects with late staining are noted resulting from dehiscences or cracks in the thickened and calcified Bruch membrane (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">16</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The systemic disease most commonly associated with angioid streaks is <span class="italic">pseudoxanthoma elasticum</span> (PXE), or Gr<span class="accent">ö</span>nblad-&#173;Strandberg syndrome, a predominantly autosomal recessive disorder inherited through mutation in the <span class="italic">ABCC6</span> gene located on band 16p13.1. Additional fundus findings associated with PXE include optic nerve head drusen, peripheral round atrophic scars with a “comet” sign, and a mottled RPE appearance referred to as <span class="italic">peau d’orange</span> (“skin of an orange”). <span class="italic">Paget disease</span> of bone, <span class="italic">beta thalassemia, sickle cell anemia</span> (SS), and <span class="italic">Ehlers-&#173;Danlos syndrome</span> may also be associated with angioid streaks. If the ophthalmologist establishes a new diagnosis of angioid streaks, and the patient is not known to have any of the aforementioned conditions, the patient should be referred for work-up and management of the pos&#173;si&#173;ble under&#173;lying systemic disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Angioid streaks usually are asymptomatic &#173;unless they are subfoveal. Visual disturbances may develop due to submacular hemorrhage resulting from trauma, but &#173;these disturbances may resolve spontaneously if &#173;there is no CNV. The most significant visual complication is the development of CNV.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Safety glasses are an advisable precaution for patients with angioid streaks &#173;because they can be highly susceptible to choroidal rupture following even minor blunt injury. Medical consultation is indicated to evaluate for systemic manifestations of PXE including “plucked chicken” skin appearance, calcific arteriosclerosis of coronary arteries, and gastro&#173;intestinal and cerebrovascular bleeding.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When CNV develops, treatment with anti-&#173;VEGF agents has supplanted the use of &#173;laser treatment or PDT, as noted previously.</p>

			<p class="h2">Pathologic Myopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">CNV may develop in 5%–10% of eyes with an axial length greater than 26.5&#160;mm, with or without lacquer cracks or widespread chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 4-17</span>). Treatment with &#173;laser therapy is often complicated when the &#173;laser scar expands through the foveal center over time (so-&#173;called <span class="italic">atrophy creep</span>). Although PDT has been shown to be beneficial, the mainstay of treatment is now intravitreal anti-&#173;VEGF therapy due to the excellent visual and anatomical outcomes. Several studies have demonstrated sustained regression of myopic CNV &#173;after anti-&#173;VEGF treatment, with stabilization or improvement of visual acuity &#173;after only 1 or 2 injections.

OCT shows a subfoveal pigment epithelial detachment with associated subretinal fluid, intraretinal fluid, and intrarenal hyperre&#173;flective material. There is also an area of hyperreflective material on the underside of the RPE, likely representing a neovascular complex (see slices 13 and 14 in Activity 4-1). Scrolling through the macula in Activity 4-1 reveals the extent of the lesion, as well as RPE irregularities that resemble small pigment epithelial detachments (drusen). <span class="figure-source-note">(Courtesy of Colin A.
