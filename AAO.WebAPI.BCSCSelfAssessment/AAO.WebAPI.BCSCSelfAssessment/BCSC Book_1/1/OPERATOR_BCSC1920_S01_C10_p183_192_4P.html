			<p class="h1">Introduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The median age of the world’s population is increasing almost exponentially. In the United States, the population aged 65&#160;years and older is projected to more than double, from 46 million in 2016 to over 98 million by 2060, representing 14.9% and nearly 25% of the total population, respectively. In addition, the number of persons aged 85&#160;years and older is expected to &#173;triple, from 6.2&#160;million in 2014 to 19.7&#160;million in 2060. Worldwide, over the same period, the population aged 65&#160;years and older is projected to increase by approxi&#173;mately 617 million, up to 1.6 billion, from 8.5% to 16.7%. In the next 15&#160;years, the number of older persons is expected to grow fastest in Latin Amer&#173;i&#173;ca and the Ca&#173;rib&#173;bean with a projected 71% increase, followed by Asia at 66%, Africa at 64%, Oceania at 47%, and Eu&#173;rope at 23%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This expanding older population pres&#173;ents a growing challenge to primary care physicians and medical subspecialists in the United States and Western Eu&#173;rope. The subspecialty of geriatrics emphasizes a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent medical paradigm of functional assessment and a more holistic approach to patient care compared with the traditional medical paradigm.</p>

			<p class="h1">Physiologic Aging and Pathologic Findings of the Aging Eye</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Age-&#173;related changes in sensation and perception can isolate individuals from their surrounding environments and trigger complex psychological reactions. &#173;These changes may include diminished hearing and vision, slowed intellectual and physical response times, and increased difficulty with memory. However, many physical and intellectual abilities are retained throughout the life span, and their loss should not be assumed to be part of the normal aging pro&#173;cess. &#173;These include the senses of taste and smell, intelligence, the ability to learn, and sexuality. Any change in physical, intellectual, or emotional capabilities may reflect under&#173;lying organic or psychological disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Age-&#173;related changes in the eye affect individuals differently. The periorbital and eyelid skin and soft tissues atrophy with age. Dermatochalasis and levator dehiscence may produce secondary ptosis. Eyelid laxity may cause entropion, ectropion, and trichiasis. Lacrimal gland dysfunction, decreased tear production, meibomian gland dysfunction, and goblet cell dysfunction may cause dry eye symptoms. As a result of the aging pro&#173;cess, the conjunctiva undergoes atrophic changes and corneal sensitivity is reduced. The pupils become progressively miotic and less reactive to light. &#173;There is an increasing incidence of presbyopia, cataract, glaucoma, AMD, and diabetic retinopathy. Contrast sensitivity and visual field sensitivity are reduced. In addition, refractive error (of some type) is pres&#173;ent in more than 90% of older patients and remains a significant cause of visual disability in the nursing home patient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Worldwide, the 4 leading &#173;causes of vision loss in the older population are AMD, glaucoma, cataract, and diabetic retinopathy. It is estimated that by 2030, 3.7 million persons in the United States &#173;will have AMD. Glaucoma &#173;will affect 4.3 million individuals by 2030 and becomes more common with increasing age; thus, screening is recommended for patients older than 50&#160;years. Cataract accounts for 50% of visual impairment in adults over the age of 40; it affects 1&#160;in &#173;every 6 &#173;people in this age group. It is projected that by 2030, 38.7&#160;million Americans &#173;will have cataracts. Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of new cases of &#173;legal blindness among working-&#173;aged Americans. The prevalence of retinopathy in individuals with diabetes mellitus aged 40&#160;years and older in the United States is 28.5% (4.2 million persons), and the prevalence of vision-&#173;threatening retinopathy is 4.4% (0.7 million persons). Assuming a similar prevalence for diabetes mellitus, the projected numbers in 2050 would be 16.0 million persons with diabetic retinopathy and 3.4 million persons with vision-&#173;threatening diabetic retinopathy.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Elder Abuse</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Elder abuse is an impor&#173;tant public health prob&#173;lem. It is a violation of &#173;human rights and is a significant cause of illness, injury, loss of productivity, isolation, and despair, according to the World Health Organ&#173;ization. The National Elder Abuse Incidence Study (1998) found that in 1996, nearly half a million&#160;persons aged 60&#160;years or older had been physically abused, neglected, or in some way mistreated. This study, which was based on Adult Protective Ser&#173;vice rec&#173;ords and sentinel reports (eg, reports from community professionals), very likely greatly underestimated the true scope of the prob&#173;lem of abuse of older Americans, &#173;because the majority of elder abuse cases are unreported and are undetected by monitoring agents. A 2017 study that summarized 52 studies in 28 countries from diverse regions estimated that over the past year, 15.7% of &#173;people aged 60 and over &#173;were subjected to some form of abuse. In the United States, the prevalence of elder maltreatment was reported as 7.6%–10% of study participants and is estimated to affect 11.4% of adults aged 60&#160;years and older. Worldwide, it is estimated that only 1&#160;in 24 cases of elder abuse is reported, in part &#173;because el&#173;derly individuals are often afraid to report the abuse to &#173;family, friends, or the authorities. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 25, states that “The Union recognizes and re&#173;spects the rights of the el&#173;derly to lead a life of dignity and in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dence and to participate in social and cultural life,” yet 47% of Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean &#173;people believe that poor treatment, neglect, and abuse of older &#173;people are common in their countries.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Major risk &#173;factors for elder abuse include external stresses due to marital, financial, and &#173;legal difficulties; dependent relationships (eg, the abuser may be dependent on the older patient for finances or housing, or vice versa); &#173;mental illness and substance abuse; social isolation; and misinformation about normal aging or about the patient’s medical or nutritional needs. Maltreatment can occur at home, in assisted living facilities, or in nursing homes. It can take the form of physical or psychological abuse, material misappropriation, neglect and abandonment, or sexual abuse.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Physical abuse means inflicting physical pain or injury upon an older adult. Psychological abuse includes verbal assaults, threats of abuse, harassment, and intimidation. Material misappropriation or financial abuse of the el&#173;derly includes taking money or property or using/misusing money or property without the own&#173;er’s knowledge or permission; forging or forcing an el&#173;derly person’s signature; misusing ATM cards or credit cards; and persuading an el&#173;derly individual to change a &#173;will or an insurance policy. Passive neglect is a caregiver’s failure to provide an older adult with life’s necessities such as food, &#173;water, hygiene, clothing, shelter, medical care, or medi&#173;cation. Neglect may be intentional or unintentional and may be related to financial constraints or lack of other resources (eg, transportation, supervision). Elder abuse also includes deprivation of basic rights (eg, decision-making for care, privacy) and abandonment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist may be the first physician to see an older patient who is being abused or neglected. The signs may be subtle, and early recognition is key. The ophthalmologist should suspect elder abuse in the following circumstances:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">broken eyeglasses, with a report by the patient of being slapped or abused</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">evidence of physical abuse (eg, bruises, black eyes, fractures, lacerations, wounds in vari&#173;ous stages of healing, burns, welts, patches of hair loss, or unexplained sub&#173;conjunctival, ret&#173;i&#173;nal, or vitreous hemorrhage)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">repeated visits to the emergency department or office</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">conflicting or noncredible history from caregiver or patient</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">unexplained delay in seeking treatment</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">unexplained, inconsistent, vague, or poorly explained injuries</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">history of being “accident prone”</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">expressions of ambivalence, anger, hostility, or fear by the patient &#173;toward the caregiver</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">poor adherence to follow-up or care instructions</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Sometimes it is necessary to obtain the patient history with the caregiver out of the room. Directed questions for the patient include “Has anyone at home tried to harm you?”; “Has anyone tried to make you do &#173;things that you &#173;don’t wish to do?”; and “Has anyone taken anything from you without your consent?”</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any suspected case of elder neglect or abuse should prompt a complete written report. Documentation of any suspicious injuries is mandatory, including type, size, location, and characteristics of injury and stage of healing. Requirements for reporting elder abuse vary from state to state, and many areas have abuse hotlines for reporting maltreatment. The physician should be aware of local ser&#173;vices for adult protection, community social ser&#173;vices, and law enforcement agencies.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Perioperative Considerations in the Management of Elderly Patients</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are several considerations that the ophthalmologist should take into account in the preoperative evaluation and perioperative management of el&#173;derly patients; loss of vision alone may not be an appropriate sole indication for surgical intervention (eg, cataract surgery). Functional assessment includes determining how vision loss affects instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) such as reading, driving, taking medi&#173;cations properly, and using the telephone in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dently; IADLs should be documented preoperatively. All prescription medi&#173;cations should also be documented to ensure that they do not interact with perioperative medi&#173;cations. An el&#173;derly patient may have multiple medical conditions that require use of numerous prescription medi&#173;cations. Some of &#173;these medi&#173;cations can even have ocular side effects. Please see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span> for further discussion. The management of informed consent should be considered; this pro&#173;cess may be dif&#173;fer&#173;ent in patients with mild dementia and in &#173;those who have &#173;legal guardians or caregivers who &#173;will need to participate in the pro&#173;cess.</p>
			<p class="body-text">El&#173;derly patients undergoing surgery may be prone to confusion or delirium perioperatively. Delirium is estimated to occur in approximately 4%–5% of patients &#173;after cataract surgery. Many &#173;causes for confusion are preventable. Minimization of preoperative sedation or psychotropic medi&#173;cations, appropriate patient and &#173;family orientation by nursing or ancillary staff, and careful supervision and reassurance in the postoperative period can diminish confusion. Often, a confused older patient simply needs a familiar face or reassurance to regain calm. The use of restraints should be minimized.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Confusion may be exacerbated in patients with vision loss or in &#173;those who require vision rehabilitation. In a monocular older patient, patching of the eye &#173;after surgery may aggravate confusion and disorientation. Having a &#173;family member in the recovery room can be very helpful. The patch should be removed as soon as pos&#173;si&#173;ble, and the patient should be provided with appropriate eye protection. Topical anesthetic may not be indicated &#173;because of comorbidities such as cognitive impairment and inability to cooperate during surgery. In addition, patients with decreased vision following intraocular surgery may experience limited mobility or be at increased risk for falls. Bed rest and immobilization can lead to disuse of extremities, development of pressure ulcers, and other prob&#173;lems. For &#173;these patients, active rehabilitation should be encouraged as soon as pos&#173;si&#173;ble.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Though rare in outpatient ophthalmic surgery, surgical or anesthesia complications may result in life-&#173;threatening conditions. The surgeon must pay careful attention to any preexisting directives (eg, do-&#173;not-&#173;resuscitate order or living &#173;will) prior to any surgical intervention (including &#173;laser treatments and periocular injections or anesthetics). By discussing pos&#173;si&#173;ble treatment decisions with the patient and &#173;family members early—&#173;preferably before any serious illness arises or, if a serious illness is pres&#173;ent, early in its course—&#173;the surgeon can avoid emergency decisions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some potential issues for discussion include limits of treatment, antibiotics, and changes in the patient’s living situation. Candidly and openly discussing &#173;these impor&#173;tant issues with the patient and the &#173;family (especially in cases of dementia) in the preoperative period allows them to consider &#173;these &#173;matters in the context of their belief systems and without the disorientation and confusion created by an emergency. The content, context, time, and date of such discussions should be well documented in the medical rec&#173;ord and communicated to the patient, the &#173;family, and the primary care physician or geriatrician.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Psychology of Aging</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The psy&#173;chol&#173;ogy of aging is influenced by a wide range of &#173;factors, including physical changes, adaptive mechanisms, and psychopathology. Each older patient has a unique psychological profile and social life history. Deleterious changes are not universal; in fact,&#160;in the absence of disease, growth of character and the ability to learn continue throughout life.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With age, the issue of loss becomes more prevalent. Losses—of status, physical abilities, loved ones, and income—&#173;become more frequent. A fear of loss of social and individual power, and the attendant loss of in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dence, is common. In addition, the real&#173;ity of death has increasing influence on a person’s psychological status. All of &#173;these losses increase the incidence of depression.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Depression</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Depression is the most frequent psychiatric prob&#173;lem in the older population. Approximately one-&#173;quarter of older patients seen in primary care settings are clinically depressed. The prevalence of depression in patients with macular degeneration is even higher, at 30%–40%. The suicide rate in white American men older than 65&#160;years is 5&#160;times greater than that of the general population; loneliness is the main reason cited, along with financial prob&#173;lems and poor health. Successful suicide is much less common in older American &#173;women, but older &#173;women attempt suicide more often than do men.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The criteria set forth in the <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of &#173;Mental Disorders, </span>Fifth Edition (DSM-5), make a clear separation between depressive symptoms that result from a general medical condition and the medi&#173;cation used to treat it from late-&#173;life depression. An alternative diagnosis of mood disorder is preferred for the former.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Major depressive disorder is characterized by episodes of at least 2&#160;weeks of depressed mood or loss of interest or plea&#173;sure in activities with 4 or more of the following symptoms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">changes in appetite with associated weight loss or gain</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">significant weight loss or gain</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">sleep disturbance</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">agitation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">diminished libido</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">retardation (slowing down)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">loss of energy</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">feelings of worthlessness or guilt</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">difficulties in concentration and decision-making</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">recurrent thoughts of suicide or death</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although the signs and symptoms of depression in older individuals are similar to &#173;those seen in younger age groups, older depressed patients are <span class="italic">more likely</span> than younger patients to have somatic or hypochondriacal complaints, minimize depression symptoms (masked depression), and have psychotic delusional disease. However, they are <span class="italic">less likely</span> to report symptoms of guilt. The most frequent pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions of subclinical depression include new medical complaints, fatigue, poor concentration, exacerbation of existing symptoms and medical prob&#173;lems, preoccupation with health, and diminished interest in pleas&#173;ur&#173;able activities.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist’s role is to recognize and refer the patient with depression or to be aware of precipitating &#173;factors. For instance, loss of function, such as moderate or severe vision loss, can precipitate depression, as can recent death of a spouse. Ophthalmic medi&#173;cations such as <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-&#173;blockers and <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-&#173;agonists can cause fatigue, depression, and diminished cognition. Red flags may include frequent visits to the ophthalmology office and unexplained vision loss. Though not prevalent in the ophthalmology setting, testing patients for depression might be enormously helpful in attaining care for &#173;those patients who have this disorder; an appropriate referral for such testing may be necessary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many targeted screening tests, also called case-&#173;finding instruments, ask about depressed mood and <span class="italic">anhedonia,</span> a psychological condition characterized by inability to experience plea&#173;sure in acts that normally produce it. Most of &#173;these instruments require more time than is available during a typical office visit. A briefer case-&#173;finding instrument, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), is a suggested screening device. It is sensitive, but not specific; it does not suggest or establish a final diagnosis or monitor depression severity, but screens for depression in a “first step” approach. The self-&#173;report questionnaire consists of the following 2&#160;questions:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;During the past month, have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">2.&#9;During the past month, have you often been bothered by &#173;little interest or plea&#173;sure in &#173;doing &#173;things?</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the first question is answered in the affirmative, it is highly likely that the patient has depression. The added sensitivity and greater specificity provided by the second question, if answered in the affirmative, makes it worthwhile to ask the questions. A score of 2 or 3 on &#173;either question is considered a positive response to this 2-&#173;question test and is in line with DSM criteria for depression. Further information on the PHQ-2 is available on the website of the Center for Quality Assessment and Improvement in &#173;Mental Health (<a href="http://www.cqaimh.org">www.&#173;cqaimh.&#173;org</a>; see STABLE Resource Toolkit). &#173;After using the PHQ-2 to evaluate a patient, the ophthalmologist may conclude that further evaluation by the patient’s primary care physician is necessary.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Osteoporosis</span> is defined by the World Health Organ&#173;ization as a disease “characterized by low bone mass and micro-&#173;architectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and a consequent increase in risk of fracture.” Osteoporosis is a significant, worldwide public health prob&#173;lem that is becoming increasingly common. It is estimated that globally, 1 of &#173;every 2&#160;&#173;women and 1 of &#173;every 4&#160;men older than 50&#160;years &#173;will have an osteoporosis-&#173;related fracture. In the United States, 1.5&#160;million fractures related to osteoporosis occur annually, with the estimated cost of caring for &#173;these patients approaching $18&#160;billion. This number is expected to &#173;triple by the year&#160;2040. In older patients, a broken hip can increase mortality fourfold. &#173;Those with hip fractures have a 20% risk of entering a nursing home within a year of their fracture, and it is estimated that almost 50% of &#173;women with hip fractures do not fully regain previous function. Many patients with hip fractures experience a decline in function, along with increased feelings of isolation, depression, and fear of falling. In an individual with osteoporosis, the potential for falling becomes even more impor&#173;tant.</p>

The class of drugs known as bisphosphonates, which are often prescribed for postmenopausal &#173;women to inhibit bone resorption, can affect eye health. &#173;These drugs are associated with inflammatory disease of the eye, including conjunctivitis, uveitis, and episcleritis. Scleritis, which can be vision threatening, has also been reported. On the other hand, a study of veterans determined that the rates of uveitis and/or scleritis following dispensing of a bisphosphonate drug &#173;were low and did not differ significantly from &#173;those of the control group.</p>

			<p class="h1">Falls</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Falls are a leading cause of injury and death in older Americans. The incidence and severity of falls rises with increasing age. Approximately one-&#173;third of US adults older than 65&#160;years fall each year, yet less than half talk to their physicians about it. In 2010, about 21,700 older adults in the United States died as a result of unintentional fall injuries. In 2014 alone, older Americans experienced 29 million falls, resulting in 7 million injuries and incurring about $31 billion in annual Medicare costs. Falls are responsible for more than 60% of all traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) in &#173;people over 65&#160;years old. In the United States, fall-&#173;related TBIs are responsible for 14,347 deaths per year. Men are more likely to die from a fall. Older white individuals are 2.4&#160;times more likely to die from falls than are older black individuals. Also, &#173;there are differences in fatal fall rates among ethnic groups; older non-&#173;Hispanic persons have higher fatal fall rates than do older Hispanic persons. Fear of falling may cause el&#173;derly persons to limit activities, leading to reduced physical fitness, which, in turn, increases the &#173;actual risk of falling.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prevention of falls is key. Older adults may reduce their chances of falling by</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-11">exercising regularly</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">increasing leg strength and balance</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">asking their physician or pharmacist to review any of their medi&#173;cations that might cause dizziness or drowsiness</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">having their eyes checked annually to update glasses or evaluate for eye diseases that limit vision</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">getting assistance to make their living areas safer by<ul><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">removing tripping hazards</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">installing grab bars in the bathroom and railings on the side of stairways (such as the entry to the home)</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list-last ParaOverride-12">improving lighting</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Visual disorders are a frequent cause of falls. Recent studies in the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that el&#173;derly individuals are almost twice as likely to fall if they are visually impaired. An ophthalmologist may help patients reduce the risk of falls by</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-11">asking patients appropriate questions about the activities listed above that might reduce fall risk</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-13">recognizing and treating visual disorders, including refractive errors, to identify and minimize ocular reasons for falls</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with reduced vision from eye disease, most often macular degeneration, are at the highest risk of falling. Once a history of falls is obtained, it is incumbent upon the ophthalmologist to notify the patient’s primary care physician about this finding or refer the patient to a multidisciplinary medical fa&#173;cil&#173;i&#173;ty with resources for managing falls in the el&#173;der&#173;ly.</p>

Cataract surgery improves functional visual status, resulting in overall improved health-&#173;related quality of life, &#173;mental health, and emotional well-&#173;being. Visual function plays an impor&#173;tant role in physical per&#173;for&#173;mance, especially in terms of mobility. The rate of falls in the &#173;elderly is diminished &#173;after cataract removal, with a lower incidence of hip fracture 1 year &#173;after the procedure when compared with patients with cataract who did not have cataract surgery.</p>
