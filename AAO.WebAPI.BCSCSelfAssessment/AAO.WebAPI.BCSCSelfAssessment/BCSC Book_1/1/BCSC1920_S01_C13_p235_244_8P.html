			<p class="h1">Introduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States; approximately 23% of all US deaths are due to cancer. In 2015, 1.6&#160;million new cases &#173;were diagnosed in the United States, and 595,919&#160;deaths occurred. In 2016, more than 15.5 million Americans had a history of cancer; it is estimated that cancer &#173;will develop in approximately 38% of US men and &#173;women during their lifetimes. Worldwide, in 2012, &#173;there &#173;were 14&#160;million new cases and 8.2&#160;million deaths due to cancer. Developing countries are disproportionately affected, accounting for 60% of all new cases and 70% of all deaths due to cancer.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cancer is the term used to refer to a group of related diseases; discussions of etiology, prevention, and cure must therefore address the specific types of tumors. Nonmelanotic skin cancers, including squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas, are the most common tumors, but &#173;these cancers are rarely a cause of death. &#173;After skin cancer, the most common forms of cancer in adult Americans (in decreasing order of incidence) are breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal. Approximately 80% of adult cancers arise from the epithelial tissues.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cancer is the second-&#173;leading cause of death in &#173;children younger than 15&#160;years in the United States, trailing only accidental death. Nevertheless, death rates have dropped, and survival rates have risen sharply. The 5-&#173;year survival rate for all childhood cancers combined has improved in the United States, from approximately 51% in 1973 to over 80% &#173;today.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Etiology</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cancer is caused by mutations in genes that control cell division. Some of &#173;these genes, called <span class="italic">oncogenes,</span> stimulate cell division; &#173;others, called <span class="italic">tumor suppressor genes,</span> slow this pro&#173;cess. In the normal state, both types of genes work together, enabling the body to replace dead cells and repair damaged ones. Mutations in &#173;these genes cause cells to proliferate out of control; &#173;these cells grow and divide without regard for cell death. The cell cycle is regulated biochemically, and 2&#160;impor&#173;tant groups of enzymes are involved in this pro&#173;cess: cyclin-&#173;dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclin-&#173;dependent phosphatases. (An example of CDK function involves the p53&#160;tumor suppressor gene, which upregulates the p21&#160;inhibitor of CDK function.)</p>
			<p class="body-text">Gene mutations can be inherited or can result from damage to DNA caused by environmental exposures. Cancer &#173;causes, therefore, are explained on the basis of chemical, radiation-&#173;related, or viral conditions that occur in a complex milieu, including the host’s ge&#173;ne&#173;tic composition and immunobiologic status. Epidemiologic data suggest that as many as 80% of the cases of cancer in &#173;humans may be due to exogenous or environmental chemical exposure. If &#173;these chemicals could be properly identified, a major proportion of &#173;human cancers could be prevented by reducing host exposure or by protecting the host.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The general population is exposed to both naturally occurring ionizing radiation and man-&#173;made ionizing radiation. Man-&#173;made sources include medical diagnostic equipment and technologically altered natu&#173;ral sources (such as phosphate fertilizers and building materials containing small amounts of radioactivity). The carcinogenic effects of radiation exposure result from molecular lesions caused by random interactions of radiation with atoms and molecules. Most molecular lesions induced in this way are of &#173;little consequence to the affected cell. However, DNA is not repaired with 100% efficiency, and mutations and chromosomal aberrations accrue with increasing radiation doses. Par&#173;ameters that influence the response of the target tissue include the total radiation dose, the dose rate, the quality of the radiation source, the characteristics of certain internal emitters (such as radioiodine), and individual host &#173;factors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The role of viruses in the etiology of cancer has been studied extensively. For example, researchers have inoculated laboratory animals with specific viruses to see &#173;whether tumor development is induced. Several &#173;human cancers show a definite correlation with viral infection and the presence and retention of specific virus nucleic acid sequences and virus proteins in the tumor cells. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;13-1</span> lists several viruses and their associated cancers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All the DNA virus groups have been associated with cancer, except the parvovirus &#173;family. This is notable &#173;because all the DNA viruses associated with cancer contain double-&#173;stranded DNA, whereas the parvoviruses contain only single-&#173;stranded DNA. Of the 9&#160;RNA virus groups, only&#160;1, the retrovirus group, is associated with oncogenicity. The papillomavirus of the papovavirus group has been associated with squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, and laryngeal papilloma in &#173;humans. A vaccine against &#173;human papillomavirus (HPV) is now available. Immunization against HPV may prevent most cases of cervical cancer in &#173;women; see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span> for additional discussion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fi&#173;nally, cancers may aggregate in a nonrandom manner in certain families. &#173;These cancers may be of the same type or dissimilar. In such cancer-&#173;cluster families, several &#173;children may have soft tissue sarcoma and relatives may have a variety of cancers, especially breast cancer in young &#173;women. Multiple endocrine neoplasia types&#160;1 and 2 are yet other examples of hereditary cancer syndromes. The recognition of familial cancer syndromes permits early detection that may be life-&#173;saving.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Radiation Therapy</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Radiation therapy, which uses ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors, is part of the treatment plan for many patients with cancer. Ionizing radiation interacts with tissues via an energy transfer and a chemical reaction, in which &#173;free radicals are released and &#173;water molecules decompose into hydrogen, hydroxyl, and perhydroxyl ionic forms. &#173;These ionic forms break atomic and molecular bonds, which in turn break the double-&#173;stranded DNA structure and cause cellular death. Consequent cell death occurs in both normal tissue and malignant lesions. In radiotherapy, biochemical recovery and biologic repair occur in the normal host cells, maintaining the integrity of vital systems.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In radiation oncology, <span class="italic">therapeutic ratio</span> refers to a fundamental concept in which the risks and benefits to the targeted cancer cells and the surrounding tissues must be weighed. Lymphocytes are damaged by 1&#160;gray (Gy) of radiation and central ner&#173;vous system tissue by 50&#160;Gy. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;13-2</span> lists some examples of the effects of radiation on ocular and nonocular tissues.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Radiation can be delivered through external beam radiotherapy (EBRT; most common) or internal placement (brachytherapy); radiation can also be administered systemically (eg, radioactive substance bound to a monoclonal antibody). In EBRT, high-&#173;energy x-&#173;ray beams generated &#173;either by linear accelerators, which produce photons or electrons, or by cobalt machines, which use radioactive decay of an ele&#173;ment such as cobalt&#160;60, are aimed at the tumor site. Planning for EBRT involves not only localizing the tumor, but also determining the proper dose of radiation: one that &#173;will kill the malignant cells while minimizing damage to the surrounding noncancerous tissue. &#173;There are many other &#173;methods of EBRT, including particle therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In brachytherapy (also called <span class="italic">internal radiation therapy</span>), radioactive material is implanted within or adjacent to the tumor, delivering radiation while minimizing damage to the surrounding normal tissue. The term <span class="italic">brachytherapy</span> refers to vari&#173;ous types of procedures, one example of which is seed implantation, used in the treatment of prostate cancer and some uveal melanomas. See <span class="xref-local">BCSC Section&#160;4</span>, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for more on brachytherapy and uveal melanomas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For some conditions, monoclonal antibodies are available as a vector to deliver radiation directly to the target tissue; &#173;these antibodies are discussed &#173;later in this chapter in <span class="xref-local">the section Biologic Therapies.</span></p>

Concomitant chemotherapy has an additive effect.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">The lens is the most radiosensitive structure in the eye, followed by the cornea, the ret&#173;ina, and the optic nerve. The orbit is completely included in the treatment portal in diseases such as large retinoblastomas; it is partially included in tumors of adjacent structures, such as the maxillary antrum, nasopharynx, ethmoid sinus, and nasal cavity. Usual radiation doses range from 20 to 100&#160;Gy. The total dose is usually fractionated into smaller doses during the treatment. In&#160;brachytherapy, a low-&#173;energy isotope such as radioactive iodine delivers a high dose of radiation within a few millimeters of the tumor but does not penetrate deep into it. This allows for radioactive episcleral implants to deliver a dose of 100&#160;Gy to the apex of a tumor but a much lower dose to the rest of the eye. The sclera can tolerate doses up to 400–800&#160;Gy.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">Doses to the lens as low as 2&#160;Gy in a single fraction may cause cataract formation. However, cataracts caused by low doses may be asymptomatic and may not pro&#173;gress. Cataracts resulting from higher doses (7–8&#160;Gy) may continue to pro&#173;gress, resulting in considerable vision loss. The average latent period for the development of radiation-&#173;induced cataracts is 2–3&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">The clinical picture of radiation retinopathy resembles that of diabetic retinopathy. The usual interval between radiation therapy and the development of radiation-&#173;induced retinopathy is 2–3&#160;years. Radiation retinopathy may develop earlier in patients with diabetes mellitus or in &#173;those undergoing chemotherapy. The earliest clinical manifestation of radiation retinopathy is usually cotton-&#173;wool spots. &#173;After several months, &#173;these spots fade away, leaving areas of capillary nonperfusion. Telangiectatic vessels grow from the ret&#173;ina into &#173;these areas. Microaneurysms may also develop. &#173;These ischemic changes may cause neovascularization of the iris, which in turn may lead to neovascular glaucoma. The capillary endothelial cell is the first type of cell to be damaged, followed closely by the pericytes and then the endothelial cells of the larger vessels. The new intraret&#173;i&#173;nal telangiectatic vessels have thick collagenous walls. &#173;There may be spotty occlusion of the choriocapillaris. Panret&#173;i&#173;nal photocoagulation or injection with anti–&#173;vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (anti-&#173;VEGF) agents are effective treatments for radiation retinopathy. See <span class="xref-local">BCSC Section&#160;12,</span> <span class="sidebar2-italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous,</span> for more on this topic.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text"><span class="sidebar2-italic">Radiation optic neuropathy</span> may pres&#173;ent with optic nerve head pallor with splinter hemorrhages. Injury to the more proximal part of the optic nerve resembles retrobulbar optic neuropathy. Affected patients may report unilateral headaches and ocular pain; the optic nerve head may not reveal edema or hemorrhage. With doses of 60–70&#160;Gy, dry eye syndrome sometimes develops. This syndrome usually develops within a year and occasionally progresses to corneal ulceration and severe pain.

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Chemotherapy</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goal of cancer chemotherapy is to damage or destroy cancer cells without killing normal cells. The type of chemotherapy treatment used depends on the treatment goals for the type and extent of the cancer being treated. <span class="italic">Curative chemotherapy</span> is used to eliminate cancer cells and to achieve a permanent cure for the patient. <span class="italic">Adjuvant chemotherapy</span> is given &#173;after surgical resection of the cancer to eliminate undetectable microscopic cancer cells. This method lowers recurrence rates in &#173;these patients. The goal of <span class="italic">neoadjuvant chemotherapy</span> is to shrink large tumors that would be too large for total resection, potentially creating a less invasive surgical procedure. <span class="italic">Palliative chemotherapy</span> is used when it is no longer pos&#173;si&#173;ble to remove all the cancer cells; this option can provide the patient with symptomatic relief, slow the progression of tumor growth, and help avoid complications from the tumor.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Natu&#173;ral products, meaning agents that &#173;either are naturally occurring or have been synthetically modified, have played a significant role in cancer chemotherapy and include a variety of agents, the most common of which are alkylating agents, antimetabolites, plant alkaloids, and antitumor antibiotics (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;13-3</span>).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Angiogenesis Inhibitors</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Angiogenesis is impor&#173;tant to the growth and spread of cancers, as new blood vessels are critical to tumor formation. In animal studies, angiogenesis inhibitors have successfully stopped the formation of new blood vessels, causing tumors to shrink and die. Vari&#173;ous angiogenesis inhibitors have been evaluated in &#173;human clinical &#173;trials. Participants in &#173;these studies include patients with cancers of the breast, prostate, brain, pancreas, lung, stomach, ovary, and cervix; patients with certain leukemias and lymphomas; and &#173;those with AIDS-&#173;related Kaposi sarcoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Antibodies against vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF), which promotes vascular proliferation, have proved effective in cancer therapy. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF-&#173;A, was the first angiogenesis inhibitor approved for the treatment of cancer in the United States. It has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of colorectal and other solid tumors and, on an off-&#173;label basis, in the treatment of neovascular (“wet”) age-&#173;related macular degeneration (AMD). Bevacizumab is also effective in the treatment of optic nerve gliomas in &#173;children. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including pazopanib, have also shown promise in antitumor activity use; TKIs interfere with the modulation of growth &#173;factor signaling and thus inhibit angiogenesis. Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that functions as a decoy receptor for VEGF. This agent inactivates VEGF-&#173;A, VEGF-&#173;B, and placental growth &#173;factor and is effective in the treatment of colorectal cancer and neovascular AMD.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Biologic Therapies</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Biologic therapies (sometimes called <span class="italic">immunotherapy, biotherapy,</span> or <span class="italic">biologic response </span><span class="italic">modifier therapy</span>) do not target cancer cells directly but rather harness the immune system, &#173;either directly or indirectly, to fight cancer or to lessen the adverse effects that may be caused by some cancer treatments. Further, &#173;because cancer may develop when the immune system breaks down or is not functioning adequately, biologic therapies are &#173;designed to repair, stimulate, or enhance the immune system’s responses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cells in the immune system secrete 2&#160;types of proteins: antibodies and cytokines. Cytokines are nonantibody proteins produced by some immune system cells to communicate with other cells. Types of cytokines include lymphokines, interferons, interleukins, and colony-&#173;stimulating &#173;factors. Some antibodies and cytokines, called <span class="italic">biologic response modifiers,</span> can be used in the treatment of cancer. Other biologic response modifiers include monoclonal antibodies, which can also be used to treat cancer, and vaccines.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Interleukins</span> occur naturally in the body and can also be made in the laboratory. Many interleukins have been identified; interleukin-2 has been the most widely studied for use in cancer treatment. Interleukin-2 stimulates the growth and activity of many immune cells (eg, lymphocytes) that can destroy cancer cells. The FDA has approved interleukin-2 for the treatment of metastatic kidney cancer and metastatic melanoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Colony-&#173;stimulating &#173;factors</span> (sometimes called <span class="italic">hematopoietic growth &#173;factors</span>) usually do not directly affect tumor cells but instead stimulate bone marrow production. Colony-&#173;stimulating &#173;factors allow doses of anticancer drugs to be increased without increasing the risk of infection or need for transfusion.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)</span> are produced by a single type of cell and are specific for a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar antigen. Researchers continue to examine ways to create mAbs that are specific for the antigens found on the surface of cancer cells being treated. Some examples of mAbs currently used in cancer treatment are rituximab and trastuzumab; note that the suffix for the names of all monoclonal antibodies is “-&#173;mab.”</p>
			<p class="body-text">Therapeutic mAbs are made by injecting &#173;human cancer cells into mice, which stimulates an antibody response. The cells producing antibodies are then removed and fused with laboratory-&#173;grown cells to create hybrid cells called <span class="italic">hybridomas.</span> Hybridomas can produce large quantities of &#173;these mAbs in&#173;def&#173;initely.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Monoclonal antibodies have many potential uses in cancer treatment; for example, they could be linked to anticancer drugs, radioisotopes, other biologic response modifiers, or other toxins. When &#173;these antibodies attach to cancer cells, they are able to deliver &#173;these poisons directly to the cells. One example of this is ado-&#173;trastuzumab emtansine, which uses trastuzumab to deliver a cytotoxic microtubule inhibitor. Another is tositumomab radioconjugate, which delivers specifically targeted radiotherapy to tumors. Monoclonal antibodies carry&#173;ing radioisotopes may also prove useful in the diagnosis of certain cancers, such as colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancer.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cancer treatment vaccines</span> are being developed to help the immune system recognize cancer cells. &#173;These vaccines are designed to be injected &#173;after the disease is diagnosed rather than before it develops, in contrast to the vaccines against HPV or hepatitis B, which are aimed at cancer prevention. The cancer treatment vaccines may help the body reject tumors and prevent recurrence. The first treatment vaccine, which was approved in 2010, was customized to each patient for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. In 2015, an oncolytic virus treatment vaccine was approved to treat melanoma that cannot be surgically removed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other biologic approaches to cancer therapy include <span class="italic">ge&#173;ne&#173;tic profiling</span> of certain &#173;tumors. Current management of lung cancer and melanoma is based on such profiling. Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic profiling may also prove more helpful and effective than classifying tumors by their organ of origin. An example of this is the differentiation between &#173;those tumors with a normal tumor suppressor gene p53 from &#173;those with an abnormal tumor suppressor gene p53. Tumor cells with normal p53&#160;genes are far more sensitive to chemotherapy than &#173;those with mutant p53.</p>

Breast and lung cancers frequently metastasize to the eye and are the most common intraocular tumors in adults. Acute myelogenous and lymphocytic leukemias often have uveal and posterior choroidal infiltrates as part of their generalized disease. In &#173;children, &#173;these manifestations are often signs of central ner&#173;vous system involvement and suggest a poor prognosis. Although malignant lymphomas do not usually involve the uveal tract, histiocytic lymphoma often involves the vitreous and pres&#173;ents as uveitis.
