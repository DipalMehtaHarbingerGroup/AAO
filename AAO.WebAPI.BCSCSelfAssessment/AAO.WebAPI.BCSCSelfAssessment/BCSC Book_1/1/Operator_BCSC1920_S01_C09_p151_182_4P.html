			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The rheumatic disorders are a heterogeneous collection of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases that include rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, connective tissue diseases, and the vasculitides. Ocular involvement is common in autoimmune diseases, but its prevalence and manifestations vary among the dif&#173;fer&#173;ent disorders. Ophthalmologists should be familiar with &#173;these conditions, their potential for ocular involvement, and the pharmacotherapy used. If a patient has been diagnosed with a rheumatic disorder, it is impor&#173;tant for the ophthalmologist and the rheumatologist to communicate and to coordinate management. Treatment of rheumatic diseases commonly involves systemic anti-&#173;inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapy, some of which have ocular effects. Drug therapy is discussed at the end of this chapter.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Rheumatoid Arthritis</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)</span> is the most common rheumatic disorder, affecting approximately 1% of adults worldwide, and is 3 times more likely to occur in &#173;women than in men. RA is classically a progressive, symmetric, and deforming peripheral polyarthritis characterized by synovial inflammation and hypertrophy as well as autoantibody production. Although it can involve any joint, RA primarily affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Typically, affected joints are swollen and tender, with decreased range of motion and deformity from bone and cartilage destruction. Hand deformities (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-1</span>) include nodules, ulnar deviation, Boutonni<span class="accent">è</span>re deformity (abnormally flexed proximal interphalangeal [PIP] joint and extended distal interphalangeal [DIP] joint), and swan-&#173;neck deformity (abnormally hyperextended PIP and flexed DIP). Early diagnosis and treatment are critical in controlling the joint damage and associated disability.</p>
			<p class="h2">Extra-&#173;articular Manifestations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Extra-&#173;articular involvement, which is an indicator of disease severity, occurs in about 40% of RA patients over the course of the illness. Risk &#173;factors for systemic involvement include the presence of rheumatoid &#173;factor (RF), anti–&#173;cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies, and smoking. RA can affect almost all systems; manifestations include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules (in approximately 25% of patients)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">anemia of chronic disease (common in RA patients)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">increased risk of lymphoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Felty syndrome (seropositive RA, neutropenia, and splenomegaly)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">osteopenia and a higher risk of fractures</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">pleural effusions, pulmonary nodules, and interstitial fibrosis</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">cardiac disease (coronary artery disease, pericarditis and effusions, valvular disease from rheumatoid nodules, and cardiomyopathy from secondary amyloid deposition)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">peripheral vascular disease and vasculitis (small-&#173; to medium-&#173;sized vessels)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">carpal tunnel syndrome (from synovitis, compressive myelopathy, or radiculopathy)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">muscle weakness (primary or drug-&#173;induced myopathy)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular involvement may include dry eye disease, scleritis, episcleritis, and corneal inflammation, melting, and infection. The ocular manifestations of RA are discussed in BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;8,</span> <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>, and <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;9,</span> <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation</span>.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Laboratory Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Serologic testing is impor&#173;tant in the workup and diagnosis of RA. <span class="italic">Rheumatoid &#173;factor (RF)</span> is pres&#173;ent in 70%–80% of patients. However, it has limited specificity for the disease, as it can be positive in up to 10% of unaffected individuals and in about one-&#173;third of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). <span class="italic">Anti-&#173;CCP antibody</span> is as sensitive as RF but has a higher specificity for RA (98%). Nevertheless, both of &#173;these tests may be negative in up to 50% of RA patients. Similarly, <span class="italic">anti–&#173;mutated citrullinated vimentin (anti-&#173;MCV) antibody</span> testing shows high specificity for the disease. <span class="italic">Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)</span> and <span class="italic">C-&#173;reactive protein (CRP)</span> levels are usually elevated. <span class="italic">Antinuclear antibody (ANA)</span> testing is nonspecific, &#173;because only 30% of RA patients have positive results, but it can help exclude other diseases such as SLE. Although ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing is not performed routinely, the <span class="italic">HLA-&#173;DRB1</span> gene appears to be the strongest known ge&#173;ne&#173;tic risk &#173;factor for the development of RA.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of RA involves an integrated approach, incorporating medi&#173;cations and nondrug therapies. Nonpharmacologic interventions include dietary counseling, exercise, physical therapy, smoking cessation, lipid control (to reduce the associated cardiovascular risks), and immunizations (to reduce the risk of infection linked with the use of immunosuppressive agents).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ultimate goal of pharmacologic treatment (discussed in detail <span class="xref-local">at the end of this chapter</span>) is disease remission. Early diagnosis and treatment are imperative in preventing or delaying the long-&#173;term effects of disease progression. Mild symptoms of joint stiffness and pain can be treated with analgesics and <span class="italic">nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs </span><span class="italic">(NSAIDs)</span>, although &#173;these agents do not alter the long-&#173;term prognosis. <span class="italic">Glucocorticoids</span> are sometimes helpful in controlling the acute stages of inflammation; severe cases may require sustained low-&#173;dose therapy (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>10&#160;mg/day).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Disease-&#173;modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)</span>, which are divided into nonbiologic and biologic agents, have been shown to slow disease progression, reduce potential joint destruction, and maintain joint function while also limiting the need for long-&#173;term ste&#173;roid use. In addition to their anti-&#173;inflammatory effect, &#173;these drugs reduce the body’s heightened autoimmune reaction. Thus, the clinician should consider screening for pre&#173;existing infectious conditions such as hepatitis B and C and tuberculosis. Among <span class="italic">non</span><span class="italic">biologic agents,</span> methotrexate is generally the first-&#173;line treatment, but other options are available. <span class="italic">Biologic agents,</span> developed through ge&#173;ne&#173;tic engineering, are modified proteins that can target cytokines. The largest group of currently available agents consists of anti–&#173;tumor necrosis &#173;factor (TNF)-&#173;<span class="greek--tx-">a</span> inhibitors. Other biologics act by blocking interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 receptors or in modifying T-&#173;cell or B-&#173;cell activity. One emerging group of DMARDs, which are technically small-&#173;molecule drugs as opposed to true biologic agents, targets the inhibition of the Janus kinase (JAK) enzyme involved in mediating inflammation.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Spondyloarthropathies</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Spondyloarthritis (SpA)</span> represents a spectrum of HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;related rheumatic diseases that have a predilection for axial (spinal and sacro&#173;iliac joint) inflammation. The predominant symptom is low back pain, but a small subset of patients lacks axial symptoms and has primary peripheral disease characterized by pain and swelling in the arms and legs. Males are affected 2–3 times more often than females. Among &#173;these diseases are ankylosing spondylitis (AS), reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and the enteropathic arthropathies linked to inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease). Syndromes that do not clearly fall into one of &#173;these categories and show no x-&#173;ray evidence of sacroiliitis are sometimes referred to as <span class="italic">nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis.</span> What distinguishes SpA, in general, from other forms of arthritis is its tendency to cause inflammation in the ligaments and tendons that insert onto bone (<span class="italic">enthesitis</span>); the heel or Achilles tendon are common targets. Other features include asymmetric oligoarthritis and inflammation of fin&#173;gers or toes (<span class="italic">dactylitis</span>), giving the appearance of “sausage digits.” Axial radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacro&#173;iliac joints can be helpful, although abnormalities are not always pres&#173;ent in the early course of the disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Spondyloarthritis may occur in childhood, although it is rare before the second de&#173;cade of life. The <span class="italic">juvenile-&#173;onset spondyloarthropathies</span> are generally classified as a type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis known as <span class="italic">enthesitis-&#173;related arthritis.</span> &#173;Because the radiographic findings are similar, SpA is sometimes misdiagnosed as the result of trauma. As in adults, most young patients are HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;positive, and more males than females seem to be affected. &#173;These patients may develop acute uveitis characteristic of HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;positive uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ophthalmologists should be familiar with &#173;these diseases, as acute recurrent HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;associated anterior uveitis may be the presenting feature of SpA (see <span class="xref-local">“Ophthalmic considerations”</span>). With appropriate referral of suspected patients, early disease can be recognized and treated to limit &#173;future morbidity. See BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;9,</span> <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation</span>, for further discussion of the ophthalmic manifestations.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Ankylosing Spondylitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)</span> is the most common type of axial SpA. The cause is unknown, but the strong association with HLA-&#173;B27 (positive in 90% of patients with AS) suggests a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic predisposition. The disease occurs most commonly in young men. Low back pain with limitation in spinal mobility is typical; complete spinal fusion may develop in &#173;later stages. Peripheral arthritis may also be pres&#173;ent, most frequently affecting the ankles, hips, and knees. Extra-&#173;articular features of AS include a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism, stroke, and restrictive pulmonary disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">NSAIDs are often the first-&#173;line treatment and are very effective, with 70%–80% of patients reporting significant improvement in symptoms. TNF-&#173;<span class="greek--tx-">a</span> inhibitors appear to be effective as a second-&#173;line treatment; most clinicians consider their use &#173;after failure of 2 separate NSAID &#173;trials. Nonbiologic DMARDs (eg, sulfasalazine or methotrexate) tend to work better for peripheral arthritis than for primary axial disease. Local glucocorticoid injection is helpful in some patients.</p>
			<p class="h2">Reactive Arthritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Reactive arthritis</span> is an unusual form of SpA that occurs following an infection, usually originating in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary systems, and most commonly affects young adults, both men and &#173;women. The infectious agents associated with this disease include <span class="italic">Chlamydia trachomatis</span> in the genitourinary tract and <span class="italic">Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia,</span> or <span class="italic">Campylobacter</span> in the gastrointestinal tract. Other microbes, including <span class="italic">Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile,</span> and <span class="italic">Chlamydia pneumoniae</span> have recently been added to the list of causative agents. HLA-&#173;B27 and ge&#173;ne&#173;tics appear to be involved in susceptibility to developing reactive arthritis &#173;after an infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The arthritic symptoms typically have their onset from days to weeks &#173;after the antecedent infection. The arthritis is aseptic, as no microbes have been identified in the joints. Joint involvement is typically asymmetric and episodic, primarily affecting the knees and ankles. In addition to a preceding urethritis or diarrhea, extra-&#173;articular findings may include enthesitis (often of the knees and ankles), dactylitis of the fin&#173;gers and toes (“sausage digits”), and sacroiliitis. Oral ulceration, nail pitting, and the skin eruptions of keratoderma blennorrhagicum (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-2</span>) and erythema nodosum (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-3</span>) can also occur. Ocular findings may be pres&#173;ent in up to 40% of patients (see <span class="xref-local">“Ophthalmic considerations”</span>). Historically, the term <span class="italic">Reiter syndrome</span> was used to describe the clinical triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis. However, individuals with all 3 findings represent only a small subset of patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The disease is often episodic, and most patients go into remission within 2&#160;years. Any under&#173;lying infection should be treated with appropriate antibiotics. In most patients, NSAIDs are effective in managing inflammation. For refractory symptoms, glucocorticoid injection into inflamed joints or, more rarely, the use of biologic agents is sometimes necessary.</p>
			<p class="h2">Enteropathic Arthritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Spondyloarthritis may occur in association with <span class="italic">inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),</span> of which ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease represent the majority of cases. Males and &#173;females are equally affected, although spondylitis is more common in men, and onset can be from childhood to adulthood. <span class="italic">Ulcerative colitis</span> is characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal mucosa with diffuse involvement of the colon. <span class="italic">Crohn disease,</span> also known as <span class="italic">regional enteritis, granulomatous ileocolitis,</span> or <span class="italic">granulomatous colitis,</span> is a focal granulomatous disease that can affect both the large and small intestines. Symptoms of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease include diarrhea (with or without bleeding) and cramping abdominal pain. Arthritis tends to occur more frequently in patients with large-&#173;bowel involvement or with extraenteric findings such as erythema nodosum (<span class="xref-local">see Fig 9-3</span>), stomatitis, or uveitis. HLA-&#173;B27 prevalence is as high as 75% in patients with axial involvement and is somewhat lower in &#173;those with primarily peripheral disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Radiographic findings of axial involvement are similar to &#173;those of AS but are of limited value in diagnosing early disease. MRI may also be helpful in demonstrating abnormal axial and sacro&#173;iliac findings in symptomatic patients. Elevated acute phase reactants, including ESR and CRP, often indicate heightened gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation but have limited benefit in assessing peripheral arthritis or spondylitis activity.</p>
			<p class="h2">Psoriatic Arthritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The skin disease psoriasis can be associated with SpA. Psoriatic arthritis has vari&#173;ous pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions, including oligoarthritis (up to 4 joints), distal polyarthritis (more than 4 joints), and a more destructive type of arthritis known as <span class="italic">arthritis mutilans.</span> The prevalence of HLA-&#173;B27 is higher in &#173;these patients than in the general population (30% versus 6%), although not as high as in AS (90%). The course of the disease varies, but it is often similar to the progression seen with RA. Over half of individuals who have the disease for more than 10&#160;years develop deforming arthritis in 5 or more joints. Although methotrexate is sometimes initially used for treatment, biologics and JAK inhibitors appear to be more effective in controlling disease progression.</p>

A small percentage of patients presenting with idiopathic acute anterior uveitis have undiagnosed SpA. Up to 40% of patients with &#173;either AS or reactive arthritis develop the typical manifestations of acute nongranulomatous iridocyclitis, which can be recurrent and bilateral. Ocular involvement tends not to correlate with the activity of the joint disease.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text--last-">Culture-&#173;negative bilateral conjunctivitis, which is typically self-&#173;limited, is also a common manifestation of reactive arthritis. IBD is more frequently associated with episcleritis. Uveitis pres&#173;ents in up to 3% of IBD patients, is significantly more common in females, and is not linked to the activity of the under&#173;lying disease. Ocular involvement with psoriatic arthritis is similar to that of other types of SpA, although the uveitis can be more insidious, posterior, and bilateral.

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)</span> has replaced the older name, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, &#173;because the disease has no direct relationship with adult-&#173;onset RA. Girls are affected more often than boys by a 3:1 ratio. Age of onset tends to be younger for girls (1–4&#160;years) than for boys (8–10&#160;years), and JIA is somewhat less common in African American and Asian populations than in white populations. As with many other auto&#173;immune disorders, the pathogenesis of JIA is unclear.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although classification of JIA has always been challenging, the International League of Associations for Rheumatology divides JIA into the 5 categories shown in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;9-1</span>. Ocular involvement is most common in the oligoarticular group, less common in the polyarticular group, and least common in the systemic group. Patients with oligoarticular or polyarticular (especially RF-&#173;negative subtype) disease should be periodically screened for ocular involvement &#173;because it is often asymptomatic. Furthermore, a positive ANA in &#173;either of &#173;these 2 groups is associated with an increased risk of developing uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Systemic JIA</span> may pres&#173;ent with variable onset of intermittent fever, arthritis, macular skin rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, pericarditis, and pulmonary effusions. Although laboratory findings of elevated ESR, CRP, and thrombocytosis are usual, ANA and RF are rarely pres&#173;ent. The arthritis can involve any number of joints. Ocular involvement is not typical for this form of JIA.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The last 2 subtypes, <span class="italic">psoriatic arthritis</span> and <span class="italic">enthesitis-&#173;related arthritis</span>, &#173;were added to help in categorizing patients who did not fit into more common entities. Uveitis can occur in both of &#173;these subtypes.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</span> is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease of undetermined cause that pres&#173;ents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and can involve any organ. It is characterized by remissions and relapses, from mild to severe. The disease is estimated to affect 1.5 million &#173;people in the United States. &#173;Women are affected far more frequently than men, and the median age of onset is between 35 and 50&#160;years. Individuals of African, Asian, and Native American heritage are more likely than white individuals to develop SLE. It is associated with B-&#173;cell hyperactivity, hypergammaglobulinemia, and a plethora of autoantibodies. &#173;These include antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) as well as antibodies to DNA and cytoplasmic components. SLE has classically been considered an immune complex disease that leads to an inflammatory response and tissue damage.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Signs and Symptoms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients may pres&#173;ent with single-&#173;organ involvement, such as nephritis, or with a multisystem disease. The characteristic cutaneous manifestation of SLE is the <span class="italic">butterfly rash</span> (or <span class="italic">malar rash</span>) across the nose and cheeks, which appears in 70%–80% of patients (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-4</span>). Other cutaneous manifestations include discoid lesions, which often lead to scarring, and alopecia. Mucosal lesions, usually painless oral or nasal ulcers, are pres&#173;ent in up to 40% of patients. Acute or chronic photosensitivity occurs in many patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Approximately 90% of SLE patients experience articular disease, as &#173;either a poly&#173;arthralgia or a nondeforming migratory polyarthritis. Constitutional symptoms, such as fatigue, fever, myalgia, and weight loss, are common. Renal disease affects approximately 50% of patients; it can pres&#173;ent with a range of manifestations from hematuria, proteinuria, and nephrotic syndrome to fulminant glomerulonephritis and renal failure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Raynaud phenomenon occurs in up to 50% of patients with SLE (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-5</span>). Anemia of chronic disease is common, along with reduction in leukocytes and platelets. The rate of coronary artery disease is significantly greater in SLE patients than in unaffected individuals. Other, less common cardiac manifestations include pericarditis, myocarditis, and Libman-&#173;Sacks endocarditis. Valvular disease has been reported in more than 50% of patients. Thromboembolism is more common in SLE, especially in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. Pulmonary involvement includes pleuritis, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension. Gastrointestinal manifestations are varied and include dysphagia, esophagitis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis (GI symptoms are sometimes related to medi&#173;cations). Central ner&#173;vous system (CNS) involvement occurs in more than one-&#173;third of patients, and symptoms are typically transient. The most common pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions of neurologic lupus are headache, cognitive impairment, seizures, psychosis, and peripheral neuropathy. <span class="xref-local">See “Ophthalmic considerations”</span> for ocular manifestations.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;9-2</span> lists the classification criteria developed by an international SLE study group. Although this schema is intended primarily for research purposes, clinicians have found it useful in diagnosing and documenting the disease. Patients must satisfy at least 4 of the 17 criteria, including at least 1 clinical and 1 immunologic criterion. Alternatively, SLE can be diagnosed in patients with biopsy-&#173;proven nephritis with positive ANA or anti–&#173;double-&#173;stranded DNA (anti-&#173;dsDNA) antibodies. More recently, the British Society for Rheumatology released new UK-&#173;based guidelines for the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of nonrenal manifestations of SLE (<span class="xref-local">referenced in the Treatment section</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">ANA testing should be ordered for suspected cases of SLE, as virtually all patients with SLE have positive titers of 1:160 or higher. Lower ANA titers limit the test specificity, as up to a third of unaffected individuals have a titer of 1:40. Thus, testing should be reserved for cases of high clinical suspicion. Three other immunologic tests that are highly specific for SLE are anti-&#173;dsDNA, anti-&#173;Smith (anti-&#173;Sm), and antiphospholipid antibodies. The presence of any 1 of &#173;these is considered an acceptable immunologic criterion. Additionally, antiribosomal P protein antibodies have a high specificity and can be helpful when the diagnosis is uncertain. Several other autoantibodies (anti-&#173;Ro/SS-&#173;A, anti-&#173;La/SS-&#173;B, anti-&#173;RNP, and anti-&#173;RA33) may indicate a predisposition to SLE or other autoimmune disease, but they are not included within the classification system.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The treatment of SLE depends on disease severity. It can have a varied clinical course, ranging from a relatively benign illness to fulminant organ failure and death. Most patients have a relapsing and remitting course that requires frequent titration of medi&#173;cations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nonpharmacologic mea&#173;sures include sun protection to address photosensitivity, smoking cessation to reduce cardiovascular risks, and immunizations to decrease infection risk (if immunosuppressive agents are used). The most commonly prescribed medi&#173;cation is hydroxychloroquine. Alternatively, treatment may include NSAIDs, glucocorticoids (preferably low dose and short term), and immunosuppressive drugs. If antiphospholipid antibodies are pres&#173;ent, low-&#173;dose aspirin appears to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Refractory cases of SLE and severe disease with CNS involvement may require high-&#173;dose pulse therapy with glucocorticoids and belimumab or rituximab, which have been shown to modulate B-&#173;cell activity.</p>

Females have more frequent skin and ocular manifestations, while males have a higher incidence of cardiac involvement. Cutaneous findings are variable and include vari&#173;ous papules, plaques, and nodules, such as the painful nodules of erythema nodosum. Arthropathy occurs in 10%–15% of affected individuals.

Eye involvement can include any periocular structure (skin, orbit, lacrimal gland, and muscles) as well as anterior and posterior segments. Uveitis and retinitis associated with sarcoidosis are discussed in greater detail in BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;9,</span> <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation,</span> and <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;12,</span> <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous,</span> respectively.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Histopathology is valuable in confirming the diagnosis whenever pos&#173;si&#173;ble, and common sites include lung, lymph node, skin, liver, and bone marrow. Pathology reveals granulomatous inflammation (usually noncaseating). In 3 situations, however, a diagnosis can be reasonably established without biopsy: L<span class="accent">ö</span>fgren syndrome (erythema nodosum, hilar adenopathy, migratory polyarthralgia, and fever), Heerfordt-&#173;Waldenstr<span class="accent">ö</span>m syndrome &#173;(parotid gland swelling, facial nerve palsy, uveitis, and fever), and asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy. Biopsy of erythema nodosum skin lesions is not helpful, as granulomas are not associated with the eruption.</p>
			<p class="body-text">No serologic test is pathognomonic for sarcoidosis. Although serum angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme (ACE) is elevated in 75% of patients, poor sensitivity and reduced specificity limit its usefulness. Pulmonary imaging is helpful and may include radi&#173;o&#173;graphy, computed tomography, or positron-&#173;emission tomography scans. An ophthalmologic exam is impor&#173;tant as part of the workup of any patient suspected of having sarcoidosis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with asymptomatic disease often do not require treatment. Spontaneous remission is common for mild disease. For patients with more extensive manifestations, treatment is tailored to the affected systems. Glucocorticoids are typically the first line of treatment, and maintenance doses are sometimes required for years. For refractory cases, DMARDs are sometimes employed.

			<div id="Chapt9_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)</span> is an autoimmune disorder that predisposes patients to arterial or venous thrombosis. It occurs as a primary condition or in association with other autoimmune diseases, especially SLE.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Signs and Symptoms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Deep venous thrombosis is the most common type of thrombosis, occurring in approximately one-&#173;third of patients with APS. Episodes of thrombosis can recur, particularly in patients with high antiphospholipid antibody titers. Patients may also have pulmonary embolism and superficial thrombophlebitis. CNS disease can include strokes, transient ischemic attacks, dementia, and even psychosis. APS should be considered when thrombosis or cerebrovascular disease occurs in a young patient without other risk &#173;factors for stroke.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This syndrome can cause complications during pregnancy. Patients may have multiple first-&#173;trimester spontaneous abortions and premature births due to preeclampsia or placental insufficiency; late-&#173;term fetal death may also occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other manifestations of APS include thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, nephropathy, and livedo reticularis. Cardiac manifestations include valvular thickening and nodules (<span class="italic">Libman-&#173;Sacks endocarditis</span>). In rare instances, a severe form of APS can occur with multiple vessel occlusions and multiorgan failure. This form of the disease is called <span class="italic">catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome</span> and has a mortality rate of 48%.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In patients suspected of having APS, immunoassays are performed to detect the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-&#173;<span class="greek--tx-">b</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> glycoprotein antibodies, and lupus anticoagulants. Additional testing for under&#173;lying autoimmune disease in newly diagnosed APS patients should be considered &#173;because SLE, in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, is pres&#173;ent in up to 36% of cases.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Therapy for thrombosis usually consists of heparin, followed by warfarin. The optimal duration of treatment is not known: some experts believe that anticoagulation can be discontinued if the antiphospholipid antibody titers decrease, but lifelong treatment is recommended for patients with recurrent disease. Associated autoimmune disorders are often treated with such drugs as hydroxychloroquine to help reduce risk of APS complications. Treatment of pregnant patients remains controversial; it may include some combination of heparin or low-&#173;molecular-&#173;weight heparin and aspirin, as warfarin is teratogenic. Patients with antiphospholipid antibodies without a history of thrombosis may benefit from prophylactic aspirin. The use of autologous stem cell transplantation or rituximab has been investigated, but the benefits remain questionable.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-11">Systemic Sclerosis</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top9">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Systemic sclerosis (SSc),</span> formerly known as scleroderma, is a relatively uncommon connective tissue disorder characterized by fibrous and degenerative changes in the skin and other organ systems. The term <span class="italic">scleroderma</span> is often used for sclerosis affecting only the skin. SSc is further classified into <span class="italic">limited</span> and <span class="italic">diffuse</span> subtypes, depending mainly on the extent of skin involvement. The etiology of this disease is poorly understood but involves activation of fibroblasts that produce excessive collagen deposition, inflammation, and fibrosis. SSc is 4 times more common in &#173;women than in men, with age of onset typically in the third or fourth de&#173;cade of life. African American individuals seem to be more prone to the diffuse form of the disease, although it can affect other groups as well. The limited form of SSc rarely involves internal organs and has a better prognosis, often with a normal life span. It is frequently associated with the <span class="italic">CREST syndrome</span> (<span class="italic">c</span>alcinosis, <span class="italic">R</span>aynaud phenomenon, <span class="italic">e</span>sophageal involvement, <span class="italic">s</span>clerodactyly, and <span class="italic">t</span>elangiectasia).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Signs and Symptoms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The hallmark of SSc is changes to the skin, namely thickening, tightening, and induration, with subsequent loss of mobility and contracture (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-6</span>). The disease usually begins peripherally, in the fin&#173;gers and hands, and subsequently spreads centripetally up the arms to involve the face and body. Telangiectasia and calcinosis are common. Vascular effects also occur; more than 95% of SSc patients experience Raynaud phenomenon (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig 9-5</span>). Less frequently, permanent damage to blood vessels can result in digital ulcers and ischemia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Organ involvement is pres&#173;ent in more than 90% of patients; the most common is esophageal dysmotility with gastroesophageal reflux secondary to stricture formation and submucosal fibrosis. The small and large intestines may also be affected, with decreased motility, malabsorption, and diverticulosis. Cardiopulmonary disease is manifested primarily by pulmonary vascular fibrosis leading to restrictive lung disease and decreased diffusing capacity, pulmonary hypertension, and right-&#173;sided heart failure. &#173;These complications, along with arrhythmias arising from cardiac fibrosis, account for a cumulative &#173;5-&#173;year survival rate around 75% from the time of diagnosis. Musculoskeletal characteristics include polyarthralgias, tendon friction rubs, and occasionally myositis. Renal disease is seen in approximately 50% of patients.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The &#173;great majority of patients with SSc test positive for ANA. Other useful serological tests include anti-&#173;DNA topoisomerase I and anti-&#173;RNA polymerase III, which are highly specific for the disease. Anticentromere antibody is often pres&#173;ent in the limited subtype of SSc. &#173;These specific serologies help classify the disease and vari&#173;ous syndromes that overlap with SSc.</p>
			<p class="h2">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment is aimed at controlling prob&#173;lems in the specific organ systems involved. Several agents in the antihypertensive class of endothelin-1 receptor antagonists are sometimes beneficial in patients with pulmonary hypertension. ACE inhibitors are recommended for the treatment of hypertension due to renal disease. Patients with Raynaud phenomenon are treated with calcium channel blockers. Immunosuppressive agents, including methotrexate and cyclophosphamide, have proved effective in the treatment of diffuse SSc cutaneous manifestations and may slow the progression of disease. Management of inflammatory joint disease is similar to that of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

Mild anemia across all cell lines is found in approximately 20% of patients, and the overall risk of non-&#173;Hodgkin lymphoma is increased.

Both disorders are associated with polyarthritis, dysphagia, and interstitial pulmonary disease. Ocular involvement is relatively uncommon, apart from the heliotrope rash of dermatomyositis, which is very specific but not often pres&#173;ent &#173;(<span class="xref-figure">Fig </span><span class="xref-figure">9-7</span>). In rare cases, the extraocular muscles may be involved, resulting in ophthalmoplegia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Dermatomyositis is distinguished from polymyositis by the presence of cutaneous &#173;lesions. &#173;These skin lesions appear as an erythematous to violaceous rash variably affecting the eyelids (<span class="italic">heliotrope rash</span>; see <span class="xref-local">Fig 9-7</span>), cheeks, nose, chest (<span class="italic">V-&#173;neck sign</span>), and extensor surfaces (<span class="italic">Gottron sign</span>).

			<p class="body-text">Glucocorticoids are typically initiated at the time of diagnosis and are usually tapered over a period of 9–12 months. Immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine or methotrexate, are sometimes used in patients unresponsive to ste&#173;roid treatment or in &#173;those who develop adverse effects.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Polymyalgia Rheumatica</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top12">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)</span> is a relatively common chronic inflammatory condition affecting older adults that is characterized by proximal myalgia and morning stiffness of the neck, shoulders, and hip girdle. Among rheumatic conditions in adults, the lifetime risk of this disease is second only to rheumatoid arthritis. PMR is significant for its association with &#173;giant cell arteritis (GCA), which approximately 10% of PMR patients &#173;will develop. Similarly, up to 50% of patients diagnosed with GCA have manifestations of PMR. Although the etiology of both is unclear, many believe that the 2 entities share a common pathophysiology. &#173;People of Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean descent are at greatest risk, while &#173;those of Asian, Latino, and African American heritage are the least susceptible.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The onset of symptoms can be abrupt. They are most noticeable upon arising from bed in the morning; in fact, the absence of morning stiffness helps to exclude the diagnosis. Associated synovitis can limit range of motion in affected joints: the classic finding in a patient with PMR is the inability to raise the arms above 90°. ESR and CRP are often elevated. Patients with PMR should be asked about symptoms typical of GCA. Temporal artery biopsy is not indicated in patients without signs and symptoms of GCA, as it rarely yields positive results.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prednisone typically brings dramatic relief in 2–3 days, with complete recovery often occurring within 3 weeks. Patients without relapses can usually be tapered off by 1 year. If patients need longer-&#173;term treatment, methotrexate may be helpful in reducing the ste&#173;roid requirement. Other biologics have not shown consistent results.</p>

			<div id="Chapt9_Top13">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Relapsing polychondritis</span> is a rare, episodic autoimmune disorder characterized by widespread, potentially destructive inflammation of cartilage throughout the body, including ears (most commonly involved), nose, cardiac and respiratory structures, joints, and eye. Males and females of all ages and races can be affected, although white individuals seem more susceptible. The disease is variable in duration and severity. Nasal bridge involvement can pro&#173;gress to cause &#173;saddle nose deformity from cartilage collapse. Laryngotracheobronchial disease may be insidious but can lead to the fatal complication of laryngeal collapse. Involvement of the inner ear, cardiovascular system, and skin is less common. Cardiovascular prob&#173;lems include aortic insufficiency (due to progressive dilation of the aortic root) and vasculitis. Skin lesions are most often caused by cutaneous vasculitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In up to one-&#173;third of patients, relapsing polychondritis can be associated with other connective tissue diseases (eg, SLE or RA), systemic vasculitis, or malignancy. Ocular manifestations, which occur in up to 60% of patients, include episcleritis, scleritis, uveitis, and, rarely, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment focuses on reducing symptoms and preserving the integrity of cartilaginous structures. Pharmacotherapy includes systemic corticosteroids, dapsone, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. Patients may require surgical interventions such as tracheostomy, aortic aneurysm repair, and cardiac valve replacement.</p>

			<div id="Chapt9_Top14">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The systemic vasculitides are a group of diseases whose principal pathology involves autoimmune damage to blood vessels, which can result in ischemia and necrosis of supplied tissues. &#173;These diseases are grouped according to size and location of affected vessels. Vasculitis can occur as a primary disease state or as a secondary condition associated with other immune disorders or with exogenous &#173;factors such as infection, neoplasia, or medi&#173;cation. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;9-3</span> outlines the most recent classification created by the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference on &#173;these diseases.

Other names include <span class="italic">aortic arch arteritis, aortitis syndrome,</span> and <span class="italic">pulseless disease.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">This disease may involve the entire aorta or be localized to any segment of the aorta or its primary branches. The inflammatory pro&#173;cess is characterized by panarteritis with granulomatous inflammation. The involved vessels may ultimately become narrowed or obliterated, resulting in ischemia of the supplied tissues. Areas of weakened vascular walls may develop dissections or aneurysms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic features such as fatigue, headache, weight loss, and low-&#173;grade fever are common. Evidence of vascular insufficiency due to large-&#173;artery narrowing leads to the characteristic pulseless phase. Angiography, including magnetic resonance angiography, is essential in confirming the diagnosis. Treatment is generally with systemic corticosteroids, which may successfully suppress the disease. Cyclophosphamide or methotrexate is added in resistant cases. Surgical reconstruction of stenotic vessels may be necessary.</p>

CNS lesions can also occur. Renal involvement is common and is often associated with hypertension due to glomerular ischemia. Gastrointestinal disease with infarction of the viscera is also common. PAN may be limited to a single organ, such as the appendix, uterus, or testes. Although most cases of PAN are idiopathic, hepatitis B and C viral infections as well as hairy cell leukemia have been linked to its onset. Biopsy of involved tissues or organs is helpful in confirming the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The mean age of onset of PAN is in the fifth and six de&#173;cades of life, with men affected more often than &#173;women. Survival in patients with untreated PAN is poor. However, most patients can be treated with a combination of corticosteroids and an immunosuppressive drug such as cyclophosphamide.

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Kawasaki disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Kawasaki disease</span>, also known as <span class="italic">mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome</span>, is a condition associated with inflammation in the walls of medium-&#173;sized vessels throughout the body. The disease typically affects infants and young &#173;children. Patients often develop a per&#173;sis&#173;tent high fever, swollen lymph nodes, bilateral conjunctivitis, and truncal rash. A characteristic feature of Kawasaki disease is <span class="italic">strawberry tongue</span>—an extremely red, swollen tongue.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the disease is typically self-&#173;limited, it can lead to associated cardiovas&#173;cular complications including coronary artery aneurysms, myocarditis, and dysrhythmias. Prompt treatment, which includes intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin, reduces the potential for long-&#173;term complications.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Small-&#173;Vessel Vasculitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Inflammation in small-&#173;vessel disease predominantly affects the arterioles, venules, and capillaries. This group of vasculitic disorders is further categorized based on the presence or relative absence of vessel-&#173;wall deposition of immunoglobulin and/or complement components. Subtypes include antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)–&#173;associated small-&#173;vessel vasculitis and immune complex small-&#173;vessel vasculitis.</p>

The disease strikes older adults and both sexes equally, with white individuals more commonly affected. The clinical features of GPA include granulomatous inflammation of the paranasal sinuses or nasopharyngeal tissues in a majority of cases. Glomerulonephritis occurs in up to 85% of patients and can be asymptomatic &#173;until &#173;later stages. Other findings include cutaneous vasculitis and, less commonly, neurovasculitis. Limited forms of the disease may occur without significant systemic involvement, making diagnosis difficult. Ocular disease, found in up to 50% of patients, may be the presenting feature. Ocular findings include scleritis with or without peripheral keratitis, idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease, and vasculitis-&#173;mediated ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular or neuro-&#173;ophthalmic lesions. Over 85% of patients with GPA are seropositive for ANCA. Histopathology remains the definitive way to confirm the diagnosis.

			<p class="body-text">Early and aggressive treatment of systemic GPA is critical, as the mortality rate of untreated severe disease approaches 90% within 2&#160;years of onset. Glucocorticoids in combination with &#173;either cyclophosphamide or rituximab are highly effective in inducing and maintaining remission of disease. Trimethoprim-&#173;sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis is sometimes used to help prevent opportunistic infections during treatment. Plasma exchange may be beneficial in severe cases with rapidly deteriorating renal or pulmonary function.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis</span> Formerly known as Churg-&#173;Strauss syndrome, <span class="italic">eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)</span> is a vasculitis of small-&#173; to medium-&#173;sized arteries characterized by chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, and eosinophilia. The cause is unknown. Average age of onset is between 50 and 60&#160;years, with no sex predominance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any organ can be affected, but the lungs and skin (tender subcutaneous nodules) are most commonly involved. Cardiovascular involvement is responsible for half of the deaths among affected patients. Peripheral mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy is common. Renal and gastrointestinal involvement is sometimes evident. Ophthalmic manifestations include conjunctival granulomas, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis and occlusion, uveitis, and cranial nerve palsies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnosis of EGPA depends on the presence of several criteria, including asthma, eosinophilia, eosinophilic vasculitis, transient pulmonary infiltrates, and neuropathy. Biopsy of tissue from the lung or a skin nodule is helpful in establishing the diagnosis; pathologic examination often shows granulomas with eosinophilic tissue infiltration of smaller vessels. ANCA titers are positive in about 50% of patients. Many patients achieve remission with glucocorticoids alone, although additional immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary in more severe cases.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Microscopic polyangiitis</span> <span class="italic">Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)</span> is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that is similar to GPA in targeting small vessels, and it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between the 2 entities. On histologic examination, however, MPA lacks the necrotizing granulomatous formation seen in GPA. Patients with MPA are also less likely to relapse. In both conditions, the majority of patients are ANCA-&#173;positive; but patients with GPA tend to have high proteinase 3 (PR3)-&#173;ANCA levels, whereas patients with MPA tend to have higher myeloperoxidase (MPO)-&#173;ANCA levels. Treatment of MPA is similar to that of GPA.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Signs and symptoms</span> Oral ulcers are the most common clinical feature, affecting over 95% of patients. Genital ulcers and skin involvement each occur in about 75% of cases. Skin disease can include erythema nodosum (<span class="xref-local">see Fig 9-3</span>), superficial thrombophlebitis, pyoderma, and pathergy (pustular response to skin injury). Approximately half of patients have asymmetric, nondeforming arthritis that commonly affects the knees, wrists, and ankles.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vascular disease can pres&#173;ent as migratory superficial thrombophlebitis, major-&#173;vessel thrombosis, arterial aneurysms, or even peripheral gangrene. CNS disease is found in 20% of patients and includes brainstem syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and confusional states. The major &#173;causes of mortality are from CNS involvement and large-&#173;vessel disease, including arterial aneurysm.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Diagnosis</span> Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease may be associated with a number of nonspecific laboratory abnormalities, including elevated ESR, CRP, and circulating immune complexes. Patients may also have serologic evidence of a hypercoagulable state, and the prevalence of HLA-&#173;B51 is higher than among unaffected individuals. However, no specific laboratory tests are pathognomonic for this disease. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria that include oral ulcers and any 2 of the following: uveitis, genital ulcers, skin involvement, and pathergy. Other criteria may be used, depending on regional differences in disease pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> Management varies according to disease severity and organ systems involved. Patients with mild disease may benefit from colchicine for treatment of arthritis and &#173;ulcers. Oral and genital lesions may respond to topical ste&#173;roid solutions or require systemic therapy if severe. The use of corticosteroids alone may control acute exacerbations but does not seem to alter disease outcome. As a result, 1 or more immunosuppressive agents are usually added as therapy. Interferon-&#173;alfa has also been effective, especially for mucocutaneous manifestations. Treatment of posterior uveitis typically begins with azathioprine and ste&#173;roids. Alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide may be used in refractory cases, although &#173;these drugs may have significant toxicity. Tumor necrosis &#173;factor (TNF)-&#173;<span class="greek">a</span> inhibitors may also be helpful.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Corticosteroids</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Glucocorticoids</span> decrease inflammation by inhibiting the breakdown of phospholipid to arachidonic acid and blocking the production of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Glucocorticoids have a variety of other systemic effects apart from their anti-&#173;inflammatory activity. They promote gluconeogenesis, with a concomitant negative nitrogen balance and reduction in protein production. Fat oxidation, synthesis, storage, and mobilization are also affected. &#173;After glucocorticoid administration, the number of circulating neutrophils increases &#173;because mature neutrophils are released from bone marrow, and their movement from the blood into other tissues is reduced, while the number of other circulating leukocytes decreases. Associated mineralocorticoid activity increases sodium retention and potassium excretion.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;9-4</span> lists the relative potency of commonly used glucocorticoid preparations. The molecular structure of the corticosteroid nucleus can be modified to dissociate gluco&#173;corticoid from mineralocorticoid activity. Unfortunately, isolating the beneficial anti-&#173;inflammatory effects from the less desirable glucocorticoid effects has not been fully achieved. The ophthalmologist must be aware of the ocular and systemic toxicities associated with systemic corticosteroids.</p>
			<p class="h3">Adverse effects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular adverse effects of systemic corticosteroids include posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma, mydriasis, ptosis, papilledema associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, worsening of ocular infection, and delay in wound healing. Systemic complications may include peptic ulceration, osteoporosis, and aseptic necrosis of the femoral head, as well as muscle and skin atrophy. Ste&#173;roids can also cause hyperglycemia, hypertension, edema, weight gain, and changes in body fat distribution, resulting in a cushingoid habitus. Other adverse effects include hyperosmolar nonketotic states, hypokalemia, and growth delay in &#173;children. &#173;Mental changes are a common prob&#173;lem, ranging from mild mood alterations to severe psychological reactions, including psychological dependence.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Osteoporosis is a significant prob&#173;lem that can increase the risk of fractures as early as a few months &#173;after beginning corticosteroid therapy. Bone mineral density testing is used to assess the degree of osteoporosis. In addition to calcium and vitamin D supplementation, hormone replacement therapy and bisphosphonates are sometimes initiated.</p>
			<p class="h3">Cessation of therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rapid withdrawal of systemic corticosteroid therapy can cause complications. The rate of corticosteroid withdrawal is determined by 2 criteria: (1) the degree of hypothalamic-&#173;pituitary-&#173;adrenal (HPA) suppression, which in turn is related to ste&#173;roid potency, dose, and duration of therapy, and (2) the response of the under&#173;lying disease to the corticosteroid withdrawal. HPA suppression is likely pres&#173;ent in patients who have a cushingoid appearance or who have received a glucocorticoid equivalent daily dose greater than or equal to 10&#160;mg of prednisone (alternatively, a continuous eve&#173;ning or bedtime dose of <span class="symbol">≥</span>5&#160;mg) for more than 3 weeks. HPA suppression is reduced below &#173;these par&#173;ameters. When tapering becomes necessary, a practical approach is to reduce ste&#173;roid requirement by 5% to 10% &#173;every 2 to 4 weeks while monitoring response carefully. Other&#173;wise, sudden cessation of corticosteroid therapy could result in adrenal insufficiency, with symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, arthralgias, nausea, orthostatic hypotension, and hypoglycemia. In severe cases, adrenal suppression may be fatal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;After corticosteroid therapy has been discontinued, adrenal function may not return to normal for a year or more, and coverage with supplementary corticosteroids may be required if the patient has a serious illness or undergoes surgery during this recovery period.</p>
			<p class="h3">Other considerations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ophthalmologists who initiate systemic corticosteroid therapy for ophthalmic diseases should consider requesting assistance from the patient’s primary care provider to monitor for adverse effects. For patients who require high-&#173;dose or extended corticosteroid treatment, clinicians should strongly consider early use of other immunosuppressive medi&#173;cations, which can decrease patient de&#173;pen&#173;dency on, and long-&#173;term complications of, corticosteroid use.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Nonsteroidal Anti-&#173;inflammatory Drugs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinicians use a wide variety of NSAIDs to treat RA and other rheumatic diseases. &#173;These agents decrease synthesis of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins by inhibiting the enzyme <span class="italic">cyclooxygenase (COX),</span> and all are analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-&#173;inflammatory. The COX enzyme has 2 isoforms. <span class="italic">COX-1</span> is pres&#173;ent in most cells and appears to be involved in vari&#173;ous aspects of cellular metabolism, such as gastric cytoprotection, platelet aggregation, and renal function. <span class="italic">COX-2</span> is pres&#173;ent in some tissues, including brain and bone, but is also expressed at other sites in response to inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Complications from the use of oral NSAIDs account for approximately 12% of hospital admissions and more than 16,000 deaths each year in the United States. Their most significant adverse effects include gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, hypertension, and heart failure, as well as induction of asthma in aspirin-&#173;sensitive individuals. Oral NSAIDs can also interfere with platelet function and can cause bone marrow suppression, hepatic toxicity, and CNS symptoms including headache, dizziness, and confusion. In rare cases, NSAIDs have been associated with ocular adverse effects such as nonspecific blurred &#173;vision and diplopia. &#173;There have also been reports of pos&#173;si&#173;ble optic neuropathy and macular edema, especially with use of ibuprofen.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">traditional NSAIDs</span> inhibit both isoforms of COX. <span class="italic">Selective COX-2 inhibitors</span> have a lower risk of gastrointestinal damage and have less effect on platelet function. Two of &#173;these drugs (rofecoxib and valdecoxib) have been removed from the market worldwide &#173;because of adverse cardiovascular events. However, parecoxib, a prodrug of valdecoxib, remains available in many Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean countries. Similar concerns have been raised about celecoxib; although it is still available, this drug carries significant warnings. It has been proposed that the selective blocking of COX-2 decreases the production of prostacyclins, which cause vasodilation and inhibit platelet aggregation, leading to increased prothrombotic activity. Etoricoxib, another COX-2–&#173;selective NSAID, is available outside the United States. Ophthalmologists should be aware that conjunctivitis, temporary blindness, and blurred vision have been reported with use of COX-2 inhibitors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic NSAIDs may be useful in helping to control uveitis or scleritis in some patients, but they are not as effective as corticosteroids. Several topical NSAIDs have been approved for ocular use; they are discussed in BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;8</span>, <span class="italic">External Disease and </span><span class="italic">&#173;Cornea,</span> and Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation.</span></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Disease-&#173;Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are 2 major categories of DMARDs: nonbiologic and biologic agents. See <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;9-5</span> for the classification, mechanism, and toxicities of &#173;these drugs.</p>
			<p class="h3">Nonbiologic drugs</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Methotrexate</span> A structural analogue of folic acid, <span class="italic">methotrexate</span> interferes both with folate-&#173;dependent metabolic pathways, such as purine, and with pyrimidine metabolism. Its disease-&#173;modifying effect may be mediated partly through increased extracellular adenosine, which has intrinsic anti-&#173;inflammatory activity. Methotrexate is given weekly, usually beginning at a dose of 7.5–10&#160;mg, gradually increasing to a maximum dose of 25&#160;mg, depending on disease response. All patients are supplemented with folic acid to decrease adverse effects associated with methotrexate use. Major adverse effects include hepatic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, bone marrow toxicity, teratogenicity, sterility, and, in higher dosages, renal toxicity. Baseline and periodic monitoring should include blood counts, liver enzymes, and albumin and creatinine levels.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Leflunomide</span> The immunosuppressive agent <span class="italic">leflunomide</span> targets rapidly dividing cell populations such as activated lymphocytes. It is most commonly used to treat RA, although it has also been effective in managing other conditions including psoriatic arthritis, juvenile polyarthritis, refractory dermatomyositis, and SLE. This drug is similar in efficacy to methotrexate, and the 2 are sometimes combined if methotrexate alone is in&#173;effec&#173;tive. Adverse reactions include GI side effects, hepatotoxicity, and hypertension (especially if taken with NSAIDs). Close monitoring of patients is advised.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Hydroxychloroquine</span> An antimalarial compound, <span class="italic">hydroxychloroquine</span> is also commonly used to treat rheumatologic diseases. In addition to its anti-&#173;inflammatory activity, the drug raises the pH of vari&#173;ous cellular compartments, which decreases both cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation. Response to treatment may take weeks to months, in part &#173;because of the drug’s long half-&#173;life (1–2 months) and the time required to achieve steady-&#173;state levels.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hydroxychloroquine is one of the safest immunosuppressive drugs used in managing rheumatologic disease. Retinopathy (bull’s-&#173;eye maculopathy) due to hydroxychloroquine use is a relatively unusual complication, but it can cause irreversible vision loss if not detected early.</p>

A baseline eye examination is advised within the first year of therapy. Annual follow-up exams can be delayed &#173;until 5&#160;years &#173;after initiation, although this recommendation remains somewhat controversial in the ophthalmic community. More frequent exams are indicated for higher-&#173;risk patients. Duration of treatment is one of the risk &#173;factors, as 20% of patients develop toxicity with 20&#160;years of medi&#173;cation usage. Other risk &#173;factors include preexisting ret&#173;i&#173;nal disease, presence of renal disease, and concurrent tamoxifen use. In addition to comprehensive dilated examinations, spectral domain optical coherence tomography and 10-2 visual field (VF) testing should be performed regularly. Asian patients appear to have a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, with more peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal findings, so a 24-2 or 30-2 VF assessment should be considered instead.

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="h4-head">Sulfasalazine</span> Although its exact mechanism of action is unclear, <span class="italic">sulfasalazine</span> is effective in treating RA. It is often used in combination with other drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Azathioprine</span> An antimetabolite, <span class="italic">azathioprine</span> interferes with purine metabolism. Its use, especially in inflammatory bowel disease, is limited due to its toxicity. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal symptoms, risk of infection, and bone marrow suppression. Patients treated with this drug have up to a 4-&#173;fold increase in the risk of lymphoma.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Alkylating agents</span> <span class="italic">Cyclophosphamide</span> and <span class="italic">chlorambucil</span> are alkylating agents that are very &#173;potent immunosuppressive drugs. Their primary mechanism of action involves cross-&#173;linking DNA molecules, which blocks DNA replication. They also have potentially severe adverse effects, including infertility, bone marrow suppression, increased risk of infection, and late malignancy. Consequently, &#173;these drugs are reserved for very resistant or life-&#173;threatening diseases such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, for which the benefits outweigh the risks. Cyclophosphamide is available as an oral or intravenous agent. The oral form is associated with increased rates of bladder cancer.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Calcineurin inhibitors</span> <span class="italic">Cyclosporine</span> and <span class="italic">tacrolimus</span> block calcineurin, thereby inhibiting the transcription of IL-2 and other cytokines, primarily in helper T cells. &#173;These drugs are used chiefly to prevent rejection in patients who have under&#173;gone transplants, but clinicians are increasingly recognizing their benefit in treating autoimmune diseases. The main adverse effects of both drugs are nephrotoxicity and hypertension. Other &#173;potential prob&#173;lems include infections and nonmelanoma skin cancers. &#173;Because of such risks, &#173;these agents are reserved for recalcitrant cases that do not respond to standard therapies.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Mycophenolate</span> Initially used as an antirejection drug in the United States, <span class="italic">mycophenolate mofetil</span> is increasingly being employed in patients with immunologic diseases. It inhibits the production of guanosine in lymphocytes, thereby decreasing cellular proliferation and antibody production. Primary adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, bone marrow suppression, and increased risk of infection. An enteric-&#173;coated formulation of <span class="italic">mycophenolate sodium</span> typically reduces the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects. Overall, the drug seems to be well tolerated by patients and may serve as an adjunct to other medi&#173;cations.</p>
			<p class="h3">Biologic and other anticytokine agents</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">TNF-&#173;</span><span class="h4-head-greek">a</span> <span class="h4-head">inhibitors</span> Research that facilitated improved understanding of the immune response has led to the development of drugs targeting specific mediators. Cytokines, which are cell-&#173;signaling proteins generated by activated immune cells, can enhance or inhibit the immune response. <span class="italic">Tumor necrosis &#173;factor (TNF)-&#173;</span><span class="greek-italic">a</span> is a major proinflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 5 TNF-&#173;<span class="greek">a</span> antagonists: <span class="italic">adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab,</span> and <span class="italic">infliximab.</span> Certolizumab pegol is unique in this group as being an FDA category B drug and, therefore, is a treatment option for patients who are pregnant or nursing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The drugs are usually well tolerated, but &#173;there is potential for severe adverse effects (see <span class="xref-local">&#173;Table&#160;9-5</span>). Although not established, &#173;there may be a link between TNF-&#173;<span class="greek">a</span> inhibition and demyelinating disease, including optic neuritis, as well as potential risk of vari&#173;ous malignancies. All patients on immunosuppressive therapy require close monitoring for the development of serious adverse effects. The cost of &#173;these drugs can also become a barrier for patients.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Interleukin inhibitors</span> Biologic agents have been developed to block several types of interleukin (IL). Although &#173;these agents are not as potent as the TNF-&#173;<span class="greek">a</span> inhibitors, IL-1 drugs, including <span class="italic">anakinra, canakinumab,</span> and <span class="italic">rilonacept,</span> are used in many autoimmune disorders<span class="italic">.</span> The IL-6 inhibitor <span class="italic">tocilizumab</span> is used primarily for RA and JIA but may also be effective in treating &#173;giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica. The drugs <span class="italic">secukinumab</span> and <span class="italic">ixekizumab</span> block the IL-17 pathway and are mainly used in psoriatic arthritis, as is the IL-12/23 inhibitor, <span class="italic">ustekinumab</span>.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Other biologic agents</span> <span class="italic">Abatacept</span> is used in the treatment of RA and JIA. This drug blocks the CD28 receptor, which is involved in T-&#173;cell activation. It can be very effective in treating refractory disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Rituximab</span> is a B-&#173;cell–&#173;depleting monoclonal antibody used primarily in chemo&#173;therapy but also in cases of RA that are unresponsive to other agents.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Belimumab</span> is a &#173;human monoclonal antibody that inhibits B-&#173;cell activation. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of SLE, but it may also be helpful for other immune disorders.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Alemtuzumab</span> is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CD52, a protein on mature lymphocytes. The drug is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia and has shown promise in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">JAK inhibitors</span> Kinase inhibitors are another group of immunosuppressive agents showing promise in treating rheumatologic disease. Janus kinase is one such enzyme &#173;these drugs target. <span class="italic">Tofacitinib</span> is a small-&#173;molecule oral agent that inhibits JAK-1 and JAK-3. <span class="italic">Baricitinib</span> inhibits JAK-1 and JAK-2. Both are approved by the FDA for rheumatoid arthritis. Their role may be in cases that are refractory to other classes of agents, including nonbiologic agents and TNF-&#173;<span class="greek">a</span> inhibitors.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Biosimilar agents</span> The expiration of patent protection on some biologic agents has led to the development of <span class="italic">biosimilar agents.</span> A biosimilar has amino acid sequencing that is analogous (not identical) to the original compound (<span class="italic">reference product</span>) on which it is based. The FDA requires a biosimilar to be “highly similar to” and to have “no clinically meaningful differences” from the reference product for approval. The use of <span class="italic">infliximab-&#173;dyyb,</span> the biosimilar for infliximab, has grown worldwide and is particularly effective in treating inflammatory bowel disease. This agent, along with the biosimilars for etanercept and adalimumab, was approved in 2016 by the FDA for the treatment of RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Other biosimilar agents continue to be developed.</p>
