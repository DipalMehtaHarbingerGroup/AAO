			<p class="h1">Introduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hypertension (HTN) affects an estimated 103 million persons aged 20&#160;years or older in the United States and approximately 1.39 billion individuals worldwide. Individuals with &#173;hypertension are at greater risk for stroke, myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction (MI), heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, kidney disease, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular complications. The prevalence of hypertension increases with age; it is typically familial and is also related to lifestyle be&#173;hav&#173;iors. HTN is more common in non-&#173;Hispanic black persons than in Hispanic persons, and it is higher in both of &#173;those groups than in white persons. BP control rates are lowest in Mexican American and American Indian individuals. The prevalence and severity of hypertension are increased in black persons, in whom <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers, angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are less effective than diuretics and CCBs in lowering BP. High blood pressure prevalence is also increasing in the Hispanic population. The incidence of devastating complications is higher in lower socioeconomic groups &#173;because of greater prevalence, delayed detection, and poor control rates of multifactorial etiology. Antihypertensive therapy is effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but only 59% of individuals with hypertension are treated, and only 69% of &#173;those individuals achieve a blood pressure of 140/90&#160;mm Hg or lower, according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) in the United States and similar cohorts in Canada and Eu&#173;rope. &#173;Under the new definition of hypertension (systolic pressure greater than or equal to 130&#160;mm Hg and/or a diastolic greater than or equal to 80&#160;mm Hg), only 47% of individuals undergoing hypertensive therapy &#173;will achieve controlled blood pressure. Unfortunately, for many minority patients, socioeconomic and lifestyle &#173;factors continue to be barriers to treatment.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Classification of Blood Pressure and Diagnosis of Hypertension</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In 2003, the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) published a classification of BP for adults aged 18&#160;years or older. The November&#160;2017 ACC/AHA guidelines update this classification. Normal blood pressure is still defined as blood pressure that is less than 120/80&#160;mm Hg. The prehypertension category has been eliminated entirely. Elevated blood pressure is now classified as systolic blood pressure between 120–129&#160;mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 80&#160;mm Hg. Stage 1 hypertension is defined as systolic BP between 130–139&#160;mm Hg or diastolic BP between 80–89&#160;mm Hg. Stage 2 HTN refers to systolic BP of at least 140&#160;mm Hg or diastolic BP of at least 90&#160;mm Hg (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;3-1</span>). &#173;These classifications are based on the average of 2 or more properly mea&#173;sured seated BP readings during each of 2 or more office visits or other outpatient assessments such as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure monitoring with an approved device.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In 10%–15% of patients, BP increases only while in a physician’s office; &#173;these patients are said to have “white coat” hypertension. Home BP monitoring or 24-&#173;hour ambulatory BP mea&#173;sure&#173;ment (ABPM) is warranted in &#173;these individuals and in patients with labile &#173;hypertension, resistant hypertension, hypotensive episodes, or postural hypotension, as well as in patients with masked hypertension (normal blood pressure in the office setting but abnormal readings at home). ABPM, which is more widely used in Eu&#173;rope, provides data on circadian variations of BP. ABPM readings are usually lower than mea&#173;sure&#173;ments taken in a physician’s office, and they correlate better with target-&#173;organ injury than do office mea&#173;sure&#173;ments. BP in most individuals decreases by 10%–20% during sleep (dipping pattern); &#173;those without such a decrease (nondipping pattern) are at greater risk for cardiovascular and neurovascular events. Masked hypertension may occur in 10%–30% of patients and carries a worse prognosis than white coat hypertension with regard to the development of atherosclerosis. Thus, it is impor&#173;tant to recognize that a normal office BP does not exclude hypertension. Individuals with a mean self-&#173;measured daytime BP above 135/85&#160;mm Hg or a nighttime BP of 120/70&#160;mm Hg at home are generally considered to be hypertensive.</p>

			<p class="h1">Etiology and Pathogenesis of Hypertension</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 90% of cases of hypertension are <span class="italic">primary (essential),</span> in which the etiology is unknown, and 10% are secondary to identifiable &#173;causes. Primary hypertension most likely results from a dysregulation of vari&#173;ous renal, hormonal, and cellular pro&#173;cesses in conjunction with environmental &#173;factors such as diet and exercise. &#173;These pro&#173;cesses include abnormal sodium transport, increased sympathetic ner&#173;vous system activity, abnormal vasodilation, excess transforming growth &#173;factors <span class="greek">b</span> (TGF-&#173;<span class="greek">b</span>s), and abnormalities in the renin-&#173;angiotensin-&#173;aldosterone system (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Causes of <span class="italic">secondary hypertension</span> vary. Following are some of &#173;these &#173;causes, along with signs associated with secondary hypertension:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">polycystic kidney disease:</span> flank mass</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">renovascular disease:</span> unilateral abdominal bruit in a young patient with marked hypertension; new-&#173;onset hypertension with severe end-&#173;organ disease</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">pheochromocytoma:</span> markedly labile BP with tachycardia and headache</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">hyperaldosteronism:</span> per&#173;sis&#173;tent hypokalemia in the absence of diuretic therapy or marked drop with low-&#173;dose diuretics</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">coarctation of the aorta:</span> delayed or absent femoral pulses in a young patient</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">Cushing syndrome:</span> truncal obesity and abdominal striae</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Secondary &#173;causes of hypertension should be suspected in persons who have accelerating hypertension or hypertension unresponsive to medi&#173;cation or in &#173;those who have a sudden change in previously well-&#173;controlled BP. Patients with secondary hypertension are more likely to have <span class="italic">resistant hypertension</span>, which is defined as a failure to achieve goal BP even when the patient adheres to the optimal doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs, including a diuretic. The prevalence of resistant hypertension is currently not known, but indirect population study evidence suggests it is more common than previously suspected. This prevalence may be secondary to an aging population, and the increased prevalence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and chronic kidney disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most cases of diagnosed resistant hypertension are due to inadequate dosing of medi&#173;cation and patient nonadherence to treatment. The most common &#173;factors contributing to resistant hypertension are excess sodium intake, volume overload, and failure to treat the condition, &#173;whether with dietary modification or the proper diuretic and dosage. Other &#173;causes of secondary hypertension and resistant hypertension are listed in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;3-2</span>.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Evaluation of Patients With Hypertension</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines expanded the recommended procedures for evaluation of patients with hypertension; the recommended evaluation includes an assessment of lifestyle and the identification of other cardiovascular risk &#173;factors (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;3-3</span>), a search for &#173;causes of secondary hypertension, and determination of the presence or absence of target-&#173;organ damage and cardiovascular disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The physical examination of the patient should include mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of BP in both arms (from at least 2 readings taken on 2 or 3 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent occasions); mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of orthostatic BP; ophthalmoscopic examination; calculation of body mass index; mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of waist circumference, which is considered the most impor&#173;tant anthropometric &#173;factor associated with hypertensive risk; auscultation for carotid, abdominal, and femoral bruits; examination of the thyroid gland; examination of the heart and lungs; examination of the abdomen for masses and aortic pulsation; examination of the lower extremities for edema and pulses; and neurologic assessment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Laboratory tests to screen for secondary &#173;causes and exclude comorbidity (recommended before starting treatment) include an electrocardiogram, urinalysis, complete blood count, and serum chemistry studies, including uric acid tests and a fasting lipid profile. Patients with suspected cardiac morbidities should have a 2-&#173;dimensional echocardiogram. More extensive testing for identifiable &#173;causes of hypertension is usually not indicated &#173;unless BP control is not achieved or if other clinical findings warrant further evaluation.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Treatment of Hypertension</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The primary objective of antihypertensive therapy is to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. Controlling systolic BP is the major concern &#173;because, in patients older than 50&#160;years, systolic BP greater than 140&#160;mm Hg is a more impor&#173;tant cardiovascular risk &#173;factor than diastolic BP. In addition, diastolic BP is usually controlled when the systolic goal is reached. Maintaining BP at less than 130/80&#160;mm Hg decreases cardiovascular complications. In hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus or renal disease, the BP goal is less than 120/80&#160;mm Hg. &#173;These patients have a higher incidence of proteinuria, which is associated with hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular events, and overall higher morbidity. Effective BP control can be attained in most patients with hypertension, but the majority of &#173;these patients require 2 or more medi&#173;cations to achieve this control. It is impor&#173;tant for patients to understand that lifelong treatment is usually necessary and that symptoms are not a reliable indicator of the severity of hypertension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When selecting the appropriate therapy for a patient, the physician should consider multiple &#173;factors: stage of hypertension, target-&#173;organ disease, cardiovascular risk &#173;factors, cost, adherence, adverse effects, and comorbid conditions. In general, the higher the BP, the greater the damage to target organs; and the greater the risk &#173;factors for cardiovascular disease, the sooner treatment should be initiated. For example, patients with severe hypertension and encephalopathy require urgent treatment, whereas &#173;those with mild hypertension may wish to attempt lifestyle modifications before drug therapy is initiated along with consideration of comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus and obesity.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lifestyle Modifications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Obesity, sedentary lifestyle, excessive sodium intake, moderate daily alcohol consumption, and inadequate intake of vitamins and minerals, including potassium, calcium, magnesium, and folate, can contribute to the development of hypertension. Smoking is also a major contributor to cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. Lifestyle modifications, including reducing weight, adopting the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan, reducing dietary sodium intake, increasing physical activity, and moderating alcohol and caffeine consumption can decrease BP, enhance the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs, and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease; <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;3-4</span> pres&#173;ents further details. The PREMIER trial investigated the benefit of adding behavioral modifications such as increased physical activity to the DASH diet. At 18 months, the prevalence of hypertension remained lowest in this group compared with &#173;those on the DASH program alone and with &#173;those who had only received advice once on dietary and behavioral intervention. Such healthful lifestyle habits are essential for the prevention and control of hypertension.</p>
			<p class="h2">Pharmacologic Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several classes of drugs effectively lower BP and reduce the complications resulting from hypertension. The most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs include diuretics, <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;3-5</span> lists &#173;these and other types of oral antihypertensive drugs. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;3-2</span> provides an algorithm for the treatment of hypertension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines focus on the pharmacologic treatment of hypertension. The JNC 7 guidelines recommended thiazide-&#173;type diuretics as the initial drug therapy &#173;unless compelling reasons dictated other&#173;wise. In the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, thiazides are not necessarily the first-&#173;line therapy; CCBs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers are alternatives. The initial drug choice for nonblack patients may be selected from 4 drug classes, based on clinical setting and comorbidities: thiazide-&#173;type diuretics, CCBs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs. For black patients, the initial drug choice may be selected from 2 drug classes: thiazide-&#173;type diuretics and CCBs.</p>
			<p class="h3">Antihypertensive Drugs</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Diuretics</span> Diuretics are categorized by their site of action in the kidney and are divided into thiazide, loop, and potassium-&#173;sparing types.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Thiazide-&#173;type diuretics</span> send more of a sodium load to the kidney’s distal tubules, &#173;initially decreasing plasma volume and cardiac output through natriuresis. As the renin-&#173;angiotensin-&#173;aldosterone system compensates for the diminished plasma volume, cardiac output returns to normal and peripheral vascular re&#173;sis&#173;tance is lowered. Chlorthalidone, 12.5–25&#160;mg, can be used in patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30&#160;mL/min and has a strong safety and cardio-&#173;protective profile.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Loop diuretics</span> act on the ascending loop of Henle and block sodium resorption, increasing &#173;free &#173;water loss, resulting in an initial decrease in plasma volume. As with thiazide-&#173;type diuretics, BP is eventually lowered &#173;because of decreased peripheral vascular re&#173;sis&#173;tance. Loop diuretics are used primarily in treating patients with moderate renal insufficiency.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Potassium-&#173;sparing diuretics</span> may block the actions of aldosterone to prevent potassium loss from the distal tubule, or they may act directly on the distal tubule to inhibit aldosterone-&#173;induced sodium resorption in exchange for potassium. They are often used as adjuncts to the thiazide-&#173;type or loop diuretics to counteract potassium depletion, but in patients with suspected hyperaldosterone states they may be used alone.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Side effects of diuretics vary according to class. Thiazide-&#173;type diuretics can cause weakness, muscle cramps, impotence, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, hypercalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, azotemia, and pancreatitis. Thiazide-&#173;type diuretics may also unmask type 2 diabetes and aggravate lipid disorders. On a positive note, they may also slow the demineralization that occurs with osteoporosis. Loop diuretics can cause ototoxicity, as well as electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. Potassium-&#173;sparing diuretics can cause hyperkalemia, renal calculi, renal tubular damage, and gynecomastia. Diuretics are particularly effective in individuals with salt-&#173;sensitive hypertension such as older persons and in black persons.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme inhibitors</span> Angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme (ACE) catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, is the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-&#173;angiotensin-&#173;aldosterone system, and it plays a major role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, resulting in vasodilation with decreased peripheral vascular re&#173;sis&#173;tance and natriuresis. They also decrease aldosterone production and increase levels of vasodilating bradykinins. Some ACE inhibitors stimulate production of vasodilatory prostaglandins. The efficacy of ACE inhibitors is enhanced when they are used in combination with diuretics, reducing hypokalemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hyper&#173;uricemia caused by diuretic therapy. ACE inhibitors are beneficial in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and with proteinuria, especially in patients with diabetes. ACE inhibitors may also help improve insulin sensitivity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adverse effects of ACE inhibitors include a dry cough (5%–20% of patients), angioneurotic edema, hypotension, hyperkalemia, abnormal taste, leukopenia, and proteinuria; in addition, patients may have a reduced GFR (30% of patients). Preexisting renal artery stenosis should be considered in this clinical situation. In patients with volume-&#173;reduced states, ACE inhibitors should be suspended and reassessed &#173;later. ACE inhibitors should be avoided in patients with a history of angioedema or known renal artery stenosis (RAS). They are contraindicated during pregnancy and in patients trying to become pregnant &#173;because of the adverse effects on fetal renal function and risk of fetal death.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Angiotensin II receptor blockers</span> Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-&#173;secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the angiotensin II receptors that are found in such tissues as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland, resulting in decreased peripheral vascular re&#173;sis&#173;tance. ARBs are effective in managing hypertension in a variety of situations, including in patients with heart failure who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs also have been associated with a reduced incidence of new-&#173;onset diabetes mellitus and, like ACE inhibitors, improve insulin sensitivity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The adverse effects of ARBs are similar to &#173;those occurring with ACE inhibitors, though they occur less commonly with ARBs. The dry cough caused by ACE inhibitors generally does not occur with use of ARBs, and angioedema is rare. Like ACE inhibitors, ARBs are contraindicated in pregnancy &#173;unless &#173;there is profound proteinuria, and then use is very closely monitored. ACE inhibitors should not be combined with ARBs.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Calcium channel blockers</span> Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) block the entry of calcium into vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in reduced myo&#173;car&#173;dial contractility and decreased systemic vascular re&#173;sis&#173;tance. CCBs are divided into 2 types: dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine. Dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs tend to be more potent vasodilators, whereas the nondihydropyridine CCBs have more marked negative inotropic effects.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adverse effects of CCBs vary according to the agent but include constipation, headache, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, palpitations, flushing, edema, gingival hyperplasia, arrhythmias, and cardiac ischemia. &#173;Because of their negative inotropic effects, nondihydropyridine CCBs should generally be avoided in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation or heart failure associated with left ventricular dysfunction and in patients with acute MI. Dihydropyridine CCBs may be helpful in patients with Raynaud syndrome and in some arrhythmias.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head_greek">b</span><span class="h4-head">-&#173;Blockers</span> &#173;There are 2 types of <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;adrenergic receptor sites: <span class="greek">b</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">1</span> is pres&#173;ent in vascular and cardiac tissue, and <span class="greek">b</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span> is found in the bronchial system. Circulating or locally released catecholamines stimulate <span class="greek">b</span> sites, resulting in vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, tachycardia, and increased myo&#173;car&#173;dial contractility. <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;Blockers inhibit &#173;these effects. They also decrease plasma renin, reset baroreceptors to facilitate lower BP, induce the release of vasodilatory prostaglandins, and decrease plasma volume, and they may have a central ner&#173;vous system–&#173;mediated antihypertensive effect.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;Blockers are divided into &#173;those that are nonselective (<span class="greek">b</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> and <span class="greek">b</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>), &#173;those that are cardioselective (primarily <span class="greek">b</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>), and &#173;those that have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). The cardioselective agents may be prescribed with caution in patients with pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, or peripheral arterial disease, but at higher doses they lose their <span class="greek">b</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> selectivity and can cause adverse effects in &#173;these patients. &#173;Those agents with ISA minimize the bradycardia caused by other <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers. <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;Blockers with <span class="greek">a</span>-&#173;blocking properties, such as carvedilol or labetalol, have additional vasodilatory effects caused by selective <span class="greek">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-&#173;receptor blockade. In patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, the use of certain <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers—&#173;particularly carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol—&#173;reduces hospitalizations for heart failure and improves survival rates. Nebivolol has nitric oxide–&#173;potentiating vasodilatory effects. <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;Blockers are beneficial in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and tachyarrhythmias, migraine, thyrotoxicosis, and essential tremor.</p>

Adverse effects are similar to &#173;those of other <span class="greek">a</span>-&#173;adrenergic and <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;adrenergic antagonists.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Centrally acting adrenergic drugs</span> Centrally acting adrenergic drugs are potent antihypertensive agents that stimulate presynaptic <span class="greek">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;adrenergic receptors in the central ner&#173;vous system (CNS), causing reductions in the tone and contractility of smooth muscle, cardiac output, and peripheral vascular re&#173;sis&#173;tance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adverse effects include fluid retention, dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, rash, impotence, and hepatitis; positive results on the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test and the antinuclear antibody (ANA) test; and heart failure in patients with decreased left ventricular dysfunction. &#173;There may also be severe rebound hypertension if the drug is abruptly discontinued.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Methyldopa continues to be widely used in pregnancy &#173;because of its proven safety. Older centrally acting sympatholytic agents (eg, reserpine) have significant adverse effects and are seldom used.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Direct vasodilators</span> Direct-&#173;acting vasodilators such as minoxidil and hydralazine decrease peripheral vascular re&#173;sis&#173;tance by direct arterial vasodilation. They are generally reserved for special situations, such as pregnancy or intractable hypertension. They should be avoided or used with caution in patients with ischemic heart disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adverse effects include headache, tachycardia, edema, nausea, vomiting, a lupuslike syndrome, and hypertrichosis. &#173;Because of the sympathetic hyperactivity and the sodium and fluid retention caused by direct vasodilators, they are often used in conjunction with diuretics or <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Combination therapy</span> Combination therapy usually includes small doses of a diuretic, which potentiates the effects of other drugs such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers. This therapy may improve patient adherence and reduce BP to target levels more quickly than other classes of drugs. Another advantage of combination therapy is that low-&#173;dose therapy with 2 antihypertensive drugs is associated with fewer adverse effects than is higher-&#173;dose therapy with a single agent.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Direct renin inhibitors</span> Aliskiren is the first orally active renin inhibitor launched to treat hypertension. It has a high specificity for renin and has a long half-&#173;life (approximately 24&#160;hours), which makes it ideal for once-&#173;daily treatment of hypertension. Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) are more likely to be effective in younger white patients, who, in general, have a more active renin system, and in any patients receiving diuretics or CCBs, in whom the renin system has been activated. The main adverse effect of DRIs is pos&#173;si&#173;ble diarrhea at higher doses.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Parenteral antihypertensive drugs</span> Parenteral antihypertensive therapy is indicated for immediate reduction of BP in hypertensive emergencies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sodium nitroprusside, a direct arterial and venous vasodilator, is the drug of choice for most hypertensive emergencies. Nitroglycerin may be preferable in patients with severe coronary insufficiency or advanced kidney or liver disease. Labetalol is also effective and is the drug of choice in hypertensive emergencies that occur in pregnancy. Esmolol is a cardioselective <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;adrenergic antagonist that can be used in hypertensive emergencies when <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blocker intolerance is a concern; it is also useful in treating aortic dissection. Phentolamine is effective in managing hypertension with acute drug intoxication or withdrawal. Nicardipine is a CCB that can be administered intravenously for postoperative hypertension. Intravenous enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that can be effective in the treatment of postoperative hypertension, although unpredictable results have been reported with its use. Diazoxide and hydralazine are used infrequently now, but hydralazine does have a long-&#173;established safety profile and may be useful in pregnancy-&#173;related hypertensive emergencies.</p>
			<p class="h2">&#173;Future Treatments and Targets for Hypertension</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Data from the Conduit Artery Function Endpoint (CAFE) study showed that dif&#173;fer&#173;ent classes of antihypertensive drugs have dif&#173;fer&#173;ent effects on brachial versus central aortic systolic and pulse pressures and that central pressures may be a better predictor of cardiovascular outcomes in response to treatment. The Strong Heart Study also showed that central aortic pressures may be a better predictor of target end-&#173;organ damage and outcomes than are conventional brachial pressures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thus, it is worth mentioning several other drugs, such as soluble guanylate cyclase activators, that would lower central aortic pressures. &#173;These increase cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels in target tissues, resulting in vasodilation and an antiproliferative effect. One study found that such an activator lowered BP and inhibited cardiac hypertrophy in rats with angiotensin II–&#173;induced hypertension. This drug may also potentially reduce large-&#173;artery stiffness, lowering central aortic systolic pressures beyond the benefits observed on brachial BP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other experimental agents, known as <span class="italic">advanced glycation cross-&#173;link breakers,</span> target vascular wall thickness and its effects on BP. We know that increased large-&#173;artery stiffness &#173;occurs with aging and disease and is associated with increased brachial systolic pressure. This increased pressure is due to the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) within the vascular wall. AGEs also impair endothelial function, leading to arterial stiffness. Therefore, targeting &#173;these molecules to reduce their levels or indeed their presence in vascular walls may have an effect on decreasing vessel stiffness and lowering BP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other intriguing studies have involved attempts to develop a vaccine for hypertension and the use of acu&#173;punc&#173;ture in treatment of hypertension. Nonpharmacologic device-&#173;based therapies are being investigated to treat resistant hypertension, including renal denervation, baroreflex activation therapy, carotid body ablation, central iliac arteriovenous anastomosis, deep brain stimulation, median nerve stimulation, and vagal nerve stimulation. Catheter-&#173;based radiofrequency ablation of the renal sympathetic nerves can lower BP in patients with resistant hypertension. The initial results look promising, but it is not yet known &#173;whether the antihypertensive effect of radiofrequency ablation is due in part to improved patient adherence to the medi&#173;cation regimen. &#173;These techniques have been found to be of limited efficacy. Long-&#173;term data regarding &#173;these modalities are still lacking.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Special Considerations</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top7">
			<p class="h2-h1">Ischemic Heart Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For patients with hypertension and stable angina pectoris, a <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blocker is generally the initial drug of choice; alternatively, CCBs can be used. ACE inhibitors and <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers are recommended as first-&#173;line drugs in hypertensive patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or MI). In post-&#173;MI patients, <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers, ACE inhibitors, and potassium-&#173;sparing diuretics (aldosterone antagonists) are beneficial.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Heart Failure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In asymptomatic patients with hypertension and ventricular dysfunction, ACE inhibitors and <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers are recommended. In patients with symptomatic ventricular dysfunction or end-&#173;stage heart failure, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, aldosterone antagonists, loop diuretics, and <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers—&#173;especially carvedilol, bisoprolol, or nebivolol—&#173;are useful.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As mentioned earlier, hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus usually require 2 or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve a BP goal of less than 130/80&#160;mm Hg. Chlorthalidone (the preferred thiazide diuretic), <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs reduce cardiovascular complications in &#173;these patients. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are beneficial for &#173;those with diabetic nephropathy.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Chronic Renal Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Aggressive treatment, often with 3 or more drugs, may be necessary to achieve a BP goal of less than 130/80&#160;mm Hg and to prevent deterioration of renal function and cardiovascular complications in hypertensive patients with chronic renal disease. ACE inhibitors and ARBs favorably alter the progression of diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy. However, as the GFR nears 20&#160;mL/min, less aggressive treatment may be appropriate, particularly in patients with renin-&#173;angiotensin-&#173;aldosterone system suppression.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cerebrovascular Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The combination of an ACE inhibitor and the appropriate diuretic lowers the risk of recurrent stroke. The optimal BP level during an acute stroke remains undetermined, but consensus &#173;favors intermediate control in the range of 160/100&#160;mm Hg &#173;until patient stabilization is achieved.</p>
			<p class="h2">Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Obesity (body mass index <span class="symbol">≥</span>30) is a risk &#173;factor for the development of hypertension and has become a major concern in the United States, where an estimated 160 million adults are overweight or obese. Closely related to obesity is <span class="italic">metabolic syndrome.</span> This syndrome is characterized by the presence of 3 or more of &#173;these conditions: central (abdominal) obesity, elevated triglyceride level, reduced high-&#173;density lipoprotein cholesterol level, hypertension, and elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Patients with &#173;these conditions should adopt healthful lifestyle habits and, if necessary, use drug therapy, excepting thiazide-&#173;type diuretics, which may aggravate this syndrome. <span class="xref-local">See Chapter&#160;2</span> for additional discussion of metabolic syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h2">Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) often coexist. OSAS is a sleep-&#173;related breathing disorder with cardinal signs, including obstructive apneas; hypopneas; and sleep disturbances with snoring, restlessness, or resuscitative snorts. This disrupted sleep leads to daytime fatigue, poor concentration, and sleeplessness and has been associated with the development of heart disease and metabolic syndrome. &#173;There is an increased prevalence and incidence of hypertension in &#173;these patients and an observed dose-&#173;response effect between the severity of OSAS and the likelihood of hypertension. Treatment of OSAS can lower BP by clinically significant levels.</p>
			<p class="h2">Left Ventricular Hypertrophy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Left ventricular hypertrophy is a risk &#173;factor for cardiovascular disease, but regression is pos&#173;si&#173;ble with treatment of hypertension. All antihypertensive drug classes, except the direct vasodilators, are effective in treating left ventricular hypertrophy.</p>
			<p class="h2">Peripheral Arterial Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The risk &#173;factors for peripheral arterial disease parallel &#173;those for ischemic heart disease in patients with hypertension. All classes of antihypertensive agents are useful in treating hypertensive patients with peripheral arterial disease.</p>

This decrease in BP may be exacerbated when antihypertensive medi&#173;cations are taken at night. Systemic nocturnal hypotension may be a risk factor for low-&#173;tension glaucoma. &#173;There is also some evidence that nocturnal arterial&#160;hypotension may play a role in the development of nonarteritic anterior&#160;ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), which has been associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). OSAS may increase the risk of NAION and low-&#173;tension glaucoma via several potential mechanisms, including impaired autoregulation of optic nerve head blood flow, optic nerve vascular dysregulation, and direct optic nerve damage due to prolonged hypoxia. OSAS also plays a role in the development of vari&#173;ous ret&#173;i&#173;nal findings, including microaneurysms, hypertensive retinopathy, and intraocular production of postischemic molecules that are associated with neovascularization, apoptosis, and macular edema.</p>
			<p class="h2">Orthostatic Hypotension</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a postural drop in systolic blood pressure of more than 10&#160;mm Hg associated with dizziness or fainting. It occurs more frequently in older patients with systolic hypertension; in patients with diabetes mellitus; and in &#173;those taking diuretics, vasodilators, or certain psychotropic drugs. In &#173;these individuals, BP should be monitored while they are in the upright position, and hypovolemia should be avoided. Also, medi&#173;cation dosages should be carefully titrated and vari&#173;ous shorter-&#173;acting drugs considered for &#173;these patients.</p>
			<p class="h2">Hypertension in Older Patients</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hypertension is pres&#173;ent in most individuals older than 65&#160;years. Treatment recommendations for patients in this age group are generally the same as for &#173;others with hypertension. In older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the preferred treatment is a diuretic with or without a <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blocker, or a dihydropyridine CCB alone. Diastolic BP less than 75&#160;mm Hg increases &#173;these patients’ risk of stroke and should be avoided.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Antihypertensive drug therapy in older patients can cause adverse effects that increase the risk of falls, such as dizziness and hypotension. Appropriate precautions should be taken to reduce this risk and enhance patient safety.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Dementia occurs more commonly in individuals with hypertension. In some patients, antihypertensive therapy may slow the progression of cognitive impairment.</p>
			<p class="h2">&#173;Women and Pregnancy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because the use of oral contraceptives increases the risk of hypertension, &#173;women taking oral contraceptives should have regular BP checks. Hypertension in &#173;women who are pregnant may be classified as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">preeclampsia or eclampsia:</span> preeclampsia—&#173;hypertension, proteinuria, generalized edema, and possibly coagulation and liver function abnormalities &#173;after 20 weeks’ gestation; eclampsia—&#173;those same abnormalities plus generalized seizures</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">chronic hypertension:</span> BP greater than 140/90&#160;mm Hg before 20 weeks’ gestation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia or eclampsia</span></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-9"><span class="italic">transient hypertension:</span> hypertension without proteinuria or CNS manifestations during pregnancy; the return of normal BP within 10 days of delivery</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Hypertension in &#173;women who are pregnant can potentially increase maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The pos&#173;si&#173;ble adverse effects of antihypertensive drug therapy on fetal development must be considered, however, when pharmacologic treatment is planned. Methyldopa, <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers, and vasodilators are the recommended drugs for treatment of hypertension in pregnancy. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated in pregnancy &#173;because of teratogenic effects; they should also be avoided in &#173;women who are likely to become pregnant.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">&#173;Children and Adolescents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Considerable advances have been made in the detection, evaluation, and management of hypertension in &#173;children and adolescents. Current evidence indicates that primary hypertension in young individuals occurs more commonly than previously recognized and has substantial long-&#173;term health implications. &#173;There is &#173;little doubt that obesity in young &#173;people is a predictor for developing hypertension as well as associated metabolic risk &#173;factors. Hypertension in individuals aged 3–18&#160;years is defined as average systolic BP and/or diastolic BP that is in the 95th&#160;percentile or higher for sex, age, and height, taken on 3 or more occasions. BP between the 90th&#160;percentile and the 95th&#160;percentile in childhood is designated as <span class="italic">elevated</span> and is an indication for lifestyle modifications. It is recommended that &#173;children older than 3&#160;years have their BP mea&#173;sured when they are examined in a medical setting.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Children and adolescents who are hypertensive are frequently overweight, and some may have sleep disorders. Secondary hypertension occurs more commonly in &#173;children than in adults.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Indications for initiating antihypertensive drug therapy in &#173;children include uncontrolled hypertension despite nonpharmacologic mea&#173;sures, symptomatic hypertension, secondary hypertension, hypertensive target-&#173;organ damage, and hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus. Acceptable drug choices for treating hypertension in &#173;children include &#173;diuretics, <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Withdrawal Syndromes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hypertension can be associated with withdrawal from alcohol or drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, and opioid analgesics. Withdrawal syndromes can occur with acute drug intoxication or as the result of abrupt discontinuation of a drug &#173;after long-&#173;term use. Phentolamine, sodium nitroprusside, and nitroglycerin are all effective in the immediate management of hypertension in &#173;these situations. <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;Blockers should not be used, &#173;because unopposed <span class="greek">a</span>-&#173;adrenergic stimulation may exacerbate the hypertension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Monoamine oxidase inhibitors taken with certain drugs or with tyramine-&#173;containing foods can increase catecholamine levels, thereby causing accelerated hypertension. Phentolamine, sodium nitroprusside, and labetalol are effective for treating this type of hypertension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Abrupt discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy can cause severe rebound hypertension. This occurs most commonly in patients taking centrally acting adrenergic agents (particularly clonidine) or <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers, but it can occur with other drug classes as well, including diuretics. When an acute withdrawal syndrome occurs, and parenteral antihypertensive treatment is necessary, sodium nitroprusside is the drug of choice.</p>
			<p class="h2">Hypertensive Crisis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with severe BP elevation and acute target-&#173;organ damage (eg, encephalopathy, MI, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, stroke, head trauma, eclampsia, or aortic dissection) should be admitted to the hospital for emergency parenteral antihypertensive therapy. &#173;Patients with marked BP elevation but without target-&#173;organ damage may not require &#173;hospital admission, but they should be treated urgently with combination oral antihypertensive drugs. Identifiable &#173;causes of hypertension should be sought, and &#173;these patients should be carefully monitored for target-&#173;organ damage.</p>

Moreover, ophthalmic surgery patients with poorly controlled hypertension may be more susceptible to intraoperative and postoperative complications.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">&#173;There is strong evidence that certain signs of hypertensive retinopathy, in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent of other risk &#173;factors, are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Based on &#173;these reported associations, a simplified classification of hypertensive retinopathy was proposed in 2004 (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;3-6</span>).</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">In addition to the kidney, the renin angiotensin system (RAS) exists in ocular tissues and are overexpressed in the ret&#173;ina of individuals with diabetes. In the ret&#173;ina, angiotensin II activates receptors that stimulate pathways involved in diabetic retinopathy, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation, pericyte migration, remodeling of extracellular matrix, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. RAS blockade is thought to attenuate or inhibit &#173;these pathogenic effects.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines emphasize the importance of patient assessment and education, echoing earlier reviews from the JNC 7 and several other socie&#173;ties (Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean Society of Hypertension, Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean Society of Cardiology, American Society of Hypertension, International Society of Hypertension). &#173;These organ&#173;izations generally agree that control of hypertension is pos&#173;si&#173;ble only if patients are motivated to take their prescribed medi&#173;cations and to maintain healthful lifestyle habits. Motivation improves when individuals develop empathy with and trust in their physicians. As members of the health care team, ophthalmologists have an impor&#173;tant role in the identification, monitoring, and shared management of patients with hypertension.</p>
