			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. In 2012, DM was pres&#173;ent in 12.3% of persons over the age of 20&#160;years in the United States and in 49% of &#173;those over the age of 65&#160;years. A substantial percentage of affected individuals have not been diagnosed. Type 2 DM represents 90%–95% of all cases of DM, with type 1 DM and other &#173;causes representing the remaining 10%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Persons with DM are at risk for microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, and are at increased risk for macrovascular disease. Among adult patients, type 2 DM is accompanied by hypertension (in approximately 75%) and hyperlipidemia (in more than 50%). It is considered a cardiac risk equivalent &#173;because of the high excess risk it poses for macrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease events, and mortality.</p>

Accessed February 21, 2019.</p>
			<p class="h2">Classification of Diabetes Mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">DM is classified into 4 clinical types.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Type 1 DM</span> (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>10% of all cases) results from a cell-&#173;mediated autoimmune destruction of <span class="greek">b</span> cells in the pancreas. It can pres&#173;ent at any age; and, &#173;because of its variable clinical phenotypes, the diagnosis can be challenging in adults. The rate of destruction of <span class="greek">b</span> cells is rapid in infants and &#173;children and slower in adults. Therefore, ketoacidosis as an initial pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion is more common in young patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)</span>, a subtype of type 1 DM, is characterized by mild to moderate hyperglycemia and, initially, often does not require insulin therapy. Adults with LADA have one or more <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;cell–&#173;specific autoantibodies and &#173;will tend to require insulin therapy sooner than patients with classic type 2 DM. Type 1 DM should be suspected when &#173;there is a positive &#173;family history, thyroid disease, or other autoimmune disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Type 2 DM</span> (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>90% of cases) is characterized by insulin re&#173;sis&#173;tance followed by defective insulin secretion and loss of <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;cell mass. The reason for this <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;cell loss is unknown, but programmed cell death in response to ge&#173;ne&#173;tic and environmental &#173;factors has been demonstrated in animal models. Type 2 disease is usually diagnosed in adults, with both incidence and prevalence increasing with age. However, it is becoming more common in &#173;children and now accounts for up to one-&#173;third of new cases of diabetes mellitus diagnosed in patients between the ages of 5 and 15&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This type of DM is associated with obesity, a positive &#173;family history, history of gestational diabetes or prediabetes, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity. African American, Hispanic, and American Indian individuals have a greater risk of developing type 2 DM than white individuals. Type 2 DM may be asymptomatic and remain undiagnosed for months to years.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Gestational DM</span> is glucose intolerance that has its onset or diagnosis during pregnancy (occurs in 5%–20% of pregnancies).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Other types of DM</span> include &#173;those caused by ge&#173;ne&#173;tic defects in insulin secretion or action, pancreatic surgery, disease of the exocrine pancreas (eg, cystic fibrosis), endocrinopathies (eg, Cushing syndrome), or drugs (eg, glucocorticoids, thiazide-&#173;type diuretics, and aty&#173;pi&#173;cal antipsychotic medi&#173;cations).</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">DM is diagnosed by means of tests that evaluate glucose tolerance. A definitive diagnosis is made when at least 1 of the 4 following criteria is met and confirmed with repeat testing:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">HbA<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1c</span> <span class="symbol">≥</span>6.5% (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>5.7% <span class="symbol">=</span> normal), reflecting average levels of blood glucose over 3&#160;months</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="h3">Prediabetes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Persons with prediabetes have an increased risk for developing diabetes mellitus. The following abnormal test results suggest prediabetes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">HbA<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1c</span> 5.7%–6.4%</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">FPG level 100–125&#160;mg/dL (5.6–5.9&#160;mmol/L)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">OGTT plasma glucose level 140–199&#160;mg/dL (7.8–11.0&#160;mmol/L) 2 hours &#173;after intake of a 75-&#173;g glucose load</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Progression from impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 DM occurs at a rate of about 12% per year.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Metabolic syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Metabolic syndrome is a serious health condition that affects about 23% of adults in the United States, putting them at higher risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and diseases related to the buildup of fatty plaques in artery walls. The under&#173;lying &#173;causes of metabolic syndrome include overweight and obesity, physical inactivity, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;factors, and aging.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Metabolic syndrome is characterized by the presence of 3 or more of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">FPG <span class="symbol">≥</span>100&#160;mg/dL</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">abdominal obesity (waist circumference <span class="symbol">&gt;</span>102&#160;cm in men and <span class="symbol">&gt;</span>89&#160;cm in &#173;women)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">triglyceride level <span class="symbol">≥</span>150&#160;mg/dL or greater</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">HDL cholesterol <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>40&#160;mg/dL in men or <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>50&#160;mg/dL in &#173;women</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">systolic blood pressure <span class="symbol">≥</span>130&#160;mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure <span class="symbol">≥</span>85&#160;mm Hg</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Individuals can decrease their risk of metabolic syndrome significantly by reducing their weight; increasing physical activity; eating a heart-&#173;healthy diet that is rich in &#173;whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and fish; and working with a health care provider or dietitian to monitor and manage blood glucose, blood cholesterol, and blood pressure.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Reduction of Risk for Diabetes Mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several clinical &#173;trials have recently shown that the risk of progression from impaired &#173;glucose tolerance to type 2 DM can be markedly reduced (by approximately 50% over several years) through lifestyle modifications such as a combination of diet and exercise therapy. The amount of weight loss and exercise required to achieve this result is surprisingly &#173;modest. For instance, in the Diabetes Prevention Program, patients who &#173;were asked to perform 150 minutes of brisk walking per week (a &#173;little over 20 minutes per day) lost only about 12 pounds of weight on average but reduced their risk of diabetes mellitus development by 50% over 6 months. Other studies have suggested that early pharmacologic intervention with oral hypoglycemic agents also decreases the risk of progression to diabetes mellitus. &#173;There are, as yet, no known ways to prevent type 1 DM, but &#173;trials of interventions to regulate immune response are &#173;under way.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">The importance of glycemic control</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For patients with &#173;either type 1 or type 2 DM, glycemic control is of the utmost importance. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial showed that intensive therapy aimed at maintaining near-&#173;normal glucose levels had a large and beneficial effect on delaying the development and progression of long-&#173;term complications for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. For example, intensive therapy decreased the risk of the development and progression of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy by 40%–76%. The beneficial effects increased over time, but they &#173;were accompanied by a threefold increased risk of hypoglycemia. Thus, intensive therapy is recommended for most patients with type 1 DM, but &#173;these patients should be instructed to self-&#173;monitor their blood glucose levels carefully to prevent hypoglycemic episodes. <span class="xref-local">See also BCSC Section&#160;12</span>, <span class="xref-local_italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Tight glycemic control has a profound effect on the development of complications. The risk of retinopathy progression rises almost exponentially as the HbA<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1c</span> level increases (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-1</span>). However, patients who decrease their HbA<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1c</span> by 1&#160;percentage point (eg, from 8.0% to 7.0%) reduce their risk of retinopathy by approximately 30%, and this benefit also holds for other complications of diabetes mellitus, such as nephropathy and neuropathy. When working with patients with diabetes mellitus, health care providers should emphasize the importance of tight control and encourage patients to achieve it.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For patients with type 1 DM, intensive therapy also provides protection against macrovascular complications such as cardiovascular disease. For patients with type 2 DM, however, the role of glycemic control in reducing cardiovascular risk has not been established. In this group, macrovascular disease may be affected more by other risk &#173;factors, such as smoking, obesity, and lipid abnormalities.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goals of therapy are to alleviate symptoms; to achieve glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid targets; and to prevent acute and chronic complications of DM. The recommended targets for control of type 1 and type 2 DM are similar:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">fasting and preprandial capillary blood glucose 80–130&#160;mg/dL</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">postprandial capillary blood glucose <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>180&#160;mg/dL</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">HbA<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1c</span> <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>6.5%</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This degree of glycemic control has been associated with the lowest risk of microvascular complications in both type 1 and type 2 DM.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Type 1 diabetes mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of type 1 DM requires lifelong insulin replacement and careful coordination of insulin doses with food intake and activity. Insulin can be administered by subcutaneous injection, continuous subcutaneous infusion, or inhalation. A regimen of multiple daily insulin injections that includes basal, premeal, and correction doses is preferred to obtain optimal control in patients. Capillary glucose monitoring 4 times daily, 10–30 minutes before meals and at bedtime, is required for such a regimen.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by means of an insulin pump is widely used in patients with type 1 and, increasingly, with type 2 DM. However, it does not &#173;automatically improve glycemic control without patient self-&#173;management. A typical regimen provides 50% of total daily insulin as basal insulin and the remainder as multiple preprandial boluses of insulin using a programmable insulin pump. Patients must check their blood glucose regularly &#173;because diabetic ketoacidosis can occur rapidly if the insulin infusion is disrupted.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Regular &#173;human insulin is now available in inhaled form as Technosphere insulin (Afrezza). The onset of effect occurs about 15 minutes &#173;after administration, with a peak effect in the first hour and a duration of action of 3 hours. It is contraindicated in patients with asthma or COPD &#173;because of the risk of bronchospasm. Pulmonary function tests are required prior to initiation of therapy and at regular intervals during therapy.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h4-head">Pancreas transplantation</span> For patients with type 1 DM, pancreas transplantation can be performed alone or in conjunction with kidney transplantation. With modern techniques and immunosuppression, the transplant survival rate is high, and most patients become euglycemic without the need for insulin. Although quality of life is usually improved, the patient &#173;faces risks both from the surgery and from long-&#173;term immunosuppression. Thus, pancreas transplantation alone is limited to specific situations, such as in patients with frequent metabolic complications or in whom standard insulin therapy consistently fails to control disease. However, when pancreas transplantation and kidney transplantation are combined in patients with end-&#173;stage renal disease, the benefits far outweigh the risks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Transplantation of pancreatic islet cells has been shown to improve the quality of life for patients with type 1 DM that is difficult to control, which includes patients with DM with frequent episodes of severe and potentially fatal hypoglycemia. &#173;These cells can be injected directly into the liver without the need for formal transplantation. &#173;After injection, patients remain on lifelong immunosuppression therapy to prevent transplant rejection. A recent phase 3 clinical trial funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), both part of the National Institutes of Health, released results from a study of pancreatic islet cell transplantation. At 1-&#173;year follow-up &#173;after transplant, 88% of transplant recipients had no episodes of severe hypoglycemia and approximately 50% of recipients no longer needed insulin use to achieve glycemic control.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Type 2 diabetes mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The achievement of glycemic control requires individualized therapy in a comprehensive approach that incorporates lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions. Following are considerations for noninsulin therapy in patients with type 2 DM:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Noninsulin therapy should be considered early in the course of the disease, in conjunction with diet and exercise. Metformin is the recommended first-&#173;line therapy if tolerated.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">When used as monotherapy at the maximum dose, insulin secretagogues, metformin, and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have comparable glucose-&#173;lowering effects. The glucose-&#173;lowering effects of &#173;these medi&#173;cations and analogues are observed within days to weeks, except for the maximum effect of TZDs, which may not be apparent for several weeks to months.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Combination therapy with 2 or more oral or injectable agents may be needed to achieve targets for HbA<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1C</span> and blood glucose in patients presenting with significant hyperglycemia and &#173;will likely become necessary as <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;cell function deteriorates over time. Dual therapy may be considered when the initial HbA<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1C</span> is <span class="symbol">≥</span>7.5%, and &#173;triple therapy or insulin when the initial HbA<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1C</span> is <span class="symbol">&gt;</span>9%.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">Because all noninsulin therapies require some pancreatic <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;cell function to achieve glucose-&#173;lowering effects, many patients &#173;will eventually need insulin replacement therapy.<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-10">American Diabetes Association. <span class="italic">Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes—2017.

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Complications of Diabetes Mellitus</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Acute complications of diabetes mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The acute complications of diabetes mellitus are <span class="italic">nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar </span><span class="italic">coma</span> and <span class="italic">diabetic ketoacidosis.</span> &#173;Either of &#173;these, if not recognized promptly and treated aggressively, can lead to death. &#173;These complications should be considered as part of a continuum of hyperglycemia rather than as separate entities; the main difference between the 2 is &#173;whether ketoacids accumulate. Both are often precipitated by some type of stress, such as an infection, that leads to increased production of glucagon, catecholamines, and cortisol, which in turn promotes gluconeogenesis. If not treated with adequate amounts of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, the elevated glucose level &#173;will lead to osmotic diuresis and &#173;volume depletion. When insulin levels are extremely low or absent (eg, in a patient with type 1 DM), catabolic pro&#173;cesses (eg, conversion of lipids to ketones) prevail and keto&#173;acids are produced, superimposing severe metabolic acidosis on the hyperosmotic volume-&#173;depleted state.</p>
			<p class="h3">Long-&#173;term complications of diabetes mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The long-&#173;term complications of DM are usually secondary to vascular disease. Nephropathy, neuropathy, peripheral artery disease, coronary atherosclerosis, secondary ce&#173;re&#173;bral thrombosis, cardiac infarction, and retinopathy are all impor&#173;tant &#173;causes of morbidity and mortality. The precise mechanism for the development of diabetic complications is elusive, but hyperglycemia plays a central role by triggering a number of pro&#173;cesses that ultimately cause vascular damage. (Diabetic retinopathy is discussed in <span class="xref-local">BCSC Section&#160;12,</span> <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous.</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text">The blood glucose level is not the only risk &#173;factor that can be modified to reduce the complications of DM. In par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, hypertension and lipid abnormalities seem to be inextricably intertwined with glycemic control. Thus, any attempt to minimize complications must include aggressive control of &#173;these other &#173;factors.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Nephropathy</span> Approximately 40% of patients who have had DM for 20 or more years have nephropathy. Albuminuria greater than 300&#160;mg/24 hours—&#173;approximately the level at which a standard urine dipstick test becomes positive—is the hallmark of diabetic nephropathy. Renal failure eventually occurs in approximately 50% of patients who developed diabetes mellitus before age 20 and in 6% of &#173;those with onset &#173;after 40&#160;years of age. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-&#173;stage renal disease, and the 5-&#173;year survival rate of patients with DM on maintenance dialysis is less than 20%. Almost invariably, nephropathy and retinopathy develop within a short time of each other.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The progression of diabetic nephropathy occurs in the following sequence: microalbuminuria (urine albumin levels of 30–300&#160;mg/24 hours), macroalbuminuria (urine albumin levels <span class="symbol">&gt;</span>300&#160;mg/24 hours), nephrotic syndrome, and fi&#173;nally end-&#173;stage renal disease. Tight control of blood glucose can delay and perhaps prevent the development of microalbuminuria. In addition, controlling hypertension (particularly with angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme inhibitors) and adhering to low-&#173;protein diets may help slow the decline in glomerular filtration rate.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Neuropathy</span> Diabetic neuropathy is a common prob&#173;lem. &#173;After 30&#160;years of DM, about 50% of patients have signs of neuropathy, and 15%–20% have symptoms of distal symmetric polyneuropathy. Changes in nerve metabolism and function are thought to be mediated in part through increased aldose reductase activity; Schwann cell synthesis of myelin is impaired, and axonal degeneration ensues. In addition, microangiopathy of the endoneural capillaries leads to vascular abnormalities and microinfarcts of the nerves, with multi&#173;focal fiber loss.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Symptoms in the feet and lower legs are the most common manifestations. Foot pain,&#160;paresthesias, and loss of sensation occur frequently and prob&#173;ably result from both &#173;ischemic and metabolic nerve abnormalities. Weakness may be pres&#173;ent as part of mononeuritis or a mononeuritis multiplex and is usually associated with pain. Cranial neuropathies may also occur (<span class="xref-local">see BCSC Section&#160;5,</span> <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>). Additional types of morbidity, stemming from autonomic dysfunction, include male and female sexual dysfunction, impaired urination, delayed gastric emptying, orthostatic hypotension, and tachycardia due to loss of vagal tone.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There is no specific treatment for diabetic neuropathy. Aldose reductase inhibitors (not yet commercially available) may improve nerve conduction slightly but do not result in major clinical improvement. Neuropathic pain may respond to tricyclic antidepressants or capsaicin cream. Anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine and gabapentin may also be useful.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h4-head">Large-&#173;vessel disease</span> The risk of coronary heart disease is 2–10 times higher in patients with DM than in the general population, and the mortality rate in patients with DM who have anterior myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarctions is twice that in patients who do not have DM. &#173;Because myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction may pres&#173;ent without the classic symptom of chest pain in patients with DM, an increased index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis. Hypertension further increases the risk of cardiovascular disease for persons with DM. Ce&#173;re&#173;bral thrombosis is approximately twice as prevalent in the diabetic population as in the nondiabetic population, and peripheral artery disease is 40 times as prevalent.</p>

The ophthalmologist may be the first to identify a complication related to a patient’s diabetes, &#173;whether diabetic retinopathy or a transient refractive change due to glucose elevation. Moreover, an ophthalmologist may be a patient’s only regular health care provider. Thus, it is impor&#173;tant that both the patient and the ophthalmologist are aware of the patient’s HbA<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">1c</span> level, a specific and objective mea&#173;sure of glycemic control.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">Patients may need to be educated about frequent blood glucose testing, &#173;the&#160;paramount importance of maintaining good glycemic control, and the &#173;<br />pos&#173;si&#173;ble consequences of poor control. In addition, patients should be reminded that other modifiable risk &#173;factors for retinopathy progression, including hypertension, lipid abnormalities, early renal failure, and anemia, are also impor&#173;tant.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">It is impor&#173;tant for the ophthalmologist to be aware of the patient’s glycemic control status, &#173;because it may affect the rate of retinopathy progression and, in turn, influence decisions on treatment and follow-up frequency. For example, studies have shown that rapid improvement in glycemic control can hasten progression of retinopathy. This finding is in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent of cataract surgery, and the mechanism of action is not fully understood. Therefore, attempting to rapidly improve glycemic control in a patient prior to cataract surgery may not be beneficial, as it may speed the progression of retinopathy and affect visual outcomes.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">The importance of all of the risk &#173;factors for retinopathy progression should be communicated to the patient’s primary care physician so that &#173;these &#173;factors can be controlled as well as pos&#173;si&#173;ble. The ophthalmologist should strive to keep informed on the status of &#173;these issues, &#173;because a patient with significant &#173;<br />prob&#173;lems in any of &#173;these areas is likely to have less-&#173;than-&#173;optimal results with any ophthalmic surgical intervention. Educating patients who have poorly controlled DM about their prognosis before surgery may facilitate more realistic expectations.

			<p class="h1">Thyroid Disease</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Physiology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Functionally, the thyroid gland can be thought of as having 2 parts. The <span class="italic">parafollicular</span> (or C) cells secrete calcitonin and play a role in calcium homeostasis; they do not affect thyroid physiology. Thyroid <span class="italic">follicles</span> are made up of a single layer of epithelial cells surrounding colloid, which consists mostly of thyroglobulin, the storage form of the thyroid hormones T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> and T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> (thyroxine), the main secretory product of the thyroid gland, contains 4 iodine atoms. Deiodination of T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span>, which occurs mainly in the liver and kidneys, gives rise to T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> (triiodothyronine), the metabolically active form of thyroid hormone. Eighty &#173;percent of serum T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> is derived through deiodination; the remainder is secreted by the thyroid. Only a small fraction of &#173;these hormones circulates freely in the plasma (0.02% of total T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> and 0.30% of total T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>); the remainder is bound to the proteins thyroxine-&#173;binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin, and albumin.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thyroid function is regulated by the interrelationship of hypothalamic, pituitary, and&#160;thyroid activity. Thyrotropin-&#173;releasing hormone (TRH), which is secreted by the hypothalamus, &#173;causes the synthesis of thyrotropin (or thyroid-&#173;stimulating hormone, TSH) and its release from the anterior pituitary. TSH, in turn, stimulates the thyroid, leading to the release of T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> and T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>. In this negative-&#173;feedback loop, increased levels of T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> and T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> inhibit the release of TSH and the TSH response to TRH at the level of the pituitary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The main role of the thyroid hormones is regulation of tissue metabolism through their effects on protein synthesis. Normal development of the central ner&#173;vous system requires adequate amounts of thyroid hormone during the first 2&#160;years of life. Congenital hypothyroidism results in irreversible cognitive disabilities (cretinism). Normal growth and bone maturation also depend on sufficient hormone levels.</p>
			<p class="h2">Tests of Thyroid Function</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Detection of thyroid disease and evaluation of the efficacy of therapy require the use of vari&#173;ous combinations of laboratory tests. The American Thyroid Association recommends initial screening with tests of TSH and &#173;free T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3">Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of serum TSH</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Thyroid-&#173;stimulating hormone secretion by the pituitary is tightly controlled by negative-&#173;feedback mechanisms regulated by serum T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> and T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> levels. TSH levels begin to rise early in the course of hypothyroidism and fall in hyperthyroidism, even before &#173;free T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> levels are outside the reference range. Therefore, the serum TSH level is a sensitive indicator of thyroid dysfunction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some extremely sensitive assays of TSH can detect levels down to 0.005 mIU/L, making it pos&#173;si&#173;ble to differentiate low normal values from abnormally low values. The TSH test is useful for (1) screening for thyroid disease, (2) monitoring replacement therapy in hypo&#173;thyroid patients (TSH levels respond 6–8 weeks &#173;after changes in hormone replacement dosage), and (3) monitoring suppressive therapy for thyroid nodules or cancer. In screening for thyroid disease, the combination of &#173;free T<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">4</span> and sensitive TSH assays has a sensitivity of  99.5% and a specificity of 98.0%. As a result, both of &#173;these tests are used together for screening in most situations. &#173;There is presently some controversy about the upper limit of normal for TSH, so endocrinologic consultation is indicated in borderline cases.</p>
			<p class="h3">Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of serum T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Total serum T<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">4</span> comprises 2 parts: the protein-&#173;bound fraction and the &#173;free hormone. Total T<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">4</span> levels can be affected by changes in serum TBG levels, while euthyroidism is maintained and &#173;free T<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">4</span> levels remain normal. Levels of TBG and total T<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">4</span> are elevated during pregnancy and with use of oral contraceptives, while &#173;free T<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">4</span> levels remain normal. Low TBG and total T<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">4</span> levels are associated with chronic illness, protein malnutrition, hepatic failure, and use of glucocorticoids.</p>
			<p class="h3">Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of serum T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Serum T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> levels may not accurately reflect thyroid gland function for 2 reasons: first, T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> is not the major secretory product of the thyroid; and, second, many &#173;factors influence T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> levels, including nutrition, medi&#173;cations, and mechanisms regulating the enzymes that convert T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> to T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>. Determination of T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> levels is indicated in patients who may have T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> thyrotoxicosis, an uncommon condition in which clinically hyperthyroid patients have normal T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> and &#173;free T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> but elevated T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> levels.</p>
			<p class="h3">Thyroid hormone–&#173;binding protein tests</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Radioactive iodine uptake testing can be used to distinguish Graves disease from other &#173;causes of hyperthyroidism in the absence of other clinical features of Graves disease. However, it is not routinely performed.</p>
			<p class="h3">Thyroid antibody tests</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several antibodies against thyroid antigens can be detected in the blood. The most common is thyroid peroxidase antibody<span class="italic">,</span> which has 99% sensitivity and specificity for Graves disease. Antibodies to thyroglobulin are also found in vari&#173;ous thyroid diseases, including Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves disease, and thyroid carcinoma. Patients with Graves disease usually have antibodies called thyroid-&#173;stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs), which are directed at TSH receptors. &#173;These antibodies generally stimulate the release of thyroid hormone, but in rare cases patients have antibodies that block thyroid hormone release. High serum levels of TSI and the absence of thyroperoxidase antibody are both risk &#173;factors for ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves disease.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Thyroid scanning</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Thyroid scanning is useful in distinguishing functioning from nonfunctioning thyroid nodules and in evaluating chest and neck masses for metastatic thyroid cancer.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Thyroid ultrasonography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ultrasonography, which can detect nodules as small as 1&#160;mm, is used to identify the presence of cystic or solid thyroid nodules.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Biopsy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Biopsy to obtain tissue samples for evaluating thyroid nodules may be performed with fine-&#173;needle aspiration, core, or excisional techniques. Fine-&#173;needle aspiration specimens require interpretation by an experienced cytologist.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Hyperthyroidism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hypermetabolism caused by excessive quantities of circulating thyroid hormones leads to the clinical syndrome of <span class="italic">hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis).</span> Clinical findings include exophthalmos, chest palpitations, excessive sweating, diarrhea, weight loss, and sensitivity to heat. Graves hyperthyroidism accounts for approximately 85% of cases of thyrotoxicosis. Toxic nodular goiter and thyroiditis account for most of the remaining cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Thyroid storm</span> is a rare, acute hypermetabolic state that is fatal if untreated. It is often precipitated by surgery, infection, or trauma in a patient with other&#173;wise mild hyperthyroidism. Patients typically pres&#173;ent with fever, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and psychosis; and they may become comatose secondary to hypotension. Modern treatments aimed at controlling the pro&#173;cess have dramatically reduced mortality.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Graves hyperthyroidism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Thyroid eye disease (TED)</span> is discussed in <span class="xref-local">BCSC Section&#160;5,</span> <span class="xref-local_italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> and <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;7,</span> <span class="italic">Oculofacial Plastic and Orbital Surgery.</span> This section focuses on the thyroid disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with Graves hyperthyroidism (also known as <span class="italic">diffuse toxic goiter</span>) exhibit vari&#173;ous combinations of hypermetabolism, diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, TED, and infiltrative dermopathy. Graves hyperthyroidism is an autoimmune disorder. Up to 90% of patients have circulating TSH receptor antibodies; furthermore, the level of TSI has been shown to correlate with the severity of clinical disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Graves hyperthyroidism is common, with a lifetime risk of 3.0% for &#173;women and 0.5% for men. The incidence peaks in the third to fifth de&#173;cades of life, and &#173;there is a strong &#173;familial component. Risk &#173;factors including stress and smoking are associated with increased incidence of thyroid eye disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Common clinical symptoms include fatigue, tremor, weight loss, palpitations, and heat intolerance. Manifestations can vary by age of patient at the onset of hyperthyroidism. For instance, atrial fibrillation is rare in patients younger than 60&#160;years but occurs in more than 10% of patients 60&#160;years or older. A palpable goiter develops in most patients younger than 60&#160;years old compared with less than 50% of patients older than 60&#160;years. Approximately one-&#173;third of patients with Graves hyperthyroidism have clinically obvious TED at the time of diagnosis of the hyperthyroidism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of Graves hyperthyroidism is aimed at returning thyroid function to normal. A significant proportion of patients (30%–50%) experience remission in association with drug treatment directed at the thyroid. &#173;Later in the course of the disease, patients may experience relapse, hypothyroidism, or both.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thyroid secretion is suppressed using one of the thiourea derivatives, propylthiouracil or methimazole. The drugs inhibit the use of iodine by the gland. Treatment is continued &#173;until clinical and laboratory indexes show improvement. Adverse effects include rash (common), liver damage (rare), vasculitis (rare), and agranulocytosis (occurs in 0.02%–0.05% of patients).</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There are several options for long-&#173;term management of Graves hyperthyroidism: the aforementioned antithyroid drugs can be continued for 12–24 months in hopes of remission; part of the gland can be surgically removed, although approximately half of such patients eventually become hypothyroid; or radioactive iodine can be used. Iodine 131 (<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">131</span>I) is highly effective, resulting in hypothyroidism in 80% of patients within 6–12 months; some require a second treatment. Although adverse effects of <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">131</span>I are minimal, its use is associated with worsening of TED.</p>

			<p class="h3">Toxic nodular goiter</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In toxic nodular goiter, thyroid hormone–&#173;producing adenomas (&#173;either single or multiple) make enough hormone to cause hyperthyroidism. &#173;These so-&#173;called <span class="italic">hot nodules</span> are almost never carcinomatous and often result in hyperthyroidism. Toxic nodules may be treated with radioactive iodine or surgery.</p>
			<p class="h2">Hypothyroidism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Hypothyroidism</span> is a clinical syndrome resulting from a deficiency of thyroid hormone. &#173;<span class="italic">Myxedema</span> is the nonpitting edema caused by subcutaneous accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in severe cases of hypothyroidism; the term is sometimes used to describe the entire syndrome of severe hypothyroidism.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Primary hypothyroidism</span> accounts for more than 95% of cases and may be congenital or acquired. Most primary cases are due to Hashimoto thyroiditis (discussed in the following section), “idiopathic” myxedema (thought by many to be end-&#173;stage Hashimoto thyroiditis), and iatrogenic &#173;causes (<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">131</span>I or surgical treatment of hyperthyroidism). <span class="italic">Secondary hypothyroidism,</span> caused by hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction (usually &#173;after pituitary surgery), is much less common. As in hyperthyroidism, the female preponderance among adults is significant. <span class="italic">Subclinical hypothyroidism</span> is defined as a normal T<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">4</span> concentration and a slightly elevated TSH level. &#173;These patients may or may not have symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, and some controversy surrounds &#173;whether such patients should be treated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinically, a patient with hypothyroidism pres&#173;ents with signs and symptoms of hypometabolism and accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in the tissues of the body. Many of the symptoms are nonspecific—&#173;they include weakness, fatigue, memory loss, dry skin, hair loss, deepening of the voice, weight gain (despite loss of appetite), cold intolerance, arthralgias, constipation, and muscle cramps—&#173;and their relationship to thyroid dysfunction may not be recognized for some time. Clinical signs include bradycardia, reduced pulse pressure, myxedema, weight gain, loss of body and scalp hair, and menstrual disorders. In severe cases, personality changes (“myxedema psychosis”) and death (following “myxedema coma”) may occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of hypothyroidism is straightforward, consisting of oral thyroid replacement medi&#173;cation to normalize circulating hormone levels. Levothyroxine is the most commonly used preparation. Serum T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> and TSH levels are monitored at regular intervals to ensure that euthyroidism is maintained.</p>
			<p class="h2">Thyroiditis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Thyroiditis</span> may be classified as acute, subacute, or chronic. <span class="italic">Acute thyroiditis,</span> caused by bacterial infection, is extremely rare. <span class="italic">Subacute thyroiditis</span> occurs in 2 forms: granulomatous and lymphocytic. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common type of <span class="italic">chronic thyroiditis.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with <span class="italic">subacute granulomatous thyroiditis</span> pres&#173;ent with a painful, enlarged gland associated with fever, chills, and malaise. Thyroid function tests may be helpful &#173;because they may reveal the unusual combination of an elevated T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> level and a low radioactive iodine uptake. Patients may be hyperthyroid &#173;because of the release of hormone from areas of thyroid destruction; pathologic examination reveals granulomatous inflammation. The disease is self-&#173;limited, and treatment is symptomatic, with use of &#173;either analgesics or, in severe cases, oral corticosteroids. &#173;After resolution, transient hypothyroidism (which becomes permanent in 5%–10% of patients) may occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with <span class="italic">subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis</span> (“painless” thyroiditis), which commonly occurs 2–4 months postpartum in &#173;mothers but may occur in isolation, pres&#173;ent with symptoms of hyperthyroidism and a normal or slightly enlarged but nontender thyroid gland. Pathologic investigation shows lymphocytic infiltration resembling Hashimoto thyroiditis, suggesting an autoimmune cause. This disease is also self-&#173;limited, generally lasting less than 3 months, and treatment is symptomatic. Hypothyroidism may ensue.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Hashimoto thyroiditis</span> is an autoimmune disease that &#173;causes goitrous hypothyroidism. Patients have antibodies to thyroid antigens and an increased incidence of other auto&#173;immune diseases. Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis may pres&#173;ent with hypothyroidism, an enlarged thyroid, or both. Pathologic examination reveals lymphocytic infiltration. Treatment is aimed at normalizing hormone levels with thyroid replacement therapy. &#173;Patients with enlarged glands and airway obstruction who do not respond to TSH &#173;suppression may require surgery. The risk of primary thyroid lymphoma and papillary thyroid cancer is slightly increased in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Postpartum thyroiditis</span> occurs in approximately 5% of &#173;women &#173;after delivery (often in subsequent pregnancies) and can cause hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism (or first one prob&#173;lem and then the other). Postpartum thyroiditis is usually painless and self-&#173;limited and is often associated with thyroid peroxidase antibodies.</p>
			<p class="h2">Thyroid Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Virtually all tumors of the thyroid gland arise from glandular cells and are, therefore, &#173;adenomas or carcinomas. Functioning adenomas &#173;were discussed previously (<span class="xref-local">see the sec</span><span class="xref-local">tion “Toxic nodular goiter”</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">On thyroid scan, 90%–95% of thyroid adenomas are cold nodules and come to attention only if they are large enough to be physically apparent. Diagnostic testing involves a combination of approaches, including ultrasonography (cysts are benign and simply aspirated), fine-&#173;needle aspiration, and surgery, depending on the clinical situation. Treatment options for benign cold nodules are suppressive therapy, in which thyroid hormone replacement is used to suppress TSH secretion and its stimulatory effect on functioning nodules, and surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There are 4 types of carcinomas of the thyroid: papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic (undifferentiated). <span class="italic">Papillary carcinoma</span> is the most common form of thyroid tumor. Tumors removed before extension outside the capsule of the gland appear to have no adverse effect on survival. <span class="italic">Follicular carcinoma</span> may also be associated with a normal life span if it is identified before it becomes invasive, but late metastases can occur. <span class="italic">Medullary carcinoma</span> arises from the C cells and produces calcitonin. The lesion can occur as a solitary malignant tumor or as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (<span class="xref-local">discussed at the end of the chapter</span>). <span class="italic">Anaplastic carcinoma,</span> though rare, is the most malignant tumor of the thyroid gland and is found mainly in patients older than 60&#160;years. For the &#173;giant cell form, the survival time is less than 6 months from time of diagnosis; for the small cell form, the 5-&#173;year survival rate is 20%–25%.</p>

			<p class="h1">Disorders of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">hypothalamus</span> is the coordinating center of the endocrine system. It consolidates signals from higher cortical centers, the autonomic ner&#173;vous system, the environment, and systemic endocrine feedback. The hypothalamus then delivers precise instructions to the pituitary gland, which releases hormones that influence most endocrine systems in the body. The hypothalamic-&#173;pituitary axis directly affects the thyroid gland, the adrenal gland, and the gonads; and it influences growth, milk production, and &#173;water balance.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;2-1</span> outlines the major hypothalamic hormones and their actions on the anterior pituitary hormones. The hypothalamic hormones are released directly into a primary capillary plexus that empties into the hypophyseal portal venous circulation; they then travel down the pituitary stalk and bathe the anterior pituitary gland in a secondary capillary plexus. The hormones released by the hypothalamic neurons, therefore, reach their target cells rapidly and in high concentrations. This proximity allows a rapid, pulsatile response to signals between the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is controlled by direct neuronal innervation from the hypothalamus rather than by blood-&#173;borne hormones. The main products of the posterior pituitary are vasopressin and oxytocin. <span class="italic">Vasopressin</span> (antidiuretic hormone) is primarily involved in controlling &#173;water excretion by the kidneys. <span class="italic">Oxytocin</span> stimulates uterine contractions during &#173;labor and delivery and milk ejection in lactation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Pituitary Adenomas</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pituitary tumors account for 10%–15% of intracranial tumors. They are classified as <span class="italic">microadenomas</span> (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>10&#160;mm in the greatest dia&#173;meter) or <span class="italic">macroadenomas</span> (<span class="symbol">≥</span>10&#160;mm in the greatest dia&#173;meter). Typically benign, &#173;these tumors arise from hormone-&#173;producing cells and may be functionally active (ie, secrete large amounts of hormones) or inactive. The clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion depends on what type of cell the tumor derives from and &#173;whether the tumor produces hormones. Any type of tumor may be clinically inactive and &#173;will become apparent only when it has enlarged enough to cause symptoms. Patients may pres&#173;ent with headaches, visual symptoms such as visual field loss due to chiasmal compression, cranial neuropathies, and/or hypopituitarism from compression of normal pituitary tissue. (The ophthalmic effects of pituitary adenomas and other parasellar lesions are discussed in <span class="xref-local">BCSC Section&#160;5,</span> <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text">Accounting for approximately 15% of pituitary tumors, <span class="italic">somatotroph adenomas</span> produce growth hormone, which can cause gigantism in prepubertal patients and acromegaly in adults. Acromegaly often develops insidiously over several years, and patients may pres&#173;ent with headaches and visual symptoms due to enlargement of the adenoma before the diagnosis is recognized. Characteristic findings include an enlarged jaw, coarse facial features, and enlarged and swollen hands and feet. Patients may also have cardiac disease and diabetes mellitus in addition to the typical bone and soft-&#173;tissue changes.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Lactotroph adenomas (prolactinomas)</span> account for approximately 25% of symptomatic pituitary tumors. Hyperprolactinemia produces amenorrhea and galactorrhea in &#173;women and decreased libido and impotence in men. The symptoms tend to develop gradually in men, and patients may pres&#173;ent with compression symptoms due to tumor enlargement before the hormonal effects are recognized.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Thyrotroph adenomas</span> are rare, accounting for less than 1% of pituitary tumors. They may cause hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or no change in thyroid function, depending on how the TSH subunits are pro&#173;cessed in the tumor cells. &#173;These tumors tend to be large macroadenomas, and patients may pres&#173;ent with compressive symptoms in addition to any thyroid changes.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Corticotroph adenomas</span> account for approximately 15% of pituitary tumors. They are associated with <span class="italic">Cushing syndrome</span>, characterized by the classic features of centripetal obesity, hirsutism, and facial plethora. Fat deposits develop over the thoracocervical spine (buffalo hump) and temporal regions (moon facies). Psychiatric abnormalities occur in 50% of patients, and long-&#173;standing Cushing syndrome can cause osteoporosis. Patients bruise easily and have violet striae on the abdomen, upper thighs, and arms. Hypertension and glucose intolerance leading to diabetes mellitus can also occur. Cushing syndrome can also develop secondary to adrenal gland neoplasms and, most commonly, from iatrogenic administration of glucocorticoids.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Gonadotroph adenomas</span> (approximately 10% of pituitary tumors) may produce serum follicle-&#173;stimulating hormone and, in rare cases, luteinizing hormone. Affected patients pres&#173;ent with hypogonadism related to gonadal downregulation. Gonadotropin-&#173;producing pituitary tumors may also be clinically inactive, and patients may pres&#173;ent with compression symptoms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Accounting for approximately 15% of pituitary tumors, <span class="italic">plurihormonal adenomas,</span> as the name implies, produce more than 1 type of hormone. Common combinations include elevated growth hormone with prolactin and growth hormone with TSH.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Null-&#173;cell adenomas</span> (approximately 20% of pituitary tumors) do not have any pathologic markers to suggest a certain cell type and do not produce excess hormone. Most tumors that pres&#173;ent with signs of enlargement and compression are gonadotroph or null-&#173;cell adenomas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tumors of the pituitary gland are best diagnosed by means of contrast magnetic resonance imaging focused on the pituitary region. Endocrinologic testing is warranted when hypersecretion syndromes are suspected or when the patient has evidence of hypopituitarism. The treatment approach is complex and depends on a number of &#173;factors, including the size of the tumor and the nature of the hormonal activity. Treatment is discussed further in <span class="xref-local">BCSC Section&#160;5,</span> <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Pituitary Apoplexy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pituitary apoplexy results from hemorrhage or infarction in a pituitary adenoma; it can occur spontaneously or &#173;after head trauma. In its most dramatic pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, apoplexy &#173;causes the sudden onset of excruciating headache, visual field loss, diplopia due to pressure on the oculomotor nerves, and hypopituitarism. Any type of pituitary hormone deficiency can occur, but cortisol deficiency is the most serious &#173;because it can cause life-&#173;threatening hypotension. Imaging of the pituitary may show intra-&#173;adenomal hemorrhage and deviation of the pituitary stalk. Most patients recover but experience long-&#173;term pituitary insufficiency. Signs of reduced vision and altered &#173;mental status are indications for transsphenoidal surgical decompression. Ophthalmologists need to be aware of this entity &#173;because of the high incidence of visual symptoms on pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-15">Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndromes</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes</span> are rare hereditary disorders of benign and malignant endocrine neoplasms. &#173;There are 2 syndromes, MEN 1 and MEN 2. Both are typically autosomal dominant, but sporadic cases exist. MEN 2 is further divided into types 2A, 2B (Figs 2-2, 2-3), and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) alone.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common features of MEN 1 are parathyroid, enteropancreatic, and pitu&#173;itary &#173;tumors. Hyperparathyroidism is the most common endocrine abnormality. Enteropancreatic tumors include <span class="italic">gastrinomas</span>, which cause increased gastric acid output (Zollinger-&#173;Ellison syndrome), and <span class="italic">insulinomas</span>, which cause fasting hypoglycemia. Pituitary adenomas can also be pres&#173;ent; they are usually prolactinomas, but other types can occur. Carcinoid and adrenal tumors can develop as well.</p>
			<p class="body-text">MEN 2A and 2B are characterized by the presence of MTC, which occurs in 90%–100% of patients and is the main cause of morbidity. The lifetime incidence of pheochromocytoma is approximately 50%. Hyperparathyroidism is seen in approximately 20%–30% of patients with MEN 2A but is rarely seen in patients with MEN 2B.</p>
			<p class="body-text">MEN 2B is characterized by ganglioneuromas, which occur in 95% of patients. They can be pres&#173;ent on the lips, eyelids, and tongue, giving &#173;these patients a characteristic phenotype that may be apparent at birth. Patients with MEN 2B may also have marfanoid features including pectus excavatum and scoliosis, but without lens subluxation and aortic disease. The eyelid margins may be nodular as a result of multiple small tumors (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-2</span>); subconjunctival neuromas have also been reported. Perhaps the most striking ophthalmic finding is the presence of prominent corneal nerves in a clear stroma (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-3</span>), a phenomenon reported in 100% of cases. &#173;Because MTC may not appear &#173;until the patient’s second or third de&#173;cade, ophthalmic manifestations may be the initial sign of MEN 2B, making ophthalmologists potentially instrumental in the diagnosis of this disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The management of MEN depends on the nature of the tumors and usually involves medical treatment to control hormonal effects and/or surgical excision when pos&#173;si&#173;ble. The genes that cause all types of MEN have been located, and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing can identify patients at risk. Identification of affected &#173;family members is particularly impor&#173;tant in MEN 2 &#173;because prophylactic thyroidectomy can decrease the risk of death from MTC. Screening for pheochromocytoma is also warranted in order to identify prob&#173;lems that could lead to the development of complications such as hypertension.</p>
