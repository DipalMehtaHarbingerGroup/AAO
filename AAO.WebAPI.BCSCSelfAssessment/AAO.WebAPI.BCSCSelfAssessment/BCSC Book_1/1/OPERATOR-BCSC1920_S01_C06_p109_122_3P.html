			<p class="h1">Introduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Stroke is the third leading cause of death in developed countries, ranking &#173;behind heart disease and cancer. In the United States, it is the fifth leading cause of death. From 2000 to 2010, the relative rate of stroke death decreased by 35.8% in the United States, and the &#173;actual number of US stroke deaths declined by 22.8%; yet the number of strokes occurring annually in the United States remains approximately 795,000, of which 610,000 are first attacks. Each year, approximately 129,000 individuals die in the United States as a result of ischemic stroke. Better control of hypertension, cholesterol levels, and diabetes mellitus, as well as increases in smoking cessation, have contributed to this reduction in stroke mortality rates. The annual incidence of ischemic stroke has increased in Eastern Eu&#173;rope, China, and other nations where improved economic status is accompanied by a widespread adoption of unhealthful lifestyles. Stroke is the leading cause of long-&#173;term disability in the United States &#173;today.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There are 2 primary types of stroke: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke accounts for about 87% of cerebrovascular accidents.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Cerebral Ischemia</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia results from interference with blood circulation to the brain. The ischemic event can occur as a result of intrinsic vessel pathology that leads to thrombosis; embolic phenomena; or systemic hypoperfusion. Ce&#173;re&#173;bral circulation is usually maintained by a very efficient collateral arterial system that includes the 2 carotid and the 2 &#173;vertebral arteries, anastomoses in the circle of Willis, and collateral circulation in the ce&#173;re&#173;bral hemi&#173;spheres. However, atheromas and congenital arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can lead to a reduction in ce&#173;re&#173;bral blood flow. This reduction may be generalized or localized. Interruptions in ce&#173;re&#173;bral blood flow can result in permanent neurologic deficits, depending on the extent and duration of the ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Transient Ce&#173;re&#173;bral Ischemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Transient ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia (TCI)</span> is now defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal ischemia <span class="italic">without</span> infarction. The previous, time-&#173;based definition of TCI (formerly referred to as a transient ischemic attack), which described the episode as a sudden-&#173;onset focal loss of neurologic function, persisting for less than 24 hours, is inadequate; infarction can occur even &#173;after a brief period of ischemia, even if the presenting focal neurologic symptoms resolve in less than 1 hour. The new term TCI, with its tissue-&#173;based definition, more accurately reflects its pathophysiology and encourages the use of diagnostic testing to identify evidence of permanent tissue injury. The presence of acute infarction is a strong predictor of a recurrent ischemic stroke. The occurrence of TCI is not only an impor&#173;tant prognostic indicator for a &#173;future stroke but is also associated with a rising mortality over time. Most TCIs last only a few minutes, and the symptoms are primarily associated with insufficiency of the internal carotid, &#173;middle ce&#173;re&#173;bral, or vertebrobasilar arterial territories.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Ischemic Stroke</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A <span class="italic">completed stroke</span> is an ischemic event that produces a stable, permanent neurologic disability. Most <span class="italic">ischemic strokes</span> consist of small regions of complete ischemia in conjunction with a larger area of incomplete ischemia. This ischemic but not infarcted area is called the <span class="italic">penumbra.</span> The penumbra is dynamic, resulting in changes to the previously passive treatment approach in patients with acute ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia. Clinical manifestations of ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia reflect the functions associated with the area of ischemia and include paresis, paresthesia, vision loss, language disturbances, vertigo, diplopia, ataxia, dysarthria, headache, nausea, and vomiting.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Emboli or thrombi caused by atherosclerosis, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus and located in large, medium, and small arteries account for most strokes. Strokes caused by emboli of cardiac origin account for 20% of total ischemic stroke incidence. Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of cardioembolic strokes, occurring in up to 20% of &#173;these patients. Mural thrombi forming on the endocardium in conjunction with myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction (MI) account for 8%–10% of total stroke incidence worldwide. Other cardiac conditions associated with intracranial embolism include mitral stenosis and atrial myxoma. Ce&#173;re&#173;bral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), which is a rare ge&#173;ne&#173;tic small-&#173;vessel vasculopathy, can mimic multiple sclerosis and cause ischemic stroke.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nonarteriosclerotic &#173;causes of thrombotic occlusion leading to TCI and stroke include internal carotid dissection (causing the classic triad of Horner sign, neck pain/headache, and neurologic signs and symptoms) and inflammatory arteritis (eg, collagen vascular disease, &#173;giant cell arteritis, meningovascular syphilis, acute and chronic meningitis, and moyamoya disease).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another cause of ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia is increased viscosity of the blood due to pregnancy and the postpartum period, use of oral contraceptives, postoperative and posttraumatic states, hyperviscosity syndromes, polycythemia, and sickle cell disease. In addition, stroke may occur as a result of hypoxemia caused by conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, profound anemia, and pulmonary emboli.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnosis and Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The differential diagnosis of ischemic stroke and TCIs includes diabetic and convulsive seizures, migraine, vertigo, and neoplasms. Although the pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of stroke is usually characteristic, the diagnosis should be differentiated from that of other conditions that may mimic strokes, such as multiple sclerosis, subdural hematoma, cranial nerve palsy, encephalitis, hypoglycemia, seizures, brain tumor, hypertensive encephalopathy, syncope, migraine, and functional disorder.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Obtaining a detailed history from the patient, including the time and duration of onset, is impor&#173;tant. Also, an assessment of risk &#173;factors is critical for treating a patient with suspected stroke. Nonmodifiable risk &#173;factors include age older than 60&#160;years, male sex, and &#173;family history or prior history of stroke or TCIs. Modifiable risk &#173;factors include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, smoking, alcohol use, illicit drug use, migraine, and hypercoagulable states.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical severity of a stroke can be determined using the US National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which assesses level of consciousness, gaze, visual fields, facial strength, motor function of the arms and legs, ataxia, sensation, language, dysarthria, and inattention, giving a specified number of points to each impairment found. A scale of 0–42 is used for the assessment, with <span class="italic">0</span> representing normal function and <span class="italic">42</span> representing the most severe functional impairment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients presenting with TCI within 72 hours of the event should be hospitalized if they have a known source of embolic phenomena that is treatable, such as cardiac valvular disease, evidence of acute infarction on initial imaging, and significant concurrent morbidities. Individuals who are not hospitalized should be instructed to undergo diagnostic workup within 48 hours and warned to return to the emergency department if symptoms recur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For practical purposes, diagnostic studies may be separated into &#173;those done in an acute care setting, such as in the emergency department, and &#173;those done in a more subacute setting, such as in a stable inpatient or stable outpatient clinic. Emergent testing assesses the patient’s clinical stability and the possibility of conditions that mimic stroke or conditions that could contribute to stroke; the tests should include blood glucose, complete blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation studies such as PT/aPTT (prothrombin time/activated partial thromboplastin time), international normalized ratio, troponins, and electrocardiogram. Ideally, all suspected cases of stroke and TCI should be evaluated with urgent noncontrast <span class="italic">computed tomography (CT)</span> of the brain, &#173;because contrast and blood appear similar on CT, and this similarity can result in misinterpretation of the image. Noncontrast CT is very sensitive for the presence of intracranial hemorrhage and remains the imaging modality of choice for emergent initial evaluation of stroke. However, enhancement in CT imaging has also improved its diagnostic capability in the evaluation of early ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Investigation of the systemic arteries and the heart is essential in determining the cause of ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia. Differences between upper limb pulse rates and blood pressure (BP) may indicate serious subclavian disease. Multiple bruits may suggest widespread arterial disease but may be pres&#173;ent without significant occlusion. Evidence of a cardioembolic source should be pursued aggressively, especially in younger normotensive persons with ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia and in older patients, for whom atrial fibrillation is included in the differential diagnosis. Electrocardiography and telemetry or Holter monitoring should be routinely performed to exclude cardiac dysrhythmia and occult MI. Echocardiography is often helpful in excluding intracardiac thrombi; transesophageal Doppler echocardio&#173;graphy is most sensitive in this regard. Lumbar puncture is required in the evaluation of stroke or TIA only in rare instances, for example, if meningovascular syphilis, meningitis, or subarachnoid hemorrhage is a serious consideration.</p>
			<p class="h3">Imaging studies for evaluation of ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Updates in imaging techniques have now provided numerous options for the clinician in assessing the presence or absence of tissue injury, tissue at risk, and the anatomy of the regional circulation.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Multimodal computed tomography</span> In multimodal CT, 3 CT modes are combined: non&#173;contrast CT, CT perfusion imaging, and CT angiography. This type of imaging can rule out hemorrhage, permit early detection of acute infarction, and allow assessment of the site of occlusion, infarct core, and salvageable brain tissue. In addition, the angiography mode can assess collateral circulation.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography</span> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than noncontrast CT in detecting an evolving stroke within hours of its onset. <span class="italic">Diffusion-&#173;weighted imaging (DWI)</span> MRI with <span class="italic">apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping</span> is useful in the evaluation of early ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia and regional blood flow to determine the presence or absence of acute infarction. MRI perfusion-&#173;weighted imaging (PWI) assesses transit time of the contrast agent. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can be used to detect vascular stenosis and/or occlusion. Multimodal MRI, which combines DWI with PWI, is useful in predicting outcomes in patients with TCI. To date, DWI appears to be the imaging modality of choice in the evaluation of a TCI.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Helical computed tomography angiography</span> This type of angiography can rapidly and noninvasively image the large ce&#173;re&#173;bral arteries with very high specificity and sensitivity.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Carotid duplex ultrasonography</span> This imaging modality may be used to evaluate the &#173;patency of the extracranial carotid arteries.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Transcranial doppler ultrasonography</span> This type of ultrasonography is used for evaluation of the intracranial arteries (see more in the section Carotid Occlusive Disease).</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Ce&#173;re&#173;bral arteriography</span> Although it is the gold standard for angiographic technique, ce&#173;re&#173;bral arteriography has high morbidity and is usually required only if the cause of the TCI is unclear or if intra-&#173;arterial thrombolysis or surgical intervention is being strongly considered.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goals of treating ischemic stroke are to restore blood flow to the brain and to salvage ischemic brain tissue that has not already infarcted. Achieving &#173;these goals involves ensuring the patient’s medical stability and determining &#173;whether the patient is eligible for thrombolytic therapy. &#173;There is a narrow win&#173;dow in which to accomplish &#173;these objectives, ideally within 3 hours of symptom onset.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Intravenous thrombolysis</span> Thrombolytic and antithrombotic agents are the primary drugs used in the treatment of ischemic stroke, and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the fibrinolytic agent of choice. In the US National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) rtPA Stroke Study, the administration of rtPA within 3 hours of acute ischemic stroke was associated with improved function at 3 months but not with earlier neurologic improvement or lower mortality. The Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean Cooperative Acute Stroke Study III (ECASS III) demonstrated the benefit of rtPA initiated up to 4<span class="frac">½</span> hours &#173;after the onset of stroke. However, the exclusion criteria for patients treated 3–4<span class="frac">½</span> hours from symptom onset (age older than 80&#160;years, severe stroke, diabetes mellitus with a previous infarct, and any anticoagulant use) &#173;were more restrictive than for &#173;those treated at 3 hours or less. Most studies indicate that the sooner rtPA is initiated, the more likely it is to be beneficial. The most serious complication of administering rtPA is symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, which occurs in 6.4% of treated patients and has a mortality rate of 50%.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Mechanical (endovascular) thrombectomy</span> Unfortunately, patients with a large ce&#173;re&#173;bral artery occlusion and a large clot burden are less likely to benefit from rtPA and are at high risk of a neurologically disabling outcome. More proximal occlusions are also more resistant to thrombolysis, as are &#173;those occlusions resulting from clots with less favorable composition. Furthermore, &#173;because some patients fail to meet the eligibility criteria for intravenous rtPA, thrombectomy techniques &#173;were developed with clot-retrieving devices to improve canalization of the artery and arrest the ischemic stroke. Therefore, as part of the initial imaging evaluation of acute ischemic stroke, noninvasive vascular study, such as CT angiography, should be performed to assess the patient’s candidacy for endovascular intervention.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) performed with first-&#173;generation stent retrievers such as the Merci and Penumbra failed to show an improvement in patient outcomes. However, second-&#173;generation stent retrievers such as Solitaire and Trevo achieved significantly higher recanalization rates with correspondingly improved outcomes. Five clinical &#173;trials with second-&#173;generation stent retrieval devices (ESCAPE, EXTEND-&#173;IA, MR CLEAN, &#173;REVASCAT, and SWIFT PRIME) showed the efficacy of MT when compared with standard medical care in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by occlusion of the large arteries of the proximal anterior circulation. Anatomic success with recanalization, functional in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dence, and major neurologic recovery was significantly better in &#173;those patients receiving MT. However, mortality at 90 days, risk of intracranial hemorrhage, and risk of parenchymal hematoma involving greater than 30% of the infarct territory did not differ between the 2 study populations. &#173;These data have resulted in a paradigm shift in the early treatment of ischemic stroke; mechanical thrombectomy with second-&#173;generation stent retrieving devices is now highly recommended in eligible patients. Mechanical thrombectomy should be performed at centers with surgeons skilled in the use of stent-&#173;retrieving devices, and initiation of MT should be within 6 hours of stroke onset.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Investigational reperfusion techniques</span> Currently &#173;under investigation are other methods of reperfusion, such as intra-&#173;arterial thrombolysis (SYNTHESIS expansion trial), use of alternative fibrinolytic agents, combined intravenous and intra-&#173;arterial thrombolysis (IMS III trial), stenting, and combined use of fibrinolytics and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, but none of &#173;these techniques have yet demonstrated improved outcomes.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Post-&#173;acute management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cornerstone of stroke management is to prevent &#173;future events, especially &#173;because most stroke patients do not receive the acute care treatment previously discussed. In addition to thrombolytic drugs and mechanical thrombectomy, the management of stroke includes antithrombotic therapy with antiplatelet agents, initiation of statins, and control of BP &#173;after the acute phase is over.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Antithrombotic therapy</span> Although aspirin, clopidogrel, and aspirin/extended-&#173;release dipyridamole combination are acceptable drug choices for secondary stroke prevention, aspirin is the only antiplatelet agent that is effective in the early treatment of ischemic stroke. Two large clinical &#173;trials showed a benefit of treatment with aspirin over placebo in short-&#173;term mortality and recurrent stroke risk when aspirin is initiated within 48 hours of ischemic stroke onset. Early use of combination antiplatelet agents such as aspirin with clopidogrel for acute ischemic stroke may be beneficial, but the available evidence is not consistent and is limited to the specific populations studied. Heparin and related agents are not effective in reduction of mortality or recurrent stroke in patients with cardioembolic or noncardioembolic stroke; in fact, they are associated with higher mortality and a worse outcome. However, use of heparin may be considered in the acute care setting for stroke resulting from postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients with mechanical heart valves or in &#173;those with cervicocephalic arterial dissections.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Statins</span> Initiation or continuation of statins early &#173;after pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion is critically impor&#173;tant. Studies have shown that long-&#173;term intensive use of statins &#173;after stroke reduces risk of recurrent ischemic stroke and other cardiovascular events. In addition, numerous reports support the beneficial effects of statin administration during the acute phase of ischemic stroke.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Blood pressure control</span> Hypertension is the most impor&#173;tant risk &#173;factor for stroke. Treatment with antihypertensives in the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke is supported by data from multiple randomized clinical &#173;trials and from 2 meta-analyses of a total of 24 clinical &#173;trials with over 70,000 patients. Current guidelines from the 2014 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) recommend continued treatment with antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension prior to the stroke event and initiation of antihypertensive treatment for patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. Antihypertensive therapy is <span class="italic">not</span> recommended in patients with blood pressures lower than 120/70&#160;mm Hg as &#173;there may be risk of harm in individuals with systolic blood pressures lower than 120&#160;mm Hg. Although blood pressure reduction is critical in preventing recurrent ischemic stroke and other ischemic cardiovascular events, care must be taken to maintain blood pressure at a level that &#173;will not compromise ce&#173;re&#173;bral perfusion.</p>

			<p class="h1">Carotid Occlusive Disease</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Carotid atherosclerosis occurs most frequently in the proximal internal carotid artery (origin) and at the carotid bifurcation. The progression of luminal narrowing and ulceration leads to ischemic stroke or TCI from embolization, thrombosis, or hemodynamic compromise.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnostic Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This section describes the 4 main diagnostic techniques currently used to identify the degree of carotid stenosis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Carotid duplex ultrasonography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Carotid duplex ultrasonography is relatively inexpensive, quick, and noninvasive, with high sensitivity and high specificity for diagnosing high-&#173;grade carotid stenosis. However, ultrasonography may overestimate the degree of stenosis and is less accurate in individuals with less than 69% stenosis. The accuracy of the results is also very much operator-&#173;dependent, resulting in high variability among dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ultrasound laboratories. If the ultrasonography findings suggest the need for surgical intervention, it may be prudent to confirm with a second imaging modality.</p>
			<p class="h3">Magnetic resonance angiography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">MRA is more expensive than carotid ultrasonography and cannot be done in patients who are unable to assume a supine position or in &#173;those who have ferromagnetic implants and/or pacemakers. However, the 3-&#173;dimensional image of the carotid artery produced by MRA is useful in diagnosing high-&#173;grade carotid stenosis and provides an anatomic complement to carotid ultrasonography. The use of advanced MRI techniques is being studied to help physicians identify changes in plaque composition that may be useful for prognosticating risk of rupture and stroke.</p>
			<p class="h3">Computed tomography angiography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is superior to carotid ultrasonography for differentiating high-&#173;grade carotid stenosis from total occlusion and effectively excludes carotid stenosis that is greater than 70%, making CTA useful as a screening test. If &#173;there is disagreement between MRA and carotid ultrasonography results, CTA is useful in adjudicating the findings.</p>
			<p class="h3">Ce&#173;re&#173;bral angiography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ce&#173;re&#173;bral angiography remains the gold standard imaging modality for patients with suspected carotid occlusive disease, but its invasive nature and associated morbidity and mortality risk limits its applicability.</p>
			<p class="h3">Transcranial doppler ultrasonography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Transcranial doppler ultrasonography (TCD) is a useful adjunct to carotid ultrasonography &#173;because it gives physicians the ability to evaluate the flow characteristics of intrace&#173;re&#173;bral vessels. This ability enables the identification of high-&#173;grade internal carotid stenosis via the examination of the flow patterns of collateral vessels, including the reversal of ophthalmic artery flow.</p>
			<p class="h2">Management of Carotid Stenosis</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Asymptomatic carotid stenosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Asymptomatic carotid bruits</span> occur in 4% of the US population older than 40&#160;years, and the annual stroke rate in &#173;these individuals is 1.5%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This same population has an annual mortality rate of 4%, primarily from complications of heart disease. The presence of a carotid bruit is, therefore, a better predictor of arteriosclerotic disease than of stroke. As of 2014 the current AHA/ASA guidelines for management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">Patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis should be prescribed a statin and aspirin. They should also be screened for conditions that are risk &#173;factors for stroke, with appropriate institution of medical therapy and lifestyle modifications.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Individuals with greater than 50% stenosis should undergo serial annual ultra&#173;sonography to identify progression.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">It is reasonable to consider CEA in patients with greater than 70% stenosis if the perioperative complication risk for stroke, myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction, and death is less than 3%. However, the benefit of CEA over best medical therapy is controversial.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">For patients undergoing CEA, aspirin is recommended perioperatively and postoperatively, &#173;unless contraindicated.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Prophylactic carotid artery stenting (CAS) might be considered in select patients with stenosis that is greater than or equal to 60% on angiography or stenosis that is greater than or equal to 70% on ultrasonography, but the benefit of CAS over best medical therapy is not proven.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-11">In patients at high risk for complications related to revascularization that might result from &#173;either CEA or CAS, the effectiveness of revascularization versus medical therapy is not well established.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Con&#173;temporary intensive medical management (also called best medical therapy), which includes the more widespread and aggressive use of statins, newer antiplatelet agents, and lifestyle modifications (eg, cessation of smoking), as well as improvements in pharmacologic therapy for treatment of diabetes and hypertension, seems to have altered the prognosis in &#173;those assigned to medical therapy, which may now be equivalent or superior to outcomes from revascularization procedures. Furthermore, &#173;because most ischemic strokes due to carotid stenosis are preceded by a TCI, some experts feel that medical management should be the preferred treatment, and that physicians should wait &#173;until symptoms occur in the patient before subjecting a patient to the risks associated with revascularization. The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial-2 (CREST-2) study is now under way; it &#173;will compare outcomes in patients treated with best medical therapy versus &#173;those who undergo CEA.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Symptomatic carotid stenosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with TCI, transient monocular visual loss (TMVL), or previous stroke resulting from carotid stenosis are considered symptomatic. The risk of stroke within 1 year of onset of symptoms is 8% in patients with TCI; the risk thereafter is approximately 6% per year, with a 5-&#173;year risk of 35%–50%. Current AHA/ASA guidelines for management of symptomatic carotid stenosis are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">For patients with recent (within the past 6 months) TCI or ischemic stroke and severe (70%–99%) ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis, CEA is recommended if the perioperative morbidity and mortality risk is less than 6% and the patient’s life expectancy is greater than 5&#160;years.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">For patients with recent cerebrovascular events and moderate ipsilateral stenosis (50%–69%), CEA is recommended, depending on patient-&#173;specific &#173;factors such as age, sex, and other comorbidities.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;There is no benefit of CEA or CAS in a patient with stenosis of less than 50%.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Surgery may be performed within 2 weeks of a TCI or stroke.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">CAS can be considered as an alternative to CEA in symptomatic patients when the patient is at low risk for endovascular intervention <span class="italic">and</span> an internal carotid artery stenosis of greater than 70% is indicated by noninvasive imaging or an internal carotid artery stenosis of greater than 50% is indicated by catheter angiography. CAS may also be considered in other selected patients.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Carotid artery stenting versus carotid endarterectomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The first CREST study randomly assigned patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic carotid disease to CEA or CAS. The primary endpoint of the trial—&#173;a composite of any stroke, MI, or death within 30 days of the procedure and ipsilateral stroke during long-&#173;term follow-&#173;up—&#173;was similar in both groups, including the rate of ipsilateral stroke at <br />31 days to up to 4&#160;years &#173;after the procedure. The study showed that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-13">Endarterectomy had a greater benefit in older patients (<span class="symbol">≥</span>70&#160;years).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Stenting was more beneficial in patients in younger age groups (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>60&#160;years).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;There was a greater incidence of stroke and death at 30 days in the stenting group versus the endarterectomy group, but the incidence of MI was significantly lower in the CAS group.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">Despite the higher rate of stroke associated with stenting, at 1-&#173;year follow-up &#173;there &#173;were no significant differences in any quality-of-life mea&#173;sure between the CEA and CAS groups.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Transient monocular visual loss and cardioaortic &#173;causes of ischemic stroke</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition to ce&#173;re&#173;bral conditions, ocular conditions such as TMVL and ret&#173;i&#173;nal TCIs can be associated with carotid stenosis. The ophthalmologist is often the first physician to see a patient with TMVL; the TMVL is usually embolic, with &#173;either a carotid or a cardiac source. The annual stroke rate among patients with isolated TMVL, ret&#173;i&#173;nal infarcts, or TCIs is approximately 2%, 3%, and 8%, respectively. Untreated individuals with TMVL, ret&#173;i&#173;nal infarcts, or TCIs have a 30% risk of MI and an 18% risk of death over a 5-&#173;year period. A cardiac source of embolization should be excluded for all patients presenting with isolated TMVL. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can identify multiple potential cardiac &#173;causes for embolism and, as expected, the diagnostic yield is highest if the clinical history and physical examination suggest a cardiac source such as atrial fibrillation, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diffuse atherosclerosis, left ventricular aneurysm, or clinical endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is superior to transthoracic echocardiography in diagnosing a cardioembolic source, except for a left ventricular thrombus, which is better seen on TTE. &#173;Because TEE is invasive and uncomfortable and may not be tolerated well by the patient, TTE is recommended first in the evaluation of a potential cardioaortic source of stroke. If the results from TTE imaging are negative, the use of TEE would then be indicated. TEE is the best imaging modality to use to rule out atheromatous plaques in the ascending aorta, a patent foramen ovale, a left atrial appendage clot, or other &#173;causes of “cryptogenic” stroke. TEE is also superior for identifying certain anatomic abnormalities, but the identification of intracardiac thrombi or tumors with TEE is rare (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>3%). Therefore, &#173;whether the use of TEE &#173;will become routine in the evaluation of cryptogenic stroke remains to be seen. Other modalities used in the diagnosis of cardioembolic sources of stroke include inpatient telemetry, ambulatory Holter monitoring, loop recorders, and surgically implantable cardiac monitors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If evidence suggests that a carotid lesion is the cause of the TMVL, or if venous stasis retinopathy is pres&#173;ent, duplex ultrasonography should be performed to determine &#173;whether vessel wall disease or carotid stenosis is pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following approach should be considered for a patient presenting with a ce&#173;re&#173;bral or ret&#173;i&#173;nal transient ischemic attack (TIA):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">emergency department or urgent outpatient evaluation or hospital admission if the event occurred within the previous 48 hours</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">patient evaluation for the presence of risk &#173;factors associated with atherogenesis: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and smoking</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">institution of appropriate medical therapy</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">evaluation by appropriate testing for the presence of a cardiac source of emboli</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">determination using duplex ultrasonography of the possibility of carotid stenosis</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If ipsilateral carotid stenosis exceeds 70%, if bilateral carotid stenosis greater than 50% is pres&#173;ent, or if long-&#173;term evidence indicates progressive disease, CEA should be considered—&#173;but only if the surgeon’s perioperative stroke and death rate is less than 6%. Other&#173;wise, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin (325&#160;mg/day), aspirin/extended-&#173;release dipyridamole combination, or clopidogrel should be initiated. A patient presenting with TIA symptoms who has previously under&#173;gone CEA should be evaluated and treated similarly. Special attention should be paid to evaluating patients for the presence of early restenosis and thrombosis.</p>

			<p class="h1">Intracranial Hemorrhage</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the United States, intracranial hemorrhage constitutes approximately 13%–15% of acute cerebrovascular disorders. The most common &#173;causes of intracranial hemorrhage are bleeding from aneurysms of the arteries that compose the circle of Willis, bleeding from arterioles damaged by hypertension or arteriosclerosis, and trauma. Although intracranial hemorrhage has many &#173;causes, the anatomical location of the bleeding greatly influences the clinical picture. By location, hemorrhages can be broadly categorized as intrace&#173;re&#173;bral, intraventricular, or subarachnoid.</p>
			<p class="h2">Intrace&#173;re&#173;bral Hemorrhage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hypertension is the most common cause of nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Ce&#173;re&#173;bral amyloid angiopathy is the most common cause of nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage in el&#173;derly individuals, whereas AVMs are the most common cause in &#173;children. Infections resulting from septic emboli, hemorrhagic infarction, brain tumors, coagulopathies, and intrinsic vascular conditions such as moyamoya disease and vasculitis are all associated with intrace&#173;re&#173;bral bleeding.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The pathophysiology of intrace&#173;re&#173;bral bleeding secondary to hypertension appears to be intimal hyperplasia with hyalinosis that results in focal necrosis with pseudoaneurysm formation. When the vessel is exposed to high pressure that cannot be compensated for by the clotting cascade, small leaks lead to massive hemorrhage. Direct pressure to the brain parenchyma by the expanding clot and from cytotoxic perilesional edema results in direct tissue injury. As the clot expands, the ischemia increases and the cytotoxic edema develops further, raising intracranial pressure; if severe enough, this pressure may lead to herniation. Expansion of the hemorrhage into the intraventricular space occurs in 40%–60% of patients worldwide, greatly increasing morbidity and mortality.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to hypertension, a prospective study showed that age, high alcohol intake, African American race, and, oddly, low levels of low-&#173;density lipoprotein and triglycerides are associated with increased risk of intrace&#173;re&#173;bral hemorrhage. Most hypertensive hemorrhages occur during routine activity, but some may occur with exertion or intense emotional stress. Symptoms increase gradually over a few minutes to hours. Headache and vomiting occur in about 50% of cases. When intraventricular blood is involved, meningismus with stiff neck and nuchal rigidity occur.</p>
			<p class="h2">Intraventricular Hemorrhage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Worldwide, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) accounts for only 3% of intracranial bleeding. IVH typically occurs as a secondary phenomenon when an intrace&#173;re&#173;bral or subarachnoid hemorrhage extends into the ventricles. Thus, hypertension is also found in nearly half of individuals with IVH. Primary IVH is uncommon and is usually due to vascular malformations. Patients with IVH typically pres&#173;ent with abrupt onset headache, nausea, vomiting, and varying degrees of impaired consciousness. Focal neurologic findings are uncommon. The diagnostic test of choice for IVH is a noncontrast head CT. &#173;After the CT, MRI or MRA can be used to identify the anatomical cause of the hemorrhage. Treatment is aimed at cessation of the bleeding, reducing hydrocephalus, and managing raised intracranial pressure. Gradual lowering of blood pressure, placement of an intraventricular drain, and treating the specific cause (eg, repair of the aneurysm or obliteration of the AVM) should be undertaken.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for nearly 50% of cases of intracranial hemorrhage. Its incidence increases with age, and it is more common in &#173;women. African American and Hispanic individuals have a higher incidence of SAH when compared with white individuals. Most SAHs result from saccular, or “berry,” aneurysms. Only a minority of cases of SAH are nonaneurysmal in etiology. Approximately 85% of congenital saccular, or “berry,” aneurysms develop in the anterior part of the circle of Willis. The origin of the posterior communicating artery from the internal carotid artery is the most common site. Such an aneurysm typically pres&#173;ents with headache and third cranial nerve palsy involving the pupil. Vascular malformations within and on the surface of the brain parenchyma constitute approximately 7% of cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage and arise from capillary telangiectasias, cavernous hemangiomas, venous angiomas, or AVMs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Capillary telangiectasias and both types of angiomas typically have a low bleeding risk (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>0.5%/year). Findings that suggest an AVM as the cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage include a history of previous focal seizures, slow stepwise progression of focal neurologic signs, and, occasionally, recurrent unilateral throbbing headache resembling migraine. A bruit may be pres&#173;ent over the orbit or skull in approximately 40% of patients. SAH usually pre&#173;s&#173;ents with abrupt onset severe headache that is typically described by patients as the “worst headache of my life.” The headache occurs in 97% of cases; 30% have symptoms lateralized to the side of the hemorrhage. The combination of vitreous hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage <span class="italic">(Terson syndrome)</span> portends a worse prognosis. Maintaining a high index of suspicion and evaluating the patient with noncontrast CT, followed by mandatory lumbar puncture if CT results are negative, are essential in making the diagnosis. Digital subtraction angiography is superior to CT or MRA for the detection of SAH due to aneurysm.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Prognosis and treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Aneurysmal SAH carries a high mortality rate; 10% of individuals with an aneurysmal SAH die before they reach the hospital, 25% die within 24 hours, and 45% within 30 days. Prognostic &#173;factors include the patient’s level of consciousness and neurologic grade on hospital admission, the patient’s age, and the amount of blood hemorrhaged, as discovered via the initial head CT. Initial clinical severity may be assessed by a validated scale such as the Hunt and Hess scale &#173;because it is the most useful indicator of outcome &#173;after acute subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Control and maintenance of BP are mandatory in the treatment of ruptured aneurysms. Surgical intervention is ideally accomplished within 24–72 hours &#173;because the likelihood of early rebleeding is high and is associated with a poor outcome. The 2 traditional methods of interventional management are (1) placing a small clip or ligature (clipping) across the neck of the sac and (2) endovascular coiling. If an aneurysm is judged to be suitable for &#173;either technique, results of an analy&#173;sis of 3 randomized &#173;trials &#173;favor endovascular coiling over clipping in the surgical management of intracranial aneurysms. Patients with large intraparenchymal hematomas or &#173;middle ce&#173;re&#173;bral artery aneurysms may have better outcomes with clipping. Complete obliteration of the aneurysm is recommended, and patients who undergo &#173;either surgical intervention should undergo immediate angio&#173;graphy &#173;after the surgery to identify any remnants that may require retreatment. If the aneurysm cannot be directly obliterated, surgical ligation of a proximal vessel may be necessary. Complex aneurysms can also be treated with flow-&#173;diverting stents, which shunt blood flow from the aneurysmal vessel, thereby activating the coagulation cascade to stimulate gradual thrombosis of the aneurysm. Flow-&#173;diverting stents may result in a paradigm shift in treatment of aneurysms usually treated by traditional endovascular or microsurgical intervention, but long-&#173;term comparative data are not yet available.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The current gold standard of treatment is the surgical excision of a symptomatic AVM. Stereotactic radiosurgery and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy are valuable treatment options in patients with symptomatic AVMs deemed at a high risk for surgical excision; &#173;these methods are associated with low morbidity and mortality, with good occlusion rate. At pres&#173;ent, medical therapy is preferred over surgery in patients with unruptured AVMs.</p>
