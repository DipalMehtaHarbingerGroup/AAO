The fluid portion, <span class="italic">plasma,</span> is about 90% &#173;water. The remaining 10% of the plasma consists of proteins (albumin, globulin, fibrinogen, and enzymes), lipids, carbohydrates, hormones, &#173;vitamins, and salts.

			<p class="h1">Erythropoiesis</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All blood cells originate from the uncommitted pluripotent stem cells, which give rise to lymphoid stem cells and myeloid stem cells. <span class="italic">Myeloid stem cells</span> are the precursors of RBCs, granulocytes, monocytes, and platelets. Hormones such as erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-&#173;stimulating &#173;factor initiate the differentiation of the vari&#173;ous cellular ele&#173;ments. The life span of a circulating RBC is 120 days.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Anemia</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anemia is the result of an insufficient quantity of erythrocytes to carry oxygen to the peripheral tissues. It can be classified according to 3 pathophysiologic states: (1) blood loss or nutritional deficiency, (2) underproduction of erythrocytes, and (3) premature destruction of erythrocytes (hemolysis). The normal hemoglobin level in men ranges from 14 to 17&#160;g/dL, while the normal hemoglobin level in &#173;women is lower (12–16&#160;g/dL). The higher level in men is due to the erythropoietic effects of androgens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the evaluation of a patient with anemia, it is impor&#173;tant for the clinician to classify the disorder by reviewing the RBC indexes, including complete blood count, hemoglobin concentration, and erythrocyte count, as well as indexes specifically indicative of RBC size: the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of erythrocytes and their size distribution (red cell distribution width [RDW]). Reviewing &#173;these indexes and observing the morphology on a peripheral blood smear help the clinician determine &#173;whether the anemia is <span class="italic">microcytic</span> (MCV <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>80 femtoliter [fL]), <span class="italic">normocytic</span> (MCV 80–100 fL), or <span class="italic">macrocytic</span> (MCV <span class="symbol">&gt;</span>100 fL). In addition to the peripheral blood smear, the reticulocyte count gives an indication of erythrocyte production. Patients with normal bone marrow who have lost blood or under&#173;gone hemolysis have increased reticulocyte counts, whereas patients with underproduction anemia have low reticulocyte counts for their degree of anemia.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Anemia Due to Blood Loss or Nutritional Deficiency</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Iron deficiency anemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">By far, the most common type of anemia, affecting nearly 1 billion persons worldwide, is <span class="italic">iron deficiency anemia</span>. It is also the most common nutritional deficiency in the world. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed when the serum ferritin concentration is less than 15 µg/L or when transferrin saturation is less than 16%; the gold standard for diagnosis is the absence of stainable iron in the bone marrow.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In developing countries, iron deficiency is typically caused by poor intake and/or parasitic infections, whereas in high-&#173;income countries, chronic blood loss, vegetarian or vegan diet, and poor absorption are the more common &#173;causes. Absorption can be affected by inflammatory bowel disease, celiac sprue, and <span class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</span> infection. Bariatric surgery is an increasingly common cause of iron deficiency.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Iron deficiency anemia is also characterized by low hepcidin levels. <span class="italic">Hepcidin,</span> a peptide hormone produced by the liver, inhibits iron transport across the intestinal mucosa, thereby preventing excess iron absorption and maintaining normal iron levels within the body. Hepcidin also inhibits the transport of iron out of macrophages and enterocytes, that is, the site of iron storage and transport. &#173;Every adult with iron deficiency anemia should be suspected to be bleeding &#173;until proven other&#173;wise. Menstrual blood loss in &#173;women plays a major role, as does gastrointestinal bleeding in both men and &#173;women. Aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with mild iron deficiency anemia may experience fatigue, malaise, irritability, decreased exercise tolerance, restless legs syndrome, and headaches before symptoms of overt anemia occur. Patients with iron deficiency anemia typically have normal findings on physical examination. However, in severe cases, abnormal findings such as facial pallor, glossitis, stomatitis, koilonychia (spoon nails), and conjunctival pallor may be pres&#173;ent. Occasionally, patients with severe iron deficiency anemia exhibit pica, a tendency to eat ice, clay, starch, paper, or crunchy materials.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once the etiology of iron deficiency anemia has been identified, it may be treated with oral ferrous sulfate, which is the least expensive preparation for treating this disorder. It is typically administered at a dosage of 325&#160;mg 3 times daily, although recent data suggest that an alternate-&#173;day dosing regimen may yield greater absorption of iron due to its favorable effect on hepcidin levels, with fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects. Parenteral iron preparations are indicated for patients who are unable to absorb oral iron, are intolerant of its adverse effects, are on dialysis, or have iron deficiency due to blood loss from inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Vitamin B<span class="subscript-bold-h3 _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> deficiency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> comes from the diet and is available in all foods of animal origin. Absorption of vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> requires an intrinsic &#173;factor produced by the gastroparietal cells. This complex is absorbed in the terminal ileum and stored in the liver. It takes 3&#160;years to deplete the reserves of vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> in the liver. Strict vegetarians (vegans), patients with a history of abdominal surgery or gastrectomy/bariatric surgery, and individuals with parasitic (tapeworm) or pancreatic disease are at increased risk for vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> deficiency. <span class="italic">Pernicious anemia</span> is an autoimmune disease in which atrophic gastritis and subsequent intrinsic &#173;factor deficiency lead to impaired vitamin B<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">12</span> absorption. <span class="italic">Megaloblastic anemia</span> is a type of macrocytic anemia resulting from inhibition of DNA synthesis in RBC precursors in the marrow, leading to reduced cell division. When B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> levels are in the low normal range, the physician should examine levels of serum cobalamin B<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">12</span>, folate, homocysteine, and methyl&#173;malonic acid (a more sensitive and specific test for diagnosing vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> deficiency). Often, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia accompany the anemia. Even in the absence of hematologic changes, vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> deficiency can cause a neurologic syndrome; peripheral nerves are affected first, while balance prob&#173;lems and alteration of ce&#173;re&#173;bral function (eg, dementia, neuropsychiatric changes) occur in more severe cases. Parenteral B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> is used for treatment of pernicious anemia; other&#173;wise, daily oral B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> is effective, less expensive, and less cumbersome than parenteral B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span>.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Folate deficiency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Folate deficiency (also called folic acid deficiency) is another etiology of megaloblastic, or macrocytic, anemia. The most common etiology of the deficiency is inadequate dietary intake of folate due to generalized malnutrition or poor nutrition associated with alcohol dependence. Other &#173;causes of folate deficiency include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-8">malabsorption (celiac disease or tropical sprue, zinc deficiency)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">impaired metabolism (alcoholism, folate inhibitor drugs such as methotrexate and trimethoprim)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">increased requirements (hemolytic anemia, pregnancy, lactation, infection, malignancy)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-9">increased excretion (dialysis, subsequent to vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> deficiency)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is impor&#173;tant to exclude vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> deficiency in patients with presumed folate deficiency; although treatment with folic acid can correct anemia in patients with vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> deficiency, it does not reverse the neuropsychiatric symptoms that can occur in severe B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> deficiency. Patients with folate deficiency may also develop neuropsychiatric symptoms that overlap with vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> deficiency. Once vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> deficiency is excluded, a therapeutic trial of folic acid in patients with presumed folate deficiency may be the most cost-&#173;effective way of establishing the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Anemia Due to Defective Hemoglobin Synthesis (Hemoglobinopathies)</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Thalassemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The thalassemias are a group of hereditary anemias characterized by a reduced rate of synthesis of hemoglobin polypeptide chains alpha or beta. This decreased synthesis leads, in turn, to reduced hemoglobin and a hypochromic microcytic anemia. <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-&#173;<span class="italic">Thalassemia</span> is due to a gene deletion that reduces synthesis of alpha hemoglobin chains. Homozygous <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-&#173;thalassemia leads to hydrops fetalis, which usually results in intrauterine or perinatal death. <span class="greek-tx-italic">b</span><span class="italic">-&#173;Thalassemia</span> is caused by a point mutation rather than a deletion. In the absence of beta chains, the excess of alpha chains leads to instability in the RBC and hemolysis. The bone marrow becomes hyperplastic, which may lead to bone deformities and fractures in severe cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Management includes transfusion and iron chelation to minimize iron overload. Advances in transfusion and institution of regular chelation therapy with better-&#173;tolerated iron-&#173;chelating agents—as well as earlier recognition and treatment of iron-&#173;induced organ injury—&#173;have markedly improved survival rates. <span class="italic">Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)</span> is the only cure available for thalassemia. At pres&#173;ent, &#173;there are no randomized &#173;trials comparing HCT with medical therapy, and refinements in treatment have improved both modalities. Prognostic &#173;factors associated with a good outcome for HCT are young age of patient, availability of an HLA-&#173;identical sibling donor without thalassemia, and matched sibling bone marrow—or umbilical cord blood–&#173;derived transplant stem cells. The prognosis for HCT is also correlated with the severity and duration of iron overload. Thus, the importance of iron chelation performed on a regular basis cannot be overemphasized. The likelihood of cure in optimal patients exceeds 90%, with a 4% risk of transplant-&#173;related mortality. Splenectomy is an option for some patients with hypersplenism and splenic complications such as splenic infarction or splenic vein thrombosis and may reduce the need for transfusions. The effect of splenectomy, however, may be transient, and its benefits must be weighed against the risk of infection &#173;after the procedure.</p>

			<p class="h3">Sickle cell disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">S<span class="italic">ickle cell disease (SCD),</span> or <span class="italic">sickle cell anemia</span>, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by an amino acid substitution on the beta chain, which produces an abnormal form of hemoglobin (<span class="italic">hemoglobin S</span>) that leads, in turn, to chronic hemolytic anemia. Hemoglobin S, which appears several months &#173;after birth, damages the RBC membrane, resulting in malformed sickle-&#173;shaped cells. &#173;Couples at risk of having a child with SCD can be tested for sickle cell trait, and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counseling should be made available to them. SCD is on the list for disorders that newborns are screened for at time of birth. One out of 400 black persons born in the United States, 1 out of 250 black persons born in the West Indies, and 1 out of 4000 born in France have SCD. Chronic hemolytic anemia can result in jaundice, gallstones, poorly healing ulcers over the lower tibia, and splenomegaly (which dis&#173;appears &#173;after a few years &#173;because of repeated splenic infarction).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to causing hemolytic anemia, SCD has systemic, multiorgan manifestations. It is characterized by acute, painful episodes caused by the sickling of the RBCs (<span class="italic">vaso-&#173;occlusive crisis</span>); &#173;these episodes can be precipitated by infection, dehydration, and/or hypoxia. Vascular occlusion can lead to necrosis of bone and to infection. Hematuria can be caused by infarction of the renal papillae. Sickle cell retinopathy can lead to vision loss in severe cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With improved supportive care, an affected person now has an average life expectancy into the 50s or 60s. Diagnosis is made with a screening test for sickle cell hemoglobin and confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis. SCD requires lifelong routine medical care, which includes regular updating of vaccinations; annual ophthalmologic examinations; and screening for hypertension, proteinuria, and pulmonary hypertension. Patients should be given folic acid supplements and, if infections arise, specific antibiotic treatment. Routine oxygen is no longer used in uncomplicated crises and without pulmonary symptoms. <span class="italic">Hydroxyurea</span>, the only disease-&#173;modifying drug in SCD, has resulted in decreased mortality. <span class="italic">Crizanlizumab,</span> a novel, investigational monoclonal antibody against &#173;P-&#173;selectin adhesion molecule, has been shown to reduce episodes of painful vaso-&#173;occlusive crisis. Clinical &#173;trials are currently &#173;under way.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hematopoietic cell transplantation from an HLA-&#173;identical sibling is a potentially curative option in the treatment of sickle cell disease. When and for whom HCT should be pursued is controversial. Current data from the Center for International Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Research and from Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean Blood and Marrow Transplant registries show an overall survival of 91% and 95%, respectively, &#173;after HCT, as well as improved quality of life. However, the pos&#173;si&#173;ble consequences of HCT must also be considered, including the risk of mortality, debilitating chronic graft-&#173;vs-&#173;host disease, and infertility. If an HLA-&#173;matched sibling donor is available, HCT is recommended for individuals &#173;under 17&#160;years of age with severe symptoms of sickle cell disease that are unresponsive to transfusions and hydroxyurea.</p>

			<p class="h2">Anemia Due to Destruction of Red Blood Cells</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Hemolytic anemia</span> is defined as a condition in which the life span of RBCs is shortened by premature destruction. In response to hemolysis, the kidneys increase synthesis of erythropoietin, stimulating production of RBC precursors and a subsequent rise in reticulocyte count. Peripheral blood smear evaluation may show a pattern of red cell destruction (evidenced by schistocytes or helmet cells) that reveals a potentially life-&#173;threatening disease pro&#173;cess such as thrombotic microangiopathy associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or hemolytic-&#173;uremic syndrome (HUS).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The &#173;causes of hemolytic anemia are numerous and include acquired conditions as well as ge&#173;ne&#173;tic conditions. Hemolytic anemia may be severe and life-&#173;threatening or mild and chronic. Given the numerous etiologies, it is useful to conceptualize the mechanisms of hemolysis as being &#173;either <span class="italic">intracorpuscular</span> (intrinsic defects of the red blood cell that lead to premature destruction) or <span class="italic">extracorpuscular</span> (in which the red blood cell is rendered susceptible to lysis by extrinsic &#173;factors).</p>
			<p class="h3">Intracorpuscular defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intracorpuscular defects may be caused by hemoglobinopathies, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic membrane or cytoskeletal defects, acquired membrane disorders, or intrinsic metabolic abnormalities, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Hereditary membrane disorders.</span> Hereditary spherocytosis is the most common type.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Acquired membrane disorders.</span> Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) manifests clinically with intravascular hemolysis, nocturnal pink or red urine, and a variable degree of jaundice and fatigue. Diagnosis of PNH is made by flow cyto&#173;metry, which may incorporate fluo&#173;rescent aerolysin (FLAER) assay.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3"><span class="italic">Metabolic disorders.</span> Glucose-6-&#173;phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (X-&#173;linked inheritance) and pyruvate kinase deficiency increase the susceptibility of red blood cells to oxidative stress and damage.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3">Extracorpuscular &#173;causes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Antibody-&#173;mediated destruction</span> leading to anemia (<span class="italic">Coombs-&#173;positive hemolytic anemia</span>) is caused by autoantibodies directed at RBC surface antigens. The condition may be assessed by direct antiglobulin testing (direct Coombs testing) for the presence of anti-&#173;IgG or anti-&#173;C3d. Other &#173;causes of antibody-&#173;mediated destruction include drug-&#173;induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), lymphoproliferative disorders, and transfusion-&#173;related hemolysis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other extracorpuscular &#173;factors leading to accelerated RBC destruction include hyper&#173;splenism with increased trapping; red blood cell pathogens like malaria, babesiosis, bartonellosis, and clostridial sepsis; mechanical heart valves; platelet microthrombi, as in TTP or HUS; or fibrin strands in blood vessels that shear the RBCs, as in disseminated intravascular coagulation. In addition, exposure to drugs that cause nonimmune (oxidative stress) destruction; trauma; and, less commonly, toxins such as snake venom, insect bites, and copper poisoning in Wilson disease are extrinsic &#173;causes of hemolytic anemia.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Evaluation and management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hemolytic anemia may be suspected in a patient who has rapid-&#173;onset anemia in the absence of blood loss, dark urine, and jaundice, along with laboratory confirmation of hemolysis. A systematic approach to identifying the specific cause of hemolysis includes obtaining a detailed history that may, for example, reveal a recent transfusion, initiation of a new drug, or a &#173;family history of a hemoglobinopathy or other ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorder. Examination of the peripheral smear and flow cytometry may provide the diagnosis. Treatment of hemolytic anemia depends upon the under&#173;lying etiology, but regardless of cause, folic acid supplementation is necessary.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Anemia Due to Inflammation and Chronic Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Inflammatory anemia can occur in chronic conditions such as chronic infections (eg, tuberculosis, osteomyelitis), malignancies, collagen-&#173;vascular diseases, and liver disease. Chronic renal failure can also cause a more severe type of anemia, primarily due to the decrease in erythropoietin production.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Anemia Due to Bone Marrow Disorders</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Aplastic anemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Aplastic anemia refers to anemia with pancytopenia associated with varying degrees of bone marrow hypoplasia/aplasia. The &#173;causes are diverse, and the condition has a very high mortality if left untreated. The loss of hematopoietic stem cells in aplastic anemia may be caused by direct toxic injury by drugs, chemicals, ionizing radiation, autoimmune pro&#173;cesses, or infectious agents, as well as by clonal and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic abnormalities. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other conditions that cause pancytopenia such as megaloblastic anemia and bone marrow infiltration.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Sideroblastic anemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If the incorporation of iron into the heme molecule is defective, hemoglobin synthesis is reduced; this condition is called <span class="italic">sideroblastic anemia (SA).</span> Diagnosis of SA is made primarily on the basis of bone marrow examination with Prus&#173;sian blue stain. A normal sideroblast is an erythroblast with few granules of hemosiderin in the cytoplasm; but in SA, iron accumulation, particularly in the mitochondria, leads to development of the “ring sideroblast.” Sideroblastic anemia may be caused by a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorder, or it may develop indirectly as part of a myelodysplastic syndrome (refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts) that can pro&#173;gress to acute myelogenous leukemia or other hematologic malignancies. Other &#173;causes of SA are usually acquired and include chronic alcoholism and lead poisoning.</p>

			<p class="h1">Disorders of Hemostasis</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Disorders of hemostasis may be due to defects in platelet number or function or to prob&#173;lems in formation of a fibrin clot (coagulation). A basic understanding of the hemostatic pro&#173;cess and the manifestations associated with specific abnormalities helps the ophthalmologist with both medical and surgical management. (See <span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-1</span> for a diagram of blood-&#173;clotting pathways.) For the purpose of laboratory test interpretation, the coagulation cascade can be divided into <span class="italic">intrinsic</span> and <span class="italic">extrinsic</span> pathways. However, it is now understood that this is an oversimplification. For example, &#173;factor IX (an intrinsic &#173;factor) can be activated by &#173;factor VII (an extrinsic &#173;factor).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Hemostasis</span> is initiated by damage to a blood vessel wall. This event triggers constriction of the vessel, followed by accumulation and adherence of platelets at the site of injury. Coagulation &#173;factors in the blood are activated, leading to formation of a fibrin clot. Slow fibrinolysis ensues, dissolving the clot while the damage is repaired. Circulating inhibitors are also pres&#173;ent, modulating the pro&#173;cess by inactivating coagulation &#173;factors to prevent widespread clotting. Normal endothelium plays a critical role in naturally anticoagulating blood by preventing fibrin accumulation. The following physiologic antithrombotic components can produce this effect:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">antithrombin</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">protein C and/or protein S</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">tissue &#173;factor pathway inhibitor</li>

Activated protein C (APC), with its cofactor protein S, functions as a natu&#173;ral anticoagulant by destroying &#173;factors Va and VIIa. Thrombin itself activates protein C. Although inherited deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S are associated with a lifelong thrombotic tendency, tissue &#173;factor pathway inhibitor deficiency has not yet been related to the hypercoagulable state (see the section “Thrombotic disorders” &#173;later in this chapter).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-15">Laboratory Evaluation of Hemostasis and Blood Coagulation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vari&#173;ous techniques are used to assess the status of a patient’s hemostatic mechanisms. &#173;Following are some of the most common tests:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-8"><span class="italic">Platelet count.</span> Minor bleeding may occur at platelet counts below 50,000/µL. &#173;Abnormal bleeding at higher platelet counts suggests abnormal platelet function. Below 20,000/µL, spontaneous bleeding may be serious.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Tests of platelet function.</span><ul><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="italic">Bleeding time.</span> This was the first test of in vivo platelet function. However, &#173;because it is operator-&#173;dependent, insensitive, time-&#173;consuming, and poorly reproducible, it &#173;will likely be phased out.</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="italic">Platelet function analyzer</span>. This rapid and &#173;simple test mea&#173;sures the ability of activated platelets in a high-&#173;shear environment to occlude an aperture; it replaces in vivo bleeding time.</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="italic">Platelet aggregometry.</span> Vari&#173;ous techniques include impedance &#173;whole blood, light transmission, and the VerifyNow assay. Light transmission aggregometry is the current gold standard test for mea&#173;sur&#173;ing platelet function and inhibition.</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="italic">Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).</span> The aPTT test incorporates &#173;factors I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII; prekallikrein; and high-&#173;molecular-&#173;weight kinin&#173;ogen. The aPTT test is most commonly used to mea&#173;sure the effect of heparin therapy. Platelet abnormalities do not affect the result of this test.</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list ParaOverride-16"><span class="italic">Prothrombin time (PT).</span> The PT test mea&#173;sures the integrity of &#173;factors I, II, V, VII, and X. It requires a 30% concentration of the vitamin K–&#173;dependent &#173;factors II, VII, and X (but not &#173;factor IX, a part of the intrinsic pathway) and therefore is prolonged in conditions affecting &#173;these &#173;factors (see Disorders of Blood Coagulation &#173;later in this chapter). The PT test is most commonly used to monitor anticoagulant therapy. The action of heparin may slightly prolong PT.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Efforts have been made to tailor anticoagulation therapy to the prob&#173;lem being treated. For example, treatment or prevention of deep venous thrombosis is thought to require less oral anticoagulation therapy than treatment of endocardial mural thrombi or cardiac replacement valves. However, &#173;because of variation in test results among and within laboratories, the international normalized ratio (INR) was developed. The INR modifies the standard PT ratio (patient PT to control PT) to reflect the par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar thromboplastin reagent used by a laboratory. The resulting reported INR value is an expression of the ratio of the patient’s PT to the laboratory’s mean normal PT. Thus, for prevention or treatment of deep venous thrombosis, the recommended INR value (comparable to subsequent values mea&#173;sured over time or across laboratories) is 2.0–3.0; for tissue replacement valves, 2.0–3.0; and for mechanical replacement valves, 2.5–3.5.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Genetic testing in the form of a DNA assay is also available to determine the correct warfarin dose for an individual patient, especially in cases in which re&#173;sis&#173;tance to the drug is suspected. This knowledge has substantially reduced the risk of bleeding and clotting events.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Clinical Manifestations of Hemostatic Abnormalities</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hemorrhage resulting from hemostatic derangement must be differentiated from hemorrhage caused by localized pro&#173;cesses. The presence of generalized or recurrent bleeding suggests abnormal hemostasis. <span class="italic">Petechiae</span> (small capillary hemorrhages of the skin and mucous membranes) and <span class="italic">purpura</span> (ecchymoses) are typical of platelet disorders and vasculitis. Subcutaneous hematomas and hemarthroses characterize coagulation abnormalities. Bleeding due to trauma may be massive and life-&#173;threatening in coagulation disorders, whereas bleeding is more likely to be slow and prolonged when platelet function is impaired.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Vascular Disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A number of inherited and acquired disorders of blood vessels and their supporting connective tissues result in pathologic bleeding. <span class="italic">Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia</span> (Rendu-&#173;Osler-&#173;Weber disease) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by localized dilation of capillaries and venulae of the skin and mucous membranes. The lesions increase in size and number over a period of de&#173;cades, often leading to profuse bleeding.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several inherited vascular disorders are associated with hemorrhage. <span class="italic">Ehlers-&#173;Danlos syndrome</span> is characterized by hyperplastic fragile skin and hyperextensible joints; it is dominantly inherited. In <span class="italic">osteogenesis imperfecta,</span> also a dominant disorder, bone fractures and otosclerosis (leading to deafness) are common. In both conditions, easy bruising and hematomas are common. <span class="italic">Pseudoxanthoma elasticum,</span> a recessive disorder, is much rarer but is often complicated by gastrointestinal hemorrhage. <span class="italic">Marfan syndrome</span> is sometimes associated with mild bleeding as well as with aortic dissection.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Scurvy,</span> the result of severe ascorbic acid deficiency, is associated with marked vascular fragility and hemorrhagic manifestations resulting from abnormal synthesis of collagen. In addition to the classic findings of perifollicular petechiae and gingival bleeding, intradermal, intramuscular, and subperiosteal hemorrhages are common. <span class="italic">Amyloidosis</span> is another acquired disorder in which petechiae and purpura are common.</p>

Conjunctival lesions occur in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Blue sclerae are typical of osteogenesis imperfecta. Ocular manifestations of Ehlers-&#173;Danlos syndrome include microcornea, myopia, and angioid streaks; ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment and ectopia lentis have also been reported. Angioid streaks also occur in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Fifty &#173;percent of patients with Marfan syndrome have ectopia lentis; severe myopia and ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment are common.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Platelet Disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">By far the most common cause of abnormal bleeding, platelet disorders may result from an insufficient number of platelets, inadequate functioning, or both. Mild derangement of platelet function may be asymptomatic or may cause minor bruising, menorrhagia, or bleeding &#173;after surgery. More severe dysfunction leads to petechiae, purpura, and gastro&#173;intestinal bleeding and other types of serious bleeding.</p>
			<p class="h3">Thrombocytopenia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The number of platelets may be reduced by decreased production, increased destruction, or abnormal distribution. Production may be suppressed by many &#173;factors, including radiation, drugs, chemotherapy, alcohol use, malignant invasion of the bone marrow, aplastic anemia, and vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> or folic acid deficiency.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-18"><span class="h4-head">Thrombocytopenia due to immune destruction</span> <span class="italic">Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)</span> is the result of platelet injury by antiplatelet antibodies. The International Working Group on ITP classifies it into 3 categories: primary ITP; secondary ITP associated with other conditions such as SLE, HIV infection, malignancy, and hepatitis C; and drug-&#173;induced thrombocytopenia. The acute form of ITP usually occurs in &#173;children and young adults, often following a viral illness, and commonly undergoes spontaneous remission. Chronic ITP is more common in adults and is characterized by mild manifestations; spontaneous remission is uncommon. Initial treatment consists of corticosteroid therapy. Patients with ITP who do not respond to corticosteroid therapy, who are bleeding and require rapid increase in platelet count, or who require surgical intervention should receive intravenous immunoglobulin. Alternatively, anti-&#173;D immunoglobulin may be administered in &#173;those who are Rh positive. Rituximab or splenectomy is recommended for ITP refractory to corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin. &#173;Because spontaneous remission may occur, clinicians often delay splenectomy for at least 6 months. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-&#173;RAs) such as romiplostim or eltrombopag or immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate mofetil may also be of benefit. Fostamatinib has also recently received FDA approval for treatment of chronic ITP. Splenectomy, however, has been reported to provide the highest durable remission rate and, in balance, still appears to be the favored second-&#173;line treatment over rituximab and TPO-&#173;RAs, except in poor surgical candidates or &#173;those who prefer a nonsurgical approach.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A neonatal form of the disorder occurs in babies born to &#173;women with ITP; this form results from transplacental passage of antiplatelet antibodies. Recovery follows physiologic clearance of the antibodies from the child’s circulation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many drugs and other substances, including quinine, quinidine, digitalis, procainamide, thiazide-&#173;type diuretics, sulfonamides, phenytoin, aspirin, penicillin, heparin, and gold compounds, have been implicated as &#173;causes of immunologic platelet destruction. Drug-&#173;induced thrombocytopenia is common, and discontinuation of the offending drug should result in platelet recovery.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="h4-head">Nonimmunologic thrombocytopenia</span> Types of nonimmunologic thrombocytopenia include <span class="italic">thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic-&#173;uremic syndrome (HUS),</span> and the syndromes of <span class="italic">disseminated intravascular coagulation</span> (see the section “Disseminated intravascular coagulation” &#173;later in the chapter). TTP is caused by an inherited or acquired deficiency of the von Willebrand &#173;factor–&#173;cleaving protease ADAMTS13. It is characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy and hemolytic anemia. Fever, neurologic symptoms, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction occur, often with subacute onset. Death occurs in days to weeks in the majority of untreated cases. However, early treatment with exchange plasmapheresis has improved the survival rate to over 80%, especially when rituximab is given as part of initial therapy. Despite significant thrombocytopenia, bleeding is relatively uncommon. Therefore, platelet transfusions are usually unnecessary &#173;because plasma exchange abates the consumption pro&#173;cess. However, platelet transfusion may be indicated in patients with severe bleeding or in &#173;those who &#173;will undergo an invasive procedure. Refractory cases may be treated with antiplatelet drugs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents. Eculizumab is recommended in complement-&#173;mediated TTP.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Hemolytic-&#173;uremic syndrome</span> is similar in pathophysiology to TTP in that both are associated with MAHA, thrombocytopenia, and renal involvement. The most common cause of HUS, especially among &#173;children, is Shiga toxin–&#173;producing <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> (STEC), which accounts for 90% of cases of HUS<span class="italic">.</span> TTP and HUS are similar in clinical appearance, and laboratory confirmation of low ADAMTS13 activity (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>10% in patients with TTP) may take several days; &#173;these &#173;factors complicate the decision &#173;whether to initiate plasma exchange or anticomplement therapy emergently. The abnormal distribution of platelets is most commonly caused by splenic sequestration. The usual clinical setting is hepatic cirrhosis, and the level of thrombocytopenia is mild. Patients with severely depressed platelet counts prob&#173;ably also have accelerated platelet destruction in the spleen.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-19">Thrombocytosis and essential thrombocythemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Thrombocytosis</span> is defined as a platelet count exceeding 450,000. <span class="italic">Essential thrombocythe</span><span class="italic">mia (ET)</span> refers to an excess of platelets due to a primary bone marrow clonal disorder. <span class="italic">Reactive thrombocytosis</span> is secondary to other conditions such as inflammatory disorders. Management of reactive thrombocytosis is aimed at treating the under&#173;lying cause such as infection, inflammation (eg, &#173;giant cell arteritis), trauma, iron deficiency, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and pancreatitis. In contrast, ET is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder akin to neoplastic disease. Severe autonomous increase in platelet counts may also be caused by other myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Epidemiologic studies have determined a prevalence rate of ET of 30/100,000&#160;in the general population worldwide with a nearly 2:1 ratio between men and &#173;women. Regardless of etiology, severe thrombocytosis can cause both thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. However, thrombohemorrhagic complications are much more common in ET and in other clonal myeloproliferative disorders and include arterial and venous thromboses, cerebrovascular accident, myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction, and deep venous thrombosis. Hemorrhagic events include ecchymoses, subcutaneous hematomas, epistaxis, and gum bleeding. About 36% of patients, however, are asymptomatic. &#173;There is a 2%–5% long-&#173;term risk of leukemic transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. Treatment is centered on inhibition of platelet aggregation, especially in patients at high risk of thrombotic events, as well as cytoreduction. Aspirin and other antiplatelet agents such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel inhibit aggregation. Hydroxyurea and interferon alfa reduce platelet counts by bone marrow inhibition. Anagrelide, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has both platelet antiaggregating and cytoreductive properties.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Platelet dysfunction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with platelet dysfunction usually come to the physician’s attention &#173;because of easy bruising, epistaxis, menorrhagia, or excessive bleeding &#173;after surgery or dental work. Unlike patients with marked thrombocytopenia, patients with platelet dysfunction rarely have petechiae.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hereditary disorders of platelet function are rare. Much more impor&#173;tant clinically are the acquired forms, of which drug ingestion is the most common cause. As with drugs causing antiplatelet antibodies, the list of causative agents is very long. A single aspirin tablet taken orally irreversibly inhibits platelet aggregation for the life span of the circulating platelets pres&#173;ent, causing a modest prolongation of bleeding time for at least 48–72 hours following ingestion. This reaction has remarkably &#173;little effect in other&#173;wise healthy individuals, although intraoperative blood loss may be slightly increased. However, bleeding may be significant in patients with hemophilia, severe thrombocytopenia, or uremia and in &#173;those on warfarin or heparin therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs cause reversible inhibition of platelet function in the presence of the drug; the effect dis&#173;appears as the drug is cleared from the blood. Other commonly used drugs that may affect platelet function include ethanol, tricyclic antidepressants, and antihistamines.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to uremia, clinical conditions associated with abnormal platelet function include liver disease, multiple myeloma, SLE, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Hermansky-&#173;Pudlak syndrome (an autosomal recessive form of oculocutaneous albinism).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-21">Disorders of Blood Coagulation</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Hereditary coagulation disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Inherited coagulation abnormalities involve all of the coagulation &#173;factors except &#173;factors III and IV. The most common and most severe of &#173;these abnormalities is &#173;factor VIII deficiency, called <span class="italic">hemophilia A,</span> or <span class="italic">classical hemophilia.</span> &#173;Factor IX deficiency is called <span class="italic">hemophilia B.</span> Both types are X-&#173;linked. Typical manifestations of hemophilia A include severe and protracted bleeding, &#173;after even minor trauma, and spontaneous bleeding into joints (hemarthroses), the central ner&#173;vous system, and the abdominal cavity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of hemophilia A involves infusion of &#173;factor VIII. With the availability of recombinant &#173;factor VIII, the risk of transmission of hepatitis B and C and HIV has now been mostly eliminated. However, about 5%–10% of patients with hemophilia A develop inhibiting antibodies, presumably due to sensitization following administration of &#173;factor VIII. &#173;These inhibitors bind to the infused &#173;factor VIII and render it in&#173;effec&#173;tive; subsequently, the patient &#173;will need bypassing agents such as recombinant &#173;factor VIIa or an anti-&#173;inhibitor coagulant complex. Antibodies inhibiting coagulation can also develop in healthy older patients, in nonhemophilic patients &#173;after drug reactions, and in &#173;those with inherited vascular disorders. Clinical manifestations range from mild bleeding to full-&#173;blown hemophilia that correlates with level of &#173;factor deficiency. The aPTT is prolonged, while the PT is normal. Treatment involves vari&#173;ous regimens of coagulation &#173;factor replacement and immuno&#173;suppression in an attempt to eliminate the inhibitor. However, during episodes of bleeding or as prophylaxis before surgery, patients with high titers of inhibitor should receive recombinant &#173;factor VIIa or an anti-&#173;inhibitor coagulant complex as first-&#173;line therapy. <span class="italic">Emicizumab,</span> a monoclonal antibody that binds &#173;factor IXa and supplants the need for &#173;factor VIIIa as&#160;a cofactor for &#173;factor X activation, was recently approved by the FDA. An investigational monoclonal antibody, <span class="italic">concizumab</span>, which inhibits the tissue &#173;factor pathway, is now in clinical &#173;trials. Gene therapy is currently in the developmental phase but could further transform the outlook for &#173;these patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Von Willebrand disease (vWD)</span> is the most common inherited bleeding disorder: low levels of von Willebrand &#173;factor (vWF) are found in 1% of the population. The 2 main functions of vWF are stabilizing &#173;factor VIII to prevent degradation and promoting platelet adhesion. &#173;There are 3 major types of vWD. <span class="italic">Type 1</span> is autosomal dominant and accounts for 75% of cases. <span class="italic">Type 2</span> (15%–20% of cases) has 4 subtypes and is predominantly autosomal dominant, and <span class="italic">type 3</span> (5%) is autosomal recessive. Type 1 manifests with mild mucocutaneous bleeding, and most forms of type 2 are associated with mild to moderate bleeding. In contrast, the recessively inherited forms are associated with very low levels of &#173;factor VIII and severe bleeding. A form of vWD also occurs in patients with aortic valve stenosis and in some patients with thrombocythemia. Desmopressin, a synthetic form of vasopressin (anti&#173;diuretic hormone), may be used for episodes of bleeding and administered preoperatively to reduce risk of surgical bleeding. Plasma-&#173;derived concentrates to replace vWF are available for patients who cannot tolerate desmopressin or need prolonged treatment.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Vitamin K deficiency</span> Vitamin K is required for the production of &#173;factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X in the liver. Normal diets contain large amounts of vitamin K, which is also synthesized by intestinal flora. &#173;Causes of vitamin K deficiency include biliary obstruction and vari&#173;ous malabsorption syndromes (including sprue, cystic fibrosis, and celiac disease), in which intestinal absorption of vitamin K is reduced. Suppression of endogenous gastrointestinal flora, seen commonly in hospitalized patients on prolonged broad-&#173;spectrum antibiotic therapy, decreases intestinal production of vitamin K. However, clinical deficiency occurs only if dietary intake is also diminished. Nutritional deficiency is unusual but may occur with prolonged parenteral nutrition. Laboratory evaluation reveals prolongation of both PT and, &#173;later in the course of the disease, aPTT. Most forms of vitamin K deficiency respond to subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of 20&#160;mg of vitamin K<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">1</span>; coagulation defects normalize within 24 hours. Vitamin K<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">1</span> should not be given intravenously &#173;because of the risk of sudden death from an anaphylactoid reaction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">One special form of vitamin K deficiency is <span class="italic">hemorrhagic disease of the newborn,</span> which is the result of a normal mild deficiency of vitamin K–&#173;dependent &#173;factors during the first 5 days of life and the absence of the vitamin in maternal milk. This condition is now rare in developed countries &#173;because of the routine administration of vitamin K to newborns. (See also the section Antiphospholipid Syndrome in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;9.</span>)</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Liver disease</span> Hemostatic abnormalities of all types may be associated with disease of the liver, the site of production of all the coagulation &#173;factors except &#173;factor VIII and &#173;factor XIII A-&#173;subunit. As liver dysfunction develops, levels of the vitamin K–&#173;dependent &#173;factors decrease first, followed by &#173;those of &#173;factors V, XI, and XII; both PT and aPTT are prolonged. Thrombocytopenia, primarily the result of hypersplenism, and a prolonged bleeding time due to platelet dysfunction are common. In addition, intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis are often pres&#173;ent, further complicating the clinical picture.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Mild hemorrhagic symptoms are common in patients with significant liver disease. Severe bleeding is usually gastrointestinal in origin, arising from peptic ulcers, gastritis, or esophageal varices. Treatment is difficult at best and consists of blood and coagulation &#173;factor replacement. Local mea&#173;sures, such as vasopressin infusion or balloon tamponade of bleeding varices, can sometimes control potentially catastrophic bleeding.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Disseminated intravascular coagulation</span> <span class="italic">Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)</span> is a complex syndrome involving widespread activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems within the general circulation. The syndrome is a secondary pro&#173;cess, triggered by exposure of procoagulants to the bloodstream, which activates the coagulation cascade, resulting in formation of fibrin and fibrin degradation products (fibrin split products), resulting in occlusion of the microcirculation as well as vari&#173;ous forms of organ failure and, occasionally, thrombosis of larger vessels. Subsequently, utilization and consumption of the coagulation &#173;factors and platelets produce bleeding. Laboratory findings may vary but usually include thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and elevated levels of fibrin split products. PT and aPTT are usually, but not invariably, prolonged.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinically, 2 forms of DIC are recognized. <span class="italic">Acute DIC</span> is characterized by the abrupt onset of severe, generalized bleeding. The most common &#173;causes are obstetric complications (most notably abruptio placentae and amniotic fluid embolism), septicemia, shock, massive trauma, malignancy (especially acute promyelocytic leukemia), ABO incompatibility, and major surgical procedures. Bleeding, thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT/aPTT, reduced procoagulant &#173;factors, low plasma fibrinogen, and reduced levels of coagulation inhibitors are characteristics of acute DIC. Treatment, other than specific mea&#173;sures aimed at the under&#173;lying disease, is controversial. Among the modalities used are heparinization and replacement of blood, platelets, and fibrinogen.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Chronic DIC</span> is associated with disseminated solid-&#173;tumor neoplasms (pancreatic, ovarian, gastric, or brain) and autoimmune diseases. Laboratory values range from normal to moderately abnormal; levels of coagulation &#173;factors may even be elevated (high plasma fibrinogen). Bleeding and thrombosis (especially lower extremity deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) may occur, but the syndrome remains undiagnosed in most patients &#173;unless renal failure results from intravascular coagulation in the kidney. Many patients with chronic DIC do not require specific therapy for the coagulopathy &#173;because it is not severe enough to pres&#173;ent a major risk of bleeding or thrombosis. On occasion, chronic DIC may convert to the acute form.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Thrombotic disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The hypercoagulable states encompass a group of inherited and acquired thrombotic disorders that increase the risk of thrombosis <span class="italic">(thrombophilia).</span> The <span class="italic">primary hypercoagulable states</span> are caused by abnormalities of specific coagulation proteins resulting from inherited mutations in one of the antithrombotic &#173;factors. The trigger for a thrombotic event is often the development of one of the acquired secondary hypercoagulable states superimposed on an inherited state of hypercoagulability. The <span class="italic">secondary hypercoagulable states</span> lead to a thrombotic tendency by means of complex and often multifactorial mechanisms.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-21">Primary Hypercoagulable States</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Activated protein C re&#173;sis&#173;tance (&#173;factor V Leiden mutation)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Factor V is a procoagulant &#173;factor that amplifies thrombin production. Most patients with APC re&#173;sis&#173;tance harbor a single specific point mutation in the &#173;factor V gene, termed <span class="italic">&#173;factor V Leiden,</span> which renders both forms of &#173;factor V (active and inactive) insensitive to APC proteolysis<span class="italic">.</span> This mutation occurs with remarkable frequency (3%–7%) in healthy white populations but appears to be far less prevalent or even absent in certain black and Asian populations. The major clinical manifestation of the heterozygous form is deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, for which &#173;there is a lifetime risk of 5% in the general population but up to 20% in families with history of thrombophilia. Asymptomatic heterozygotes with no history of thromboembolic events do not need to be routinely screened for other thrombophilias or treated with anticoagulants except in high-&#173;risk situations such as surgery or pregnancy.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">Prothrombin G20210A gene mutation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene has been associated with elevated plasma levels of prothrombin. It is second only to &#173;factor V Leiden as a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic risk &#173;factor for venous thrombosis and is also a risk &#173;factor for premature cardiovascular disease. It is much more common among white populations than in other populations. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) increases 20-&#173;fold when both prothrombin G20210A and &#173;factor V Leiden mutation are pres&#173;ent in the same individual.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">Antithrombin deficiency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Antithrombin deficiency is rare. It leads to increased thrombin generation and, hence, fibrin accumulation with a lifelong propensity for thrombosis. A meta-&#173;analysis of case control and cohort studies showed a 16-&#173;fold increased risk of developing VTE in patients with antithrombin deficiency. This mutation may be acquired or hereditary.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">Protein C deficiency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Protein C deficiency is also rare, affecting between 0.2% and 0.5% of the general population. This disorder leads to un&#173;regu&#173;la&#173;ted fibrin generation due to impaired inactivation of &#173;factors VIIIa and Va. The risk of VTE in patients who have protein C deficiency is increased 7-&#173;fold compared to that of persons without this deficiency.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">Protein S deficiency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Protein S is the principal cofactor of APC; therefore, its deficiency mimics that of protein C. The prevalence of this condition in patients presenting with VTE is about 1%, and patients with protein S deficiency have 5 times the risk of developing VTE than &#173;those without this deficiency.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">Screening for inherited thrombophilia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Screening for &#173;these conditions in the unselected general population is not recommended &#173;because of the low prevalence, low and variable penetrance among carriers, and lack of safe and cost-&#173;effective prophylaxis. Screening would be appropriate in the following groups:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-8">pedigrees that include multiple first-&#173;degree relatives with inherited thrombophilia and VTE onset before age 50</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;family members of probands with symptomatic thrombophilia, particularly &#173;those who have protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiency</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">&#173;women who plan to use oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy and have a &#173;family history of VTE with thrombophilia</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Screening for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (<span class="italic">MTHFR</span>) gene variants, assaying homocysteine levels, or seeking plasminogen activator/promoter variants is not recommended, as &#173;there is no evidence that risk for blood clots is significantly higher or that prophylactic anticoagulation reduces risk.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Hyperhomocysteinemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hyperhomocysteinemia, which is caused by elevated blood levels of homocysteine, leads to severe neurologic developmental abnormalities in the homozygous state. Adults with the heterozygous state may have only thrombotic tendencies. Acquired &#173;causes of hyperhomocysteinemia in adults commonly involve nutritional deficiencies of pyridoxine, vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span>, and folate, all of which are cofactors in homocysteine metabolism. High blood concentration of homocysteine constitutes an in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent risk &#173;factor for both venous and arterial thrombosis; in contrast, all of the other primary hypercoagulable states are associated only with venous thromboembolic complications, usually involving the lower extremities. The initial treatment of acute venous thrombosis in &#173;these patients does not differ from that in patients without ge&#173;ne&#173;tic defects.</p>

			<p class="h3">Therapeutic anticoagulation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many clinical situations require intentional disruption of the hemostatic pro&#173;cess. The effect of aspirin on platelet function has already been discussed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is a mucopolysaccharide that binds antithrombin III, potentiating its effects and inhibiting the formation of thrombin. It is given intravenously or subcutaneously, and therapy is assessed by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the aPTT. Aspirin should not be given to patients receiving heparin &#173;because the resultant platelet dysfunction may provoke bleeding. Low-&#173;molecular-&#173;weight (LMW) heparins are another type of parenteral anticoagulant. LMW heparins have a number of advantages over UFH, including greater bioavailability when given by subcutaneous injection and greater duration of anticoagulant effect, permitting once-&#173; or twice-&#173;daily administration. The dose is highly correlated with body weight, allowing administration of a fixed dose, and laboratory monitoring is not necessary. In addition, the risk of heparin-&#173;induced thrombocytopenia is lower. <span class="italic">Direct parenteral thrombin inhibitors</span>, such as lepirudin, argatroban, and bivalirudin, are utilized during percutaneous coronary intervention and for the treatment of heparin-&#173;induced thrombocytopenia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There are 2 groups of <span class="italic">direct oral anticoagulants</span>: &#173;factor Xa inhibitors (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, dabigatran). &#173;These are fixed-&#173;dose oral agents that, unlike vitamin K antagonists, do not require routine laboratory monitoring or dose adjustments. Another advantage is that they reach their peak efficacy in 1–4 hours &#173;after ingestion; therefore, a period of bridging therapy is not required when switching from the initial treatment (eg, heparin) to &#173;these agents. Furthermore, unlike heparin and vitamin K antagonists, &#173;these drugs bind to circulating as well as clot-&#173;bound thrombin or &#173;factor Xa. &#173;Until recently, the major disadvantage of &#173;these drugs was that no antidotes &#173;were readily available in case of bleeding events. However, idarucizumab, a dabigatran-&#173;specific Fab fragment, is now available and has been shown in vitro to reverse the effect of dabigatran within 15 minutes. More recently andexanet alfa, a recombinant &#173;factor Xa decoy molecule, has been approved for reversal of rivaroxaban and apixaban. Ciraparantag, which can potentially inhibit the anticoagulant effect of &#173;factor Xa inhibitors, is &#173;under investigation but is not yet FDA-approved. Fondaparinux, which binds to antithrombin, is a synthetic anticoagulant that is very similar to UFH and LMW heparin. It exclusively catalyzes antithrombin inhibition of &#173;factor Xa. &#173;Because it is eliminated in the kidney, it should be used cautiously in patients with renal disease. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>, &#173;Table&#160;5-1, in this volume for a list of direct oral antithrombotic agents.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The orally administered warfarin derivatives, of which warfarin sodium is the most widely used, inhibit the production of normal vitamin K–&#173;dependent coagulation &#173;factors (II, VII, IX, and X). Therapeutic effect is assessed by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the patient’s INR. One critical issue is the long list of commonly used drugs that interact with warfarin. &#173;These interactions may cause an unintended increase or decrease in the INR, depending on the&#160;drug.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Heparin and the warfarin derivatives are used to prevent the formation of new thrombi and the propagation of existing thrombi, but neither affects the original clot. Thrombolytic agents such as streptokinase, urokinase, and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) are sometimes indicated to lyse existing thrombi, as in the very early stages of myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction and in the early treatment of thrombotic stroke. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>, &#173;Table&#160;5-2, in this volume for a list of intravenous and subcutaneous antithrombotic agents.</p>
