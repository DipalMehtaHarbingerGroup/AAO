			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ophthalmologists use clinical research to establish best practices for patient care. This chapter &#173;will help the clinician understand how to critically review research and apply the results to the clinical practice of ophthalmology.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Researching Answers to Clinical Questions</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Formulating the clinical question is the first step in resolving a diagnostic or management issue. Examples of clinical questions in ophthalmology include: What are the results of minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries in patients with low-&#173;pressure glaucoma versus higher-pressure glaucoma? Do racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States have a higher risk of proliferative vitreoretinopathy &#173;after pars plana vitrectomy? What is the expected survival of an endothelial graft in a patient with Fuchs dystrophy?</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinicians can use vari&#173;ous sources of information to research their answers to questions, including general textbooks on ophthalmology, review journals on specific subjects (eg, <span class="italic">Survey of Ophthalmology</span> [<a href="http://www.surveyophthalmol.com">www.&#173;surveyophthalmol.&#173;com</a>]), and educational material from the American Acad&#173;emy of Ophthalmology ([AAO]; <a href="http://www.aao.org/clinical-education">www.&#173;aao.&#173;org/&#173;clinical-&#173;education</a>) (eg, Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines, <span class="italic">Focal Points</span> modules). In addition, clinicians can use the Cochrane Library (<a href="http://www.cochranelibrary.com">www.&#173;cochranelibrary.&#173;com</a>) to access high-&#173;quality meta-&#173;analyses regarding specific management issues (eg, surgery for nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, intervention for involutional lower-&#173;eyelid ectropion).</p>
			<p class="body-text">PubMed (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">www.&#173;ncbi.&#173;nlm.&#173;nih.&#173;gov/&#173;pubmed</a>) is another &#173;great resource for primary sources of information. Clinicians with more specific questions or who are looking for specific data can narrow their search to the most applicable articles. PubMed provides detailed instructions on using appropriate keywords such as type of study: from laboratory-&#173;based studies of basic science (eg, cell culture, molecular biology) to animal studies (eg, testing of new drugs or specific surgical techniques) to clinical studies (eg, case reports, case series, randomized controlled &#173;trials).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Critical Reading of Studies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before committing time to reading a published study, the clinician should review its abstract to ascertain &#173;whether the study addresses the question of interest. &#173;After reviewing the abstract, the clinician should read the rest of the study critically to determine the characteristics of the study population, recruitment strategy, sample size, intervention, outcomes of interest, and statistical methods used, and thus evaluate &#173;whether the study is valid and applicable to the clinical question.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Are the study population and recruitment strategy applicable to my patients?</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Understanding a study’s population and its recruitment strategy is key to understanding the setting of the study. Was the trial clinic-&#173;based, multicenter, or community-&#173;based? In therapeutic &#173;trials, the inclusion and exclusion criteria describe the characteristics of &#173;those who &#173;were or &#173;were not treated with an intervention. Specific patient groups may have been excluded &#173;because they &#173;were considered a vulnerable population. For example, most &#173;trials of ocular hypotensive drugs exclude &#173;children and pregnant &#173;women; as a result, &#173;there are minimal data on the safety and efficacy of most ocular hypotensive agents in &#173;these 2 groups of patients. Thus, if a clinician wants to do research before deciding &#173;whether to use a specific ocular hypotensive agent in a pregnant &#173;woman or in a child, most of the evidence can be found only in individual case reports or retrospective case series.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The next step in evaluating a study is exploring &#173;whether the study created se&#173;lection bias by assigning the intervention to certain participants. Was the intervention randomly assigned? Was the treated group comparable to the control group? The purpose of randomly assigning an intervention to participants is to minimize bias on the part of the investigators and the patient. For example, an investigator may create se&#173;lection bias by inadvertently enrolling less complex patients for a new surgery, potentially biasing their outcomes &#173;toward better results.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Whether the se&#173;lection was biased or random can be determined by examining &#173;whether the participants assigned to each group are similar in the characteristics that may affect the outcome of interest. For example, when evaluating a study assessing the effect of &#173;laser treatment versus anti–&#173;vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (anti-&#173;VEGF) treatment on diabetic retinopathy, the clinician should examine &#173;whether patients’ hemoglobin A<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1c</span> levels, blood pressure, and severity of disease are similar between study groups, &#173;because &#173;these &#173;factors may alter the progression of retinopathy. Use of a control group is also impor&#173;tant &#173;because it indicates &#173;whether the results of the intervention are above and beyond beneficial effects of participants’ enrollment in a trial, which usually includes selected, motivated patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinical &#173;trials may study a narrow subset of a disease, making the results applicable and generalizable only to similar patients. A common error is extrapolating such data to apply to all patients or varying degrees of disease severity. For example, if a treatment is successful only in patients with mild glaucomatous damage who underwent trabeculectomy but not in &#173;those with advanced glaucomatous damage, the study results should be applied only to similar patients—in this case, patients with mild glaucomatous damage.</p>
			<p class="h3">Was the sample large enough to detect a difference?</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The sample size must have enough power to reject the <span class="italic">null hypothesis,</span> which states that &#173;there is no difference (in the outcome of interest) in the group that received the intervention compared with the group that did not receive the intervention. A study must have enough power to reject the null hypothesis. When this occurs, it suggests support for the “alternative hypothesis,” which states that a true difference exists between the groups. <span class="italic">Power</span> depends on the sample size (number of participants), the expected difference in the outcome of interest in the intervention group compared with the control group (eg, improvement in visual acuity, resolution of macular edema), and the variability (eg, standard deviation) of the outcome of interest. In general, an intervention with a larger treatment effect and smaller variability requires a smaller sample size. &#173;These characteristics should be reported in the Methods section of the study.</p>
			<p class="h3">Are the treatments and outcomes clinically relevant?</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician should ascertain &#173;whether the study’s results can be applied to his or her patients. Questions to consider include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Is the intervention available and applicable to the current practice environment?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Are the outcomes clinically impor&#173;tant?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Are all clinically impor&#173;tant outcomes evaluated?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">Is the treatment difference clinically significant?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">It is impor&#173;tant to consider &#173;whether the intervention is useful in practice. It may be too expensive, too difficult to perform, or no longer in general use. If so, the study may pose &#173;little benefit to current clinical care.</p>
			<p class="h3">Is the intervention reproducible?</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The study should describe the intervention in enough detail to allow the experiment to be replicated. For example, a surgical study should explain all the steps of the procedure so that dif&#173;fer&#173;ent surgeons are able to perform the procedure in the same manner in each case. Did all surgeons involved in the study perform it similarly, and &#173;were their results similar? Did the study include a training session before the start of the study, monitor specific aspects of the surgical procedure, and standardize postoperative care? In general, a study should avoid differences in study procedures except for the intervention of interest. In addition, to decrease the risk of investigator bias, the study should try to mask the observer to the intervention. <span class="italic">Investigator bias</span> may occur when the investigator expects a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent result in the intervention group and adjusts his or her mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the outcome of interest to satisfy this expectation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Is the outcome clearly defined and reliable?</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The study should clearly state the primary and secondary outcomes of interest as well as the expected change for &#173;these outcomes. For example, if the primary outcome is improvement in visual acuity, the study should indicate the logMAR value that represents improvement, the range, the distribution of results (eg, normal, skewed to the right or left), and the variability. &#173;These statements allow the reader to determine &#173;whether the study was able to prove or disprove the null hypothesis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many outcomes (eg, visual acuity, intraocular pressure [IOP], macular thickness as mea&#173;sured with optical coherence tomography [OCT]) &#173;will have mea&#173;sure&#173;ment error. This mea&#173;sure&#173;ment error &#173;will increase the variability of the outcome of interest or create a difference in results when no true difference in outcomes exists. Therefore, a study should standardize mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the outcome of interest for all investigators. For example, the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study created a standardized method to check IOP. The “recorder” placed the tonometry dial at 20&#160;mm Hg while an “observer” mea&#173;sured the IOP and adjusted the dial to the intersection of the tonometry mires without viewing the dial. Fi&#173;nally, the recorder recorded the IOP mea&#173;sure&#173;ment and changed the dial back to 20&#160;mm Hg, then repeated the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment sequence. The sequence was repeated a third time if the mea&#173;sure&#173;ments differed by 2&#160;mm Hg. By using a masked recorder and observer, and repeating the testing, the study created a standardized method intended to decrease mea&#173;sure&#173;ment error and the variability of IOP mea&#173;sure&#173;ment.</p>
			<p class="h3">Was the follow-up time and reporting long enough?</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The validity of a study is anchored on (1) adequate duration of follow-up and (2) follow-up of all participants. Thus, in evaluating a study, the clinician should look for how many of the participants completed follow-up and &#173;whether the study reported outcomes for all participants. For example, in a study assessing the use of atropine eyedrops versus patching for treatment of amblyopia, a follow-up of 3–6 months may be adequate; similar follow-up periods may be appropriate for tracking macular edema resolution &#173;after &#173;laser or drug therapy or monitoring visual acuity improvement &#173;after cataract extraction. Conversely, glaucoma progresses over long periods; therefore, &#173;trials assessing visual field loss in glaucoma would require longer follow-up, such as 5&#160;years. Consequently, the typical rate of disease progression is an impor&#173;tant guide in establishing the duration of follow-up required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fi&#173;nally, the study should report the results for all participants, which is called an “intention to treat” analy&#173;sis. The study should state the reasons for loss to follow-up, and any differences in reasons between the study groups. For example, participants in the intervention group of a drug trial may be more likely to drop out than &#173;those in the placebo group if they experience ocular adverse effects from the drug, such as burning or stinging.</p>
			<p class="h3">Is the analy&#173;sis appropriate for the outcome?</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Statistical tests depend on the type of data used to determine the difference between 2 treatment groups. For example, if the data are normally distributed (ie, parametric, conforming more or less to a bell-&#173;shaped curve) and are continuous (eg, age), then a <span class="italic">t</span> test comparing the intervention and control groups can be performed. For continuous data that are not normally distributed, researchers can use nonparametric tests such as the Mann-&#173;Whitney U test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test. For categorical data (pres&#173;ent or absent; small, medium, or large), the study may use a chi-&#173;square test. All of &#173;these tests provide a <span class="italic">P</span> value, which is a number that indicates the likelihood that a difference between the 2 groups is due to chance alone. For example, a <span class="italic">P</span> value of <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>.05 suggests that the likelihood that the difference between the 2 groups is due to chance alone is less than 5%. The lower the <span class="italic">P</span> value, the less likely it is that the difference is due to chance and the more likely it is that the difference represents a true difference. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;1-1</span> shows a flow chart for vari&#173;ous types of data and study designs.</p>
			<p class="h3">Is the difference between the groups clinically significant?</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Even though a statistical test may suggest a statistically significant difference in the results between 2 groups, the clinician should consider &#173;whether the magnitude and nature of the difference are clinically meaningful. For example, a statistically significant difference in visual acuity may only be 2 letters on a Snellen chart, but this difference may not be clinically noticeable to patients and may be within the margin of mea&#173;sure&#173;ment error for visual acuity. In addition to evaluating primary outcome variables, the study should evaluate secondary clinically impor&#173;tant variables related to the safety of the intervention. &#173;These variables include dropout rates, pain, and allergic reactions.</p>
			<p class="h3">Is &#173;there a conflict of interest?</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A conflict of interest (COI) occurs when a person or organ&#173;ization receives financial or other interests in an entity (eg, a device com&#173;pany) that could consciously or unconsciously motivate them to make decisions that benefit the entity. An example of a COI would be if a person who was a paid speaker for an entity wrote and published a paper describing that entity’s new device and its benefits. &#173;Because of the relationship between the author and the entity, &#173;there is a risk that the COI could positively influence the author’s decision-&#173;making in the entity’s &#173;favor. If the author of the paper biases the study results to describe large benefits for the device with minimal risk, the author may secondarily benefit by receiving more paid speaking engagements from the entity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although this COI and the author’s role in the paper may not represent an impropriety, such an impropriety is one reason that medical journals require authors and other decision makers to disclose any COIs. Secondarily and most importantly, medical journals also require the author and other individuals with COIs to pres&#173;ent an <span class="italic">accurate</span> and <span class="italic">balanced</span> assessment of the benefits and <span class="italic">all of the risks</span> of the drug or new device. Even if their motivations do not include a direct financial benefit in the form of COI, all authors are motivated to publish their findings in research journals, for reasons that may include academic promotion, &#173;future research grants, and their national reputation. Overall, any research should include an accurate and balanced assessment of the results regardless of &#173;whether the authors have COI, and readers should use their best judgment about &#173;whether the research includes a balanced pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of the results.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Understanding Study Design</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinical research uses a wide array of study designs. In <span class="italic">observational studies,</span> also known as <span class="italic">nonexperimental studies,</span> investigators evaluate characteristics, be&#173;hav&#173;iors, and exposures in participants with a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar disease, condition, or complication. An observational study reports only the characteristics of the study population; it does not directly manipulate be&#173;hav&#173;iors (eg, cigarette smoking) or exposures (eg, use of a medi&#173;cation, &#173;laser treatment). In <span class="italic">experimental studies,</span> typically clinical &#173;trials, subjects are assigned to a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar treatment, such as a prescribed be&#173;hav&#173;ior (eg, eating a diet high in antioxidant foods), or a therapeutic or preventive intervention (eg, use of an oral neuroprotective agent for patients with glaucoma, antioxidant vitamin supplementation for patients with early age-&#173;related macular degeneration [AMD]).</p>
			<p class="body-text">When conducted and interpreted appropriately, each type of study design may provide valuable information. Researchers employ observational studies when describing the pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion and progression of disease, generating hypotheses, and efficiently assessing data that may already exist for testing a hypothesis about an intervention. Examples of observational studies include case reports, case series, case-&#173;control studies, cross-&#173;sectional studies, and cohort studies. In contrast, prospective randomized controlled &#173;trials provide the best evidence regarding the effects of an intervention. Fi&#173;nally, meta-&#173;analyses provide a methodology to summarize the results of multiple clinical &#173;trials addressing similar research questions. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;1-2</span> depicts the levels of evidence that can be obtained from dif&#173;fer&#173;ent study designs; note that meta-&#173;analyses and controlled &#173;trials offer the highest levels of evidence.</p>
			<p class="h2">Case Reports</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A case report describes a finding in regard to a single patient to alert readers to a rare condition or unusual treatment result. For example, in 2005, Friedman reported ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis in an apparently healthy patient with none of the common &#173;causes of vasculitis, such as toxoplasmosis, syphilis, Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease, sarcoidosis, lupus, or herpes. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the patient’s brain revealed findings typical of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although clinicians recognize that ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis develops in MS patients, this study was the first to report ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis as the initial pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of MS. This case report demonstrated that clinicians should consider MS when they have tested for more common &#173;causes of vasculitis, but the etiology remains unclear.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Case reports cannot provide information on treatment efficacy or assert &#173;whether a disease is caused by an exposure. At most, they can suggest a previously unsuspected finding or mechanism of disease.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-7">Friedman SM. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis as the initial pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of multiple sclerosis. <span class="italic">Ret&#173;i&#173;na.</span> 2005;25(2):218–219.</p>
			<p class="h2">Case Series</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Case series investigate the pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, history, and/or follow-up of a group of patients and provide valuable information on the natu&#173;ral history or prognosis of a disease. Case series may differ from clinical &#173;trials in regard to patient se&#173;lection, patient characteristics, and length and completeness of follow-&#173;up; &#173;these characteristics may establish the quality and applicability of a case series. The case series provides preliminary information for a larger study with a comparison group.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Case series can include bias if they only include patients with severe disease from tertiary referral centers such as university-&#173;based clinics, or patients with only mild cases of a disease. For example, a study examining a new minimally invasive glaucoma surgery in patients with glaucoma may show incremental lowering of IOP and the need for fewer medi&#173;cations 6 months &#173;after the surgery. However, in the Methods section of the study, the reader discovers that the study population came from a tertiary glaucoma center that specialized in a new procedure to reduce patient dependence on drops. Also, the study only included patients with stable glaucoma. In other words, the study was biased &#173;toward patients with mild disease and was therefore not generalizable to patients with other severities of glaucoma; it was also biased to decrease the number of medi&#173;cations &#173;because the providers and patients involved in the study &#173;were motivated to decrease or stop their glaucoma drops &#173;after the procedure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Case series might not standardize the collection of patient information, mea&#173;sure&#173;ments, tests, and other evaluations. This may result in underreporting or overreporting of results. For example, the technicians, examination rooms, lighting, and charts used to mea&#173;sure visual acuity may differ within the vari&#173;ous clinics. Or study personnel may re&#173;cord visual acuity differently; for example, some may rec&#173;ord the nearest &#173;whole line (20/25) while &#173;others rec&#173;ord to the letter (20/25 <span class="symbol">+</span> 2).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lengths of follow-up intervals may vary within a single case series. If &#173;there are differences in follow-up time, the study should report what the specific follow-up times &#173;were, such as 1, 2, and 3&#160;years &#173;after the initiation of treatment. When the outcome being mea&#173;sured is an event, such as corneal graft failure, a <span class="italic">survival analy&#173;sis</span> can account for the varying lengths of follow-up. If the study does not follow all of its participants for the full length of the pos&#173;si&#173;ble follow-up period, &#173;these losses to follow-up may cause the reported outlook for the case series to be biased. For example, in a case series of patients with macular edema from branch ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion, some patients may choose not to return &#173;because their macular edema has resolved, and their vision has improved; some patients may experience further loss of vision and seek care from another ophthalmologist; and some patients may move to another location. Overall, if a large percentage of patients do not return for complete follow-up, the study results may not be valid; the remaining subjects may have had an unusually good or unusually bad course compared with the subjects lost to follow-&#173;up.</p>
			<p class="h2">Case-&#173;Control Studies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;1-3</span> illustrates the structure of case-&#173;control studies. Case-&#173;control studies investigate a hypothesis about an association between exposures or potential risk &#173;factors (eg, smoking, medical conditions, therapies) and outcomes of interest (eg, loss of visual acuity, development of glaucoma, corneal graft failure, complications of cataract surgery). Case-&#173;control studies select a group of participants with the disease of interest (cases) and a group of comparable individuals who are &#173;free of disease (controls). Each study compares the past exposures and characteristics of the 2 groups to determine &#173;whether differences exist between the groups. If so, the study &#173;will conclude that the exposures or characteristics that differ are associated with the disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Researchers select cases and controls from a current database and obtain the history of exposures through patient surveys and/or review of medical rec&#173;ords. Thus, researchers can perform case-&#173;control studies more quickly and inexpensively than cohort studies (discussed &#173;later in the chapter), &#173;because cohort studies require extra time and money to follow participants. During rec&#173;ord reviews or patient interviews, case-&#173;control studies can collect data on many potential risk &#173;factors si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, exposure data may be less accurate in case-&#173;control studies than in cohort studies. For example, patients with ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion (cases) may be more likely than control patients to recall taking medi&#173;cations (eg, aspirin) in the past &#173;because control patients, who do not have the disease, may be less motivated to scrutinize their past be&#173;hav&#173;ior. Therefore, a higher proportion of cases than controls might report use of aspirin in the past 6 months, even if in truth the proportion of aspirin users was the same in both cases and controls. This <span class="italic">recall bias</span> in cases may strengthen the association between aspirin use and vein occlusion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Case-&#173;control studies may be subject to se&#173;lection bias if they do not have an appropriate control group. For example, a study may show that myopia offers a protective effect on ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion if the study collects its cases from a ret&#173;i&#173;nal group but collects its controls from a general ophthalmology practice that offers refractive surgery for myopia. The proportion of individuals with myopia would be smaller among the cases (from the ret&#173;i&#173;nal group) than among the controls (from the general practice). The study may conclude that myopia is protective against ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion, but the apparent association would actually be attributable to se&#173;lection bias. To learn more about other sources of bias, an interested reader may consult general epidemiology textbooks, such as the following.</p>

			<p class="h2">Cross-&#173;Sectional Studies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cross-&#173;sectional studies correlate exposures and risk &#173;factors with the presence of disease without the benefit of knowing the timing or sequence of exposure and disease development. An example of a cross-&#173;sectional study is one in which a researcher collects a blood sample from patients and rec&#173;ords their lens status (phakic, pseudophakic, or aphakic) at the same time. The study could evaluate the association between a history of cataract surgery (case status) and cholesterol level and gender (potential risk &#173;factors). However, if the mean cholesterol level is higher in cases than in &#173;those without a history of cataract surgery, the researcher would not know &#173;whether the elevated cholesterol level occurred before cataract surgery. With this study design, it is also impor&#173;tant to consider &#173;whether a <span class="italic">confounding &#173;factor</span> may be affecting the association. For this study, age could be a confounding &#173;factor, &#173;because cholesterol levels increase with age, as does the likelihood of cataract surgery. The researcher could use data analy&#173;sis tools such as stratification and/or regression analy&#173;sis to adjust for age and then determine &#173;whether the cholesterol–&#173;cataract surgery association is still pres&#173;ent in each of the age strata.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cohort Studies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Researchers may use cohort, or follow-up, studies to investigate the association between exposures or potential risk &#173;factors and patient outcomes. &#173;These studies identify subjects who are &#173;free of the disease of interest and classify them by the presence or absence of potential risk &#173;factors. Then the study follows &#173;these subjects for subsequent development of the disease of interest (<span class="xref-local">see Fig 1-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES) is an example of a population-&#173;based &#173;cohort study with prospective data collection. This study examined and interviewed approximately 6000 residents of Los Angeles, California, and followed them longitudinally for the incidence of ocular disease. Researchers explored potential risk &#173;factors for diseases such as AMD, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataract using the residents’ exposures at the beginning of the study and the incidence of the diseases years &#173;later. For example, the investigators discovered new cases of macular degeneration over a 4-&#173;year period in Latino individuals. The study found that older age and pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic pressure) &#173;were in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dently associated with new onset early AMD, soft indistinct drusen, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigmentary abnormalities. This is an example of prospectively assessing the risk &#173;factor (blood pressure and age) for an outcome of interest (incidence of AMD).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cohort studies can provide associations between risk &#173;factors and disease. The primary weakness of this study design is that participants with the risk &#173;factor of interest may differ in many ways from &#173;those without the risk &#173;factor, and &#173;those other characteristics may affect the incidence of the disease. One example relates to the higher incidence of graft failure among patients with interrupted sutures. It would be inaccurate to conclude that use of interrupted sutures increases the risk of graft failure, &#173;because ophthalmologists use interrupted sutures in patients with a preexisting risk of graft failure, such as stromal vascularization. In this example, stromal vascularization is a confounding &#173;factor. Statistical analy&#173;sis techniques, such as stratified analy&#173;sis and regression analy&#173;sis, can adjust for the effect of known confounding &#173;factors. However, quite often investigators do not understand all the &#173;factors that affect the incidence of a disease. For this reason, cohort studies may identify associations and disease incidence, but &#173;these associations are not considered causal.</p>

			<p class="h2">Clinical &#173;Trials</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;1-4</span> demonstrates the major difference between clinical &#173;trials and cohort studies: clinical &#173;trials randomly assign patients to dif&#173;fer&#173;ent treatment groups (exposure groups). Random assignment yields treatment groups with similar characteristics in regard to variables that may alter outcomes or the risk of complications from the treatment. This control of confounding &#173;factors is a major advantage of clinical &#173;trials over other study designs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All the previously mentioned features of high-&#173;quality observational studies, such as the following, should also be applied to randomized controlled &#173;trials:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">a well-&#173;defined research question and objectives</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">an adequate sample size</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">standardized procedures</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">predefined, objective primary and secondary outcomes</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">masking of patients, treating clinicians, and evaluators to the assigned treatment</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">complete follow-up of all patients</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting &#173;Trials) Statement, an evidence-&#173;based set of recommendations, includes a checklist of features that should be included in the design and reporting of clinical &#173;trials.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When evaluating a clinical trial, the clinician should consider 2 issues in addition to the other features of high-&#173;quality studies. The first is &#173;whether the study excluded patients from data analy&#173;sis &#173;because they did not meet all of the eligibility criteria, experienced adverse effects and stopped treatment, or did not adhere to the treatment regimen. Exclusion of &#173;these types of patients creates biased results &#173;because the excluded patients’ results may differ from &#173;those of the patients included in the analy&#173;sis. For this reason, clinical &#173;trials should include an intention-&#173;to-&#173;treat analy&#173;sis, which includes the data from all enrolled participants, and separate analyses of &#173;those who completed the trial and &#173;those who did not.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Results from subgroups of patients (eg, young vs old, hypertensive vs nonhypertensive) should be regarded with suspicion. By statistical chance alone, a study can identify a subgroup of patients for whom the benefit of treatment is statistically significant. A subgroup evaluation may be considered valid if the investigators identified the subgroup a priori in the study design, treatment results vary similarly across subgroups (eg, success steadily decreases in each age stratum as the participants become younger), and a biologically plausible explanation exists for the finding.</p>
			<p class="h2">Systematic Reviews and Meta-&#173;analyses of Clinical &#173;Trials</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because they combine evidence from 2 or more clinical &#173;trials, systematic reviews and meta-&#173;analyses provide the strongest evidence for assessing interventions for a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar condition (<span class="xref-local">see Fig 1-2</span>). For example, to compare the safety and efficacy of intracameral cefuroxime, moxifloxacin, and vancomycin at the end of cataract surgery, Bowen and colleagues reviewed the results of 17 studies with over 900,000 eyes. They showed an 80% decrease (<span class="italic">P</span> <span class="symbol">&lt;</span> .001) in risk of endophthalmitis when using intracameral antibiotics. They also reported minimal toxicity for moxifloxacin; dosing errors related to toxicity for cefur&#173;oxime; and rare toxic ret&#173;i&#173;nal events with vancomycin use. Overall, this meta-&#173;analysis strongly supports intracameral antibiotics &#173;after cataract surgery to prevent endophthalmitis.</p>

			<p class="h1">Interpreting Diagnostic and Screening Tests</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goal of this section is to help the reader interpret diagnostic and screening tests. The first example pres&#173;ents a relatively straightforward case; it involves a screening test with a binary (yes/no) outcome, a disease that the patient &#173;either has or does not have, and a patient about whom nothing is known at the time of screening. The subsequent discussions examine complicating features that often occur in ophthalmic practice and in research. The reader should consider &#173;these complicating features when evaluating results of diagnostic and screening tests.</p>
			<p class="h2">The Straightforward Case</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A fictitious study evaluates use of a &#173;simple, quick strabismus test in 100 &#173;children, comparing it to a longer, more expensive full examination with a pediatric ophthalmologist as the <span class="italic">gold standard.</span> The study finds that 30 &#173;children have strabismus and 70 do not. However, &#173;after undergoing the quick screening test, 60 &#173;children have abnormal results and 40 &#173;children have normal results. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;1-1</span> shows the screening test result data. The screening test per&#173;for&#173;mance is described as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Sensitivity:</span> The test correctly identifies 20 of &#173;every 30 &#173;children who have strabismus (67%). The equation is a/(a <span class="symbol">+</span> c). The denominator, (a <span class="symbol">+</span> c), represents all of the test subjects who have the disease (strabismus).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Specificity:</span> The test correctly identifies 30 of &#173;every 70 &#173;children who do not have strabismus (43%). The equation is d/(b <span class="symbol">+</span> d). The denominator (b <span class="symbol">+</span> d), represents all of the test subjects who do not have the disease (normal).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Positive predictive value (PPV):</span> If a child’s test results are abnormal, &#173;there is only a 1&#160;in 3 chance (20/60) that the child actually has strabismus (33%). The equation is a/(a <span class="symbol">+</span> b). The denominator, (a <span class="symbol">+</span> b), represents all of the subjects with abnormal test results.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Negative predictive value (NPV):</span> If a child’s test results are normal, &#173;there is a 3&#160;in 4 chance (30/40) that the child is actually disease-&#173;free (75%). The equation is d/(d <span class="symbol">+</span> c). The denominator, (d <span class="symbol">+</span> c), represents all the test subjects with normal test results.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">Accuracy:</span> The screening test is correct in 50 of 100 cases (50%). The equation to determine accuracy is (a <span class="symbol">+</span> d)/(a <span class="symbol">+</span> b <span class="symbol">+</span>c <span class="symbol">+</span> d).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Sensitivity</span> is the percentage of test subjects who both have the disease of interest and have abnormal test results, and <span class="italic">specificity</span> is the percentage of disease-&#173;free &#173;people who have normal results. However, it is also impor&#173;tant to remember that neither sensitivity nor specificity takes into account the prevalence of disease in the study population.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;1-2</span> illustrates the per&#173;for&#173;mance of the hy&#173;po&#173;thet&#173;i&#173;cal strabismus test if it yields the same results (60 &#173;children with abnormal test results and 40 &#173;children with normal test results) when performed in a shopping center where the prevalence of strabismus is only 3% (much lower than in the situation previously discussed). The sensitivity is still 67%, and the specificity is about the same, at 40%. However, &#173;because of the high number of falsely abnormal results, 58 &#173;children without disease and only 2 &#173;children who truly have strabismus would be referred for complete examinations. In this example, the PPV is only 3% (2/60). The NPV is 98% (39/40). &#173;Because of the low prevalence of strabismus in this setting, most &#173;children whose test results &#173;were abnormal would actually be disease-&#173;free. This increases the costs of unnecessary follow-up testing and increases anxiety for the parents. Clearly, the prevalence of disease in the population of interest and the screening test’s PPV and NPV should be considered before the test is used for screening a population.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Choosing a gold standard is a key aspect of conducting a diagnostic testing study. The reader of such a study should ascertain &#173;whether the gold standard (in this case a pediatric ophthalmologist) was <span class="italic">masked</span> to the results of the strabismus test; if not, this may have created confirmatory bias, potentially artificially increasing the diagnostic precision of the screening test. The gold standard should also have been previously published and accepted by contemporaneous experts. Fi&#173;nally, the gold standard should be repeatable &#173;under the same conditions; for example, would the pediatric ophthalmologist come to the same diagnosis (strabismus vs. no strabismus) if they examined the child a second time? In conclusion, the gold standard should be scrutinized for its applicability to the clinical situation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Complicating Features</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Using ROC curves to compare dif&#173;fer&#173;ent screening thresholds with a continuous predictive variable</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When the screening test mea&#173;sures a continuous value, such as IOP, it becomes more complicated to evaluate the screening test. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;1-5</span> uses data from the Baltimore Eye Survey to graphically display sensitivity and specificity for each value of IOP. The usual cutoff for normal IOP, 21&#160;mm Hg, has a sensitivity of 49% and a specificity of 90%. The intersection of sensitivity and specificity is the optimal threshold for maximum sensitivity and specificity in a screening test. This intersection occurs at 18&#160;mm Hg, where the sensitivity is 65% and the specificity is 66%. With continuous variables, like IOP, &#173;there is a trade-&#173;off between sensitivity and specificity: a higher sensitivity results in a lower specificity, and vice versa.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;1-6</span> depicts another graphical repre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of sensitivity and specificity called a <span class="italic">receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve</span>. By convention, an ROC curve plots sensitivity on the y-&#173;axis and (1 – &#173;specificity) on the x-&#173;axis. The larger the area &#173;under the curve, the more diagnostically precise is the screening test. The line with the diamond-&#173;shaped symbols represents a hy&#173;po&#173;thet&#173;i&#173;cal screening test with optimal results; the line with the triangles represents a poor screening test with an ROC area of only 50%; and the line with the circles—&#173;the &#173;middle curve—&#173;represents the Baltimore Eye Survey data used in <span class="xref-local">Figure&#160;1-5</span>. An ROC curve can inform se&#173;lection of an optimal cutoff point for a screening test by identifying the sensitivity–&#173;specificity pair located closest to the upper left of the ROC plot.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Overall, &#173;these figures demonstrate that IOP mea&#173;sure&#173;ment is not a very good &#173;screening tool for glaucoma because no cut-off reaches the ideal sensitivity/specificity (upper left of diamond line). Other significant &#173;factors in choosing a cutoff point for a screening test are the population to be screened and the relative importance of sensitivity and specificity. If the consequence of missing a diagnosis is very impor&#173;tant such as blindness, an investigator may choose a test with high sensitivity but poor specificity. For example, a low cutoff for erythrocyte sedimentation rate might be chosen for a person who has recent vision loss and who is suspected of having &#173;giant cell arteritis.</p>

			<p class="h3">Using ROC curves to compare dif&#173;fer&#173;ent screening devices</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Studies can use ROC curves to compare new diagnostic tests. ROC curves can be used to compare tests that use dif&#173;fer&#173;ent units or dif&#173;fer&#173;ent scales. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;1-7</span> shows 3 ROC curves illustrating the ability of 3 glaucoma imaging devices to discriminate between healthy eyes and eyes with glaucomatous visual field loss via imaging of the optic nerve head and nerve fiber layer. The area &#173;under each ROC curve represents a summary mea&#173;sure of the relative efficacy of the screening test. The ROC curves appear similar for inferior average nerve fiber layer thickness as mea&#173;sured with OCT and for scanning &#173;laser polarimetry with variable corneal compensation (GDx VCC nerve fiber index), while the ROC curve for confocal scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscopy (HRT linear discriminant function) is lower. In other words, the figure suggests a higher diagnostic precision for scanning &#173;laser polarimetry and OCT than confocal scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscopy.</p>

			<p class="h3">The effect of pretest probability of disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pretest probability of disease uses knowledge of the patient before any screening or diagnostic tests are performed. For example, the investigator may know that the patient has a first-&#173;degree relative with glaucoma as well as a thinner-&#173;than-&#173;average central corneal thickness (both are risk &#173;factors for glaucoma). This information suggests a pretest probability of glaucoma about 3 times higher than that of a person picked at random from the general population. How much does a diagnostic test improve the ability to diagnose glaucoma in this patient with a higher pretest probability? How much higher is the relative risk of glaucoma if the test result is positive?</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Bayes theorem</span> allows the pretest probability of disease to be combined with the diagnostic precision of a screening test to produce a posttest probability of disease. To use this theorem, the <span class="italic">likelihood ratio</span> must be calculated. The likelihood ratio of a positive test is the sensitivity divided by (1 <span class="symbol">−</span> specificity). For a sample test with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity (0.8/[1 <span class="symbol">−</span> 0.9]), the positive likelihood ratio is 8. The likelihood ratio of a negative test is (1 <span class="symbol">−</span> sensitivity) divided by the specificity. For the same sample test, the negative likelihood ratio is (1 <span class="symbol">−</span> 0.8)/0.9, or 0.22. Positive likelihood ratios start at 1 and continue to infinity—&#173;the bigger, the better. Negative likelihood ratios range from 0 to 1—&#173;the smaller, the better. If the goal is to diagnose disease, the test with the larger positive likelihood ratio is the better test; conversely, if the goal is to rule out disease, the test with the smaller negative likelihood ratio is better.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the positive likelihood ratio is multiplied by the pretest probability of disease, the result is the <span class="italic">posttest probability of disease.</span> Thus, for the example patient with the positive &#173;family history, thin cornea, and pretest probability of 3, a positive test with a positive likelihood ratio of 8 &#173;will result in a posttest probability of glaucoma that is 24 times that of a person drawn at random from the population.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;1-3</span> demonstrates another impor&#173;tant consideration regarding pretest probability of disease. Consider the case of a 65-&#173;year-&#173;old &#173;woman with no risk &#173;factors for glaucoma and a pretest probability of disease of 1.0%. A positive test result for glaucoma would raise her probability of disease to 7.5%. Most patients with a positive test result would not actually have the disease! Similarly, an 85-&#173;year-&#173;old man with a strong positive &#173;family history, thin central corneal thickness, and an IOP of 30&#160;mm Hg might have a pretest probability of disease of 50.0%. If his test result &#173;were negative, he would still have a posttest probability of disease of 18.2%, greater than that of the 65-&#173;year-&#173;old &#173;woman! This example illustrates the importance of considering the pretest probability of disease in deciding &#173;whether to employ a diagnostic test. In general, screening tests do not perform well when the prevalence of disease is low.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intermediate diagnostic categories, such as “glaucoma suspect,” are often encountered in clinical practice. Sensitivity–&#173;specificity and ROC curves cannot account for such categories, &#173;because they require borderline subjects to be categorized as &#173;either having the disease (eg, glaucoma) or not having it (eg, no glaucoma). However, a likelihood ratio can be calculated for a borderline category, which reflects the risk of patients exhibiting that characteristic (eg, “glaucoma suspect”).</p>
			<p class="h3">Use of tests in combination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Studies can combine tests in series or in parallel. An example of combining 2 tests <span class="italic">in series</span> is when a clinician performs the second test only if the first is positive. The correlation between the 2 tests must be considered when they are used in series. Consider the following case: a study uses cup–&#173;disc ratio, determined via optic nerve head photography, as a diagnostic test. If the result is positive, the peripapillary ret&#173;i&#173;nal nerve fiber layer thickness observed on OCT imaging is used to confirm the diagnosis. The study provides likelihood ratios for each test. Although it may be tempting to use the product of the 2 likelihood ratios and the pretest probability to calculate a posttest probability, if the screening tests are correlated with one another the predictive ability &#173;will appear artificially higher. &#173;Because cup–&#173;disc ratio and ret&#173;i&#173;nal nerve fiber layer thickness both examine tissues of the optic nerve head, albeit using dif&#173;fer&#173;ent technologies, they are highly correlated. Thus, &#173;because the 2 tests are not in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent, the results from the per&#173;for&#173;mance of the 2-&#173;test strategy are likely to be disappointing in comparison with the posttest probability calculated from the product of the 2 likelihood ratios and the pretest probability.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other studies have combined tests <span class="italic">in parallel</span>, considering the result positive if &#173;either test result is positive. This strategy works best when the tests have good specificity (combining tests this way makes overall specificity deteriorate) and address dif&#173;fer&#173;ent aspects of a disease. Kopplin and colleagues found that a visual acuity of less than 20/40, abnormal/poor-&#173;quality nonmydriatic imaging, abnormal frequency doubling perimetry, or abnormal/poor-&#173;quality confocal scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscopy resulted in an ROC curve area of 0.827 for detection of visually significant eye disease (eg, cataract, macular degeneration, glaucoma).</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Clinical ac&#173;cep&#173;tance and ethics of testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinicians should avoid tests that provide a small increment in the likelihood ratio of detecting disease or that are expensive or painful. In addition, all tests carry some burden, including the potential for adverse effects (eg, corneal abrasion from tonometry), psychological fear of a disease (eg, related to a screening test for glaucoma), and additional testing and follow-up examinations for abnormal or unusual results. A clinician should avoid a test if it &#173;will not change the management of the patient. Similarly, screening for eye disease should include a pro&#173;cess for follow-up of &#173;those who have abnormal results, regardless of their insurance status. Screening provides &#173;little value to participants who are told they might have a disease but are given no method of obtaining a follow-up evaluation or treatment.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Generalizability</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most studies investigate new screening or diagnostic tests in a clinical setting before evaluating them in a population-&#173;based sample (largely &#173;because of the high cost of performing population-&#173;based research). Clinicians should consider &#173;whether the data for a new test &#173;will apply to their screening population. Even a clinic-&#173;based study may not have patients like &#173;those in another practice. For example, a study may include only young glaucoma patients without other eye diseases, such as macular degeneration. This leads to excellent sensitivity and specificity, but the results may differ in a sample of patients who have borderline glaucoma and are older.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Summary</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Researchers use a variety of mea&#173;sures to evaluate the diagnostic precision of screening and diagnostic tests. Sensitivity and specificity are the simplest and easiest to understand, but their disadvantage is that they do not account for the prevalence of disease in the target population. PPV and NPV are more useful in that regard. ROC curves provide a comprehensive view of the relationship between the sensitivity and specificity of a continuous test result (eg, IOP) and can be used to compare diagnostic tests. Clinicians can use likelihood ratios and pretest probability of disease to critically evaluate screening and diagnostic tests in their clinical setting.</p>

			<p class="h1">Discussing Benefits, Risks, Probabilities, and Expected <br />Outcomes With Patients</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Physicians and their clinical team members need to educate patients regarding their disease, including potential preventive mea&#173;sures, treatments, and outcomes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinical research defines <span class="italic">risk</span> as the conditional probability of an event, usually an adverse event. <span class="italic">Risk difference</span> is the absolute difference in the risk between 2 groups of individuals. <span class="italic">Relative risk</span> is the ratio of 2 risk mea&#173;sures. The risk difference depends on the unit of mea&#173;sure, whereas relative risk is dimensionless &#173;because it involves division of 2 risk mea&#173;sure&#173;ments. In the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS), the risk difference of glaucoma development for subjects who &#173;were not treated compared with &#173;those who &#173;were treated was 5% (9.5%–4.5%) across 5&#160;years. The relative risk of not being treated compared with receiving treatment was 211% (9.5%/4.5%). Both mea&#173;sures are consistent with the data, but clinicians or patients may interpret them very differently. Numerically, a 5% increased risk of glaucoma (if ocular hypertension is not treated) might seem small to a patient, while a 211% increased risk might seem large. A key piece of information that may help in the interpretation of such results is the <span class="italic">baseline probability of the outcome.</span> For example, the baseline probability of developing glaucoma with untreated ocular hyper&#173;tension is 9.5%. In most cases, baseline probabilities or expected outcomes can help patients understand risk and make an informed decision about a procedure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">number needed to treat (NNT)</span> can also be helpful when describing how likely a treatment or medi&#173;cation &#173;will improve an outcome for an individual patient. In the above example, the study shows a 5% absolute risk reduction (ARR) in the proportion of patients without glaucoma if they use ocular hypotensive medi&#173;cations. The ARR is 5%, and the number needed to treat is 20 (100/5). In other words, a clinician could tell the patient that in order to prevent 1 patient from developing glaucoma over 5&#160;years, 20 patients would need to be treated with ocular hypotensive medi&#173;cations. Armed with this information, the patient can decide &#173;whether to use an ocular hypotensive medi&#173;cation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For &#173;those providers with capitated payments, it may be useful to consider the impact of the new procedure or treatment on societal cost. This cost can be determined by calculating the added cost using the NNT. For example, if the retail cost of a generic glaucoma medi&#173;cation for 1 patient is $70/month, or $4200 over 5&#160;years, the excess cost of using &#173;ocular hypotensive medi&#173;cations calculated with the NNT would be $84,000 ($4200 <span class="symbol">×</span> 20) for 1 patient to see the benefits from using &#173;these ocular hypotensive medi&#173;cations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The advantage of the NNT is that it only uses absolute risk reduction and is less likely to exaggerate the impact of a new procedure or medi&#173;cation. However, the NNT does not take other impor&#173;tant &#173;factors into consideration, such as the negative effects on quality of life related to eyedrop use, nor other pos&#173;si&#173;ble &#173;factors such as systemic adverse effects resulting from the use of ocular medi&#173;cations. The NNT does provide a straightforward attempt to describe the likelihood that a patient &#173;will be helped, harmed, or unaffected by a treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In observational studies, investigators may also pres&#173;ent their results as <span class="italic">odds ratios.</span> In an odds ratio, the odds of a subject with the disease (case) having an exposure (eg, smoking) are compared with the odds of a subject without the disease (control) having the exposure. When the disease is rare, the odds ratio approximates the relative risk of the exposure, &#173;because the denominators for both the odds &#173;under comparison are close to 1. For example, in the meta-&#173;analyses on potential risk &#173;factors for late AMD, which occurs relatively infrequently, the odds ratio for smoking is 2.35, meaning smokers have a 235% risk for development of late AMD compared with nonsmokers. As previously stated, the baseline risk is key; if it is low (ie, less than 1%), then an odds ratio of 2.0 still results in a low risk for an individual patient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Exposure to specific &#173;factors may or may not be clinically significant, and it may not be <span class="italic">causal</span>, or one of the root &#173;causes of the disease. &#173;Because it is difficult to distinguish causal risk &#173;factors from noncausal risk &#173;factors in observational studies, researchers often use causal criteria to identify which risk &#173;factors are causal and which are not.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Medical providers use <span class="italic">risk calculators</span> in a number of ways, for example, to predict an individual patient’s risk of cardiovascular disease, risk of having a child with Down syndrome, likelihood of survival from an intensive care unit, and likelihood of experiencing other medical conditions. Ophthalmologists have used risk calculators to help simplify complex study results and apply &#173;these results to individual patients. For example, the OHTS regression equation used 5 variables (cup–&#173;disc ratio, central corneal thickness, untreated IOP, pattern standard deviation from the visual field, and age) to predict the risk of a patient developing glaucoma as a result of ocular hypertension. The OHTS risk calculator is available for &#173;free online (<a href="https://ohts.wustl.edu/risk/">https://&#173;ohts.&#173;wustl.&#173;edu/&#173;risk/</a>&#173;). Other available risk calculators include &#173;those for macular degeneration, keratoconus, and glaucoma progression. Many risk calculators can be downloaded onto a mobile device. Overall, the advantage of risk calculators is that they simplify complex results to provide an estimate of the mean baseline probability of disease development or surgery complications in individual patients. Risk calculators can also identify &#173;those patients at high risk of developing disease and select them for a lower NNT and lower societal costs.</p>

			<div id="Chapt1_Top6">
			<p class="h2-h1">Using Big Data to Improve Clinical Practice</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Large studies using claims data have demonstrated considerable regional differences in practice and in the quality of eye care in the United States and worldwide. For example, Stein and colleagues showed a large difference in the use of &#173;laser trabeculoplasty between ophthalmologists and optometrists in Oklahoma. &#173;Were &#173;these high usage rates standards of care, or did they represent overusage, particularly when compared to other treatments?</p>
			<p class="body-text">An analy&#173;sis of the Medicare database revealed that some ophthalmologists had large Medicare expenditures when compared with those of the average ophthalmologist. This big data analy&#173;sis, among &#173;others, prompted investigators to discover fraud in our health care system. Big data can also be used to evaluate how individual ophthalmologists compare to their peers for an outcome of interest, such as the proportion of patients who need to return to the operating room &#173;after cataract surgery. If an ophthalmologist has a higher complication rate than that of his or her peers, this information may prompt that ophthalmologist to begin a quality improvement proj&#173;ect to lower their patient complication rate via education and further training. Big data offer clinicians many opportunities to mea&#173;sure and improve eye care, particularly when accompanied by an organ&#173;izing framework to &#173;understand the data and develop improvement activities (<span class="xref-local">see the following sections</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2">Issues in Designing a Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment System</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A useful mea&#173;sure&#173;ment system may include quality indicators. For example, one question ophthalmologists commonly face is &#173;whether they have dilated a diabetic patient’s eyes at least once &#173;every 2&#160;years. How might one validate that a dilated eye examination was performed? One cumbersome validation method would be to video rec&#173;ord ophthalmologists while they perform patient examinations and then review that recording to confirm the completion of the dilated eye examination. Other validation options may include (1)&#160;written documentation indicating that dilating drops &#173;were placed in the eye; (2) notations in the medical rec&#173;ord indicating that a peripheral dilated eye examination was performed, such as noting &#173;whether it was normal or abnormal; and (3) a diagram or drawing of the ret&#173;ina periphery. All of &#173;these would be valid mea&#173;sures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once a valid mea&#173;sure has been chosen, <span class="italic">reliability</span> needs to be determined. First, the analy&#173;sis should yield the same results if performed by the same clinician at a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent time. For example, are the same results obtained when a mea&#173;sure is made with the same instrument the second time and the third? Mea&#173;sures that minimize errors when repeated have good <span class="italic">test–&#173;retest reliability,</span> or reproducibility. Second, the analy&#173;sis should yield the same results if performed on the same subject multiple times. If the person &#173;doing the mea&#173;sure&#173;ment gets the same results on the same subject, &#173;after multiple attempts, &#173;there is good <span class="italic">intrarater reliability.</span> Third, the analy&#173;sis should yield the same results if performed by dif&#173;fer&#173;ent clinicians. Organ&#173;izations should design mea&#173;sures (as well as a training system for the staff and a support system that &#173;will capture and analyze the data) to allow dif&#173;fer&#173;ent &#173;people to use the same mea&#173;sure and obtain similar results. Mea&#173;sures that have this characteristic are said to have good <span class="italic">interrater reliability.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">In research, 2 statistical techniques are commonly used to determine the degree of agreement between 2 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent tests that detect a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar disease in a group of patients. One method is to simply tally the number of times that the results of the 2 tests agree (ie, both tests indicate disease pres&#173;ent, both tests indicate no disease) and then divide that number by the total number of items being assessed, thereby yielding the <span class="italic">&#173;percent agreement.</span> Another method, the <span class="greek">j</span> (kappa) statistic, mea&#173;sures the agreement between 2 or more individuals or entities while taking into account the potential for agreement via chance alone. Kappas greater than 0.75 represent excellent agreement; &#173;those from 0.40 to 0.75, fair to good agreement; and &#173;those below 0.40, poor agreement. However, not all experts agree on &#173;these kappa cutoff points; and other cutoffs for agreement may be recommended.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once a valid and reliable mea&#173;sure has been established, the organ&#173;ization should first consider the population of interest and the inclusion and exclusion criteria. For example, a study of the quality of cataract surgery might exclude ret&#173;ina specialists (exclusion criterion) and include only comprehensive ophthalmologists who spend at least 50% of their time seeing patients (inclusion criterion).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Second, the organ&#173;ization needs to determine &#173;whether the studied event occurs at a frequency that &#173;will allow meaningful differences to be found. Are the events so rare (“floor effect”) or so common (“ceiling effect”) that &#173;little value is to be gained in using such a mea&#173;sure&#173;ment system? Organ&#173;izations should consider conducting a pi&#173;lot study to investigate &#173;these issues before implementing a system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Third, whenever pos&#173;si&#173;ble, organ&#173;izations should use mea&#173;sures that are easily obtained, yet are valid and reliable. Systems that do not require much additional work are more practical for the purpose of monitoring practices. Thus, billing files may provide sufficient information on the completion of specific pro&#173;cess quality steps, such as the per&#173;for&#173;mance of regular visual field testing in patients with glaucoma, and outcomes, such as incidence of suprachoroidal hemorrhage &#173;after intraocular surgery.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Implementation of a Monitoring System</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An ideal monitoring system would capture data regarding &#173;every patient of interest for a given practitioner. &#173;Doing so would collect the maximum number of cases for statistical analyses and provide maximum statistical power for reliable estimates of uncommon or rare events. In addition, a 100% analy&#173;sis would minimize bias due to missing patients. For example, electronic billing data could identify &#173;every patient who had intraocular surgery (identified by specific Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] codes) in a practice during a specified period and any subsequent surgeries (again identified by CPT codes) within the next 30 or 90 days to determine a specific complication (identified by its International Classification of Diseases code), such as ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment or endophthalmitis. This would reflect <span class="italic">outcome quality</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In contrast, questions about <span class="italic">pro&#173;cess quality</span>—&#173;such as &#173;whether a target pressure range was set for &#173;every patient with glaucoma—&#173;are not amenable to a 100% analy&#173;sis &#173;because that type of data may not be entered in current administrative databases; instead, it may need to be extracted from medical rec&#173;ords by a trained reviewer. Information obtained from billing databases may allow assessment of other pro&#173;cess quality mea&#173;sures, such as gonioscopy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An organ&#173;ization’s next step is to review its rec&#173;ords. What standards should be used for such a review? What criteria should be used? <span class="italic">Explicit</span> criteria, which have a yes/no outcome or limited categories (eg, optic nerve documentation could include a statement regarding the nerve’s condition, the vertical cup–&#173;disc ratio, or a drawing or photo&#173;graph), have higher reliability than <span class="italic">implicit</span> criteria (the reviewer’s judgment that overall quality was good or not good), particularly for interrater reliability. For ophthalmology practices, the American Acad&#173;emy of Ophthalmology (AAO) provides Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines and a summary benchmarks series, both of which can be used to obtain explicit criteria. Similarly, the American Board of Ophthalmology includes explicit criteria in its Practice Improvement Modules for maintenance of board certification. &#173;These are available at <a href="http://www.aao.org/ppp">www.&#173;aao.&#173;org/&#173;ppp</a> and at <a href="https://abop.org">https://&#173;abop.&#173;org</a>, respectively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Rec&#173;ord reviews may reveal that some medical rec&#173;ords are unavailable or are missing data or information on visits. &#173;Every effort should be made to obtain unavailable rec&#173;ords. If &#173;these rec&#173;ords remain unavailable, the number of unavailable rec&#173;ords should be recorded, and replacement rec&#173;ords from the randomization should be reviewed. A high proportion of missing medical rec&#173;ords may suggest bias. For rec&#173;ords with missing visits, it may be pos&#173;si&#173;ble to capture impor&#173;tant data from other available visits. If the review criteria require that &#173;every visit is checked, the options are to (1) exclude that patient, (2) exclude that patient only for analyses needing that missing-&#173;visit data, (3) impute the missing values through statistical modeling of available data, or (4) treat the missing visit as &#173;either meeting or not meeting the criteria (generally the latter). The key steps are to decide what to do and then apply that decision consistently over time (and report the decision with the data and results).</p>
			<p class="body-text">An impor&#173;tant ele&#173;ment of establishing a system for monitoring quality of care is performing power calculations to determine sample sizes, &#173;because &#173;these calculations provide confidence that a nonsignificant difference is truly nonsignificant (and is not due to having an insufficient sample size). <span class="xref-local">See the section “Was the sample large enough to detect a dif</span><span class="xref-local">ference?”</span> earlier in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">One final consideration is the external validity of the method used to determine &#173;whether a quality mea&#173;sure was met. Using chart review, McGlynn and colleagues determined that the rate of annual dilated eye examination among patients with diabetes mellitus was only 19%. But when they used billing codes, they found that the rate was 50%. Was the discrepancy due to poor documentation of the procedure or inaccurate billing practices? The data may have been recorded incorrectly, by &#173;either the observer or the person abstracting the data from the data source. Other errors could be related to coding issues, data entry prob&#173;lems, and incorrect diagnoses. In summary, each discrepancy needs to be examined further, and the &#173;whole monitoring system may need to be redesigned. As stated previously, conducting a pi&#173;lot study with a handful of participants can help with study design, increase validity, and save time when developing a monitoring system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In 2013, AAO introduced its IRIS (Intelligent Research in Sight) Registry, a centralized system for collecting electronic eye care data from ophthalmology practices. This registry automatically abstracts data from modern electronic medical rec&#173;ord systems. In comparison to large claims-&#173;based registries, which collect data about electronic billing, IRIS contains specific information related to the medical treatment of eye disease (eg, visual acuity, IOP) and is agnostic to insurance status. This allows ophthalmologists to examine results of medical treatment of eye disease and develop improvement activities. AAO’s other goals for the registry include the provision of benchmark reports for quality of care and identify opportunities for improvement. The registry can also create large data sets for diseases such as AMD, cataract, and glaucoma, facilitating exploration of trends in treatment, costs, and other &#173;factors. It also allows collection of data regarding rare diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa. For example, Rao and colleagues compared the visual acuity &#173;after 1 year in patients undergoing treatment for neovascular age-&#173;related macular degeneration (nAMD). The researchers found no difference in visual acuity &#173;results when comparing 3 common medi&#173;cations for nAMD (bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept). This result suggested that all medi&#173;cations can be used, and providers may consider other distinguishing characteristics of the treatments such as cost when deciding which medi&#173;cation to recommend. This may be an impor&#173;tant tool to help ophthalmologists continually monitor and improve their per&#173;for&#173;mance quality.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Analy&#173;sis of the Results</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Once the results have been compiled, organ&#173;izations must interpret the data correctly. For proj&#173;ects designed to detect impor&#173;tant deviations from expected per&#173;for&#173;mance, it is impor&#173;tant to use tests that determine statistical significance. For many mea&#173;sures, comparisons of mean per&#173;for&#173;mance are satisfactory—&#173;for example, the percentage of AAO benchmark pro&#173;cess indicators for cataract that providers have achieved. However, for &#173;others, the best way to compare per&#173;for&#173;mance may be to analyze the number of patients whose care meets a given threshold. For example, investigators may want to know the percentage of patients who have at least a 90% quality score. Once that mea&#173;sure is obtained, researchers can compare it among providers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, when evaluating quality results investigators should consider clinical significance and difference, and &#173;factors beyond the provider’s control. Patients could refuse the cost of additional tests or refuse to be dilated &#173;because they need to be able to drive. Outcomes of chronic diseases are even more difficult to evaluate than pro&#173;cess mea&#173;sures such as dilation of a diabetic patient. For example, the rate of blindness from glaucoma over 20&#160;years is subject to the physiologic severity on pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion and the risk for progression among the pool of patients. Quality of care for chronic diseases like glaucoma may be affected by patients’ ability to return for regular care and use their recommended treatments regularly, as well as their socioeconomic status. Thus, mea&#173;sur&#173;ing &#173;whether the provider performs specific examination steps, such as examining the optic nerve (<span class="italic">pro&#173;cess</span>), is appropriate, whereas looking at rates of blindness over 20&#160;years (<span class="italic">outcomes</span>) may not be appropriate.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Organ&#173;izations can use statistical analyses to evaluate potential differences in quality between providers. They can control for patients’ socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics, as well as other &#173;factors that may be related to the outcome of interest. &#173;These analyses may show that a &#173;factor that cannot be “treated” by the provider (eg, socioeconomic status) is the issue and is outside the provider’s control. Even with &#173;these caveats, quality improvement is critical to medicine. In addition, the purpose is not to be punitive but to encourage improvement in all providers and improvement in individual providers from year to year.</p>
			<p class="h2">Methods of Presenting Data to Facilitate Continuous Improvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;After the results have been analyzed, the next step is to graphically display and disseminate them. &#173;There are many ways to pres&#173;ent data. First, the data can be displayed using a frequency distribution such as a histogram (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-8</span>) or using a scatter diagram (<span class="xref-figure">Fig </span><span class="xref-figure">1-9</span>). Are the data <span class="italic">normally distributed</span> (ie, distributed in a bell-&#173;shaped curve), or are they skewed? The answer to this question affects the se&#173;lection of statistical tools and analyses, and it can provide impor&#173;tant insights into potential under&#173;lying &#173;factors. Alternately, 2 distinct subgroups may be found in the data and need to be defined. For example, care in solo practices may differ from care in large single-&#173;specialty groups for a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar disease area.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Second, a Pareto chart (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-10</span>) can provide insights into the cumulative distribution of key &#173;factors of interest. The chart combines a histogram with a cumulative frequency line, making it pos&#173;si&#173;ble to assess per&#173;for&#173;mance across the range of values for the variable of interest.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Third, run charts or control charts (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-11</span>) can help organ&#173;izations understand changes that have occurred over time. Rates of events, especially uncommon ones, can fluctuate. Are the fluctuations significant, both statistically and clinically, compared with &#173;those during prior periods or from other institutions or practices? In run charts and control charts, event rates are plotted over time with both upper and lower control limits and averages. This pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion enables reviewers to determine (1) &#173;whether an aberrant data point is &#173;really a meaningful finding or is due to random error and (2) how the organ&#173;ization is faring compared with peer organ&#173;izations, if data from peers are available.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The purpose of &#173;these data analyses is to identify variation in the &#173;factor of interest. &#173;Factors that are due to the way the system is established and that are inherent in its current state of operations are called <span class="italic">common cause &#173;factors.</span> To improve per&#173;for&#173;mance in this area, the organ&#173;ization &#173;will have to redesign and reengineer the system. For example, &#173;there may be a known rate of “unreliable” visual fields in glaucoma, despite the best training of technicians and screening of patients. In contrast, &#173;there are “special &#173;causes” of variation that are due to a specific, identifiable &#173;factor, often a specific provider or person. Rapid identification of “special cause” variance allows for quick correction of variation that exceeds normal rates. However, improving the per&#173;for&#173;mance of the overall system and reducing the common cause variation &#173;will improve care and affect the most patients. By “shifting the curve,” the organ&#173;ization can improve care for &#173;every patient, as opposed to just identifying the outlier providers and assisting in their rehabilitation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Other Features of Continuous Quality Improvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Studies suggest that just mea&#173;sur&#173;ing and reporting results improves per&#173;for&#173;mance indicators by up to 6%. However, organ&#173;izations that continually incorporate quality improvement activities demonstrate significantly greater per&#173;for&#173;mance gains than organ&#173;izations that do&#160;not.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Use of continuous quality improvement tools requires significant thought regarding how to improve care structures and pro&#173;cesses. An essential step in improving care pro&#173;cesses, before or &#173;after initial analy&#173;sis, is developing a checklist of the steps and parties involved and then creating a flowchart (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-12</span>) of the care system. By examining the overall pro&#173;cess for a specific outcome (eg, making sure a patient with diabetes mellitus gets an annual eye examination), the organ&#173;ization can identify opportunities for improving the pro&#173;cess.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another graphic tool is the fishbone, or cause-&#173;and-&#173;effect, diagram, which maps out the dif&#173;fer&#173;ent &#173;factors that are significant inputs in each step of the care pro&#173;cess, including personnel. Mapping each of &#173;these impor&#173;tant &#173;factors can help clarify where prob&#173;lems may occur and where work may be improved. Changes in &#173;those &#173;factors can then be mea&#173;sured and the results monitored, providing continuous feedback to &#173;those interested in improving the quality of care.</p>
			<p class="h2">Using Lean Techniques to Improve Clinical Practice</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Health care providers are increasingly using an organ&#173;izing framework called <span class="italic">lean</span> to improve patient care and experience. &#173;Toyota uses the lean methodology to produce high-&#173;volume, high-&#173;quality, low-&#173;cost automobiles in an environment with reasonable staffing. &#173;Toyota’s goal is to continually increase its production volume and quality with no additional costs; this goal, implemented with lean techniques, has helped &#173;Toyota to become a dominant car com&#173;pany. What does automobile manufacturing have to do with health care, and specifically, what does it have to do with ophthalmology? As insurance reimbursements decrease and the volume of patients increases, ophthalmologists are tasked with delivering high-&#173;quality care to more patients at the same costs. The lean method may be a useful tool to help ophthalmology practices deliver this outcome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lean is a mind-set and a management toolbox to support the philosophy of delivering the right care at the right time &#173;every time. It focuses on value, in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar in determining, and then delivering, what is of value to the patient (of lesser priority, but still included, is what is of value to the physician and the institution). In other words, first ophthalmologists need to understand their patients’ wants and needs, especially what the patients perceive as “value” gained from their interaction with the ophthalmology clinic. Understanding value provides key information to the goals of: increasing quality, eliminating waste, managing staffing to volume, and reducing time to complete tasks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An example of the implementation of lean techniques in an ophthalmology practice is a glaucoma clinic in an academic center whose patients consistently reported extended wait times. Although the clinicians &#173;were excellent, with high-&#173;quality surgical results and excellent patient reviews, several patients per month reported, both formally and informally, that they waited too long to see the ophthalmic technician and doctors. The clinic’s usual response to such patients included apologizing and explaining that the clinic had suffered unforeseen delays from complicated patients and/or unscheduled emergencies on the day in question. When the clinic realized that &#173;these delays &#173;were occurring too often, management deci&#173;ded to hire more staff members. Although the wait time improved slightly, it continued to be suboptimal; patient complaints continued, and the clinic suffered increased costs. Why did this not work? One reason that the quality of care did not improve was that the “evaluation and treatment procedures” at this clinic did not include a unifying organ&#173;izing framework. In addition, management, rather than frontline workers, deci&#173;ded the action plans.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following year, this clinic implemented a lean methodology to evaluate and improve their clinical practice. Their first step was to define and mea&#173;sure their outcome of interest. They used an electronic medical rec&#173;ord to mea&#173;sure patients’ wait time and discovered that it ranged from 5 to 90 minutes. Their goal was less than 10 minutes! They canceled clinic for a day and called a meeting with all management, providers, and frontline staff to solicit answers to several key lean questions regarding waste, safety, delays, and quality.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Using &#173;these answers, the clinic created “areas of focus,” which had the highest-priority action plans. &#173;These action plans included structured daily huddles with staff at the beginning of clinic to discuss equipment prob&#173;lems, scheduling issues, missing charts, and recent quality or safety issues; at the end of the huddle, they allotted time for open discussion of any other issues. The clinic also created standardized work for each member of the team, eliminated paper printouts of schedules and patient face sheets, loaded rooms in the same order to create the same physician and patient movement, and removed any extra work that provided no value. &#173;Because lean represents “continual improvement,” each day the pro&#173;cess is reevaluated, and yearly, the staff holds a kaizen evaluation meeting with dif&#173;fer&#173;ent areas of focus. If improvements do not work, the clinic evaluates &#173;these failures. Over a 5-&#173;year period, with the same amount of staff, clinic visits increased 20%; revenues increased 50%; patient delays decreased 80%; staff satisfaction soared; and patients expressed their satisfaction to the clinic on a daily basis. Overall, this example suggests that lean may be a useful method for ophthalmology clinics to “work smarter, not harder” to improve value, give the highest quality of care, and provide exceptional ser&#173;vice with the same or decreased resources.</p>

			<p class="h2">Summary</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Efforts to improve the quality of care—&#173;and ensure that fair and meaningful quality mea&#173;sures are part of this endeavor—&#173;bring key statistical concepts to the forefront. &#173;Because of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA), ophthalmologist reimbursements &#173;will be more associated with quality and improvement (eg, Merit-&#173;based Incentive Payment System [MIPS]) and eligible alternative payment models (APMs). Indeed, insurance companies are already selecting providers that have documented higher quality and lower cost for participation in insurance com&#173;pany provider panels. Thus, clinical research and statistics are useful not only for understanding the scientific lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture and providing care for patients, but also for influencing the practices and livelihoods of providers, including ophthalmologists.</p>
