			<p class="h1">Ischemic Heart Disease</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Atherosclerotic CHD is by far the number-&#173;one killer not only in the United States but also in the world. In the United States, it is estimated that 1 person dies of CHD &#173;every minute. The number of &#173;women who die of CHD is 10 times that of &#173;women who die of breast cancer.</p>
			<p class="h2">Pathophysiology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Abnormal cholesterol intake and metabolism leading to atherosclerosis are central &#173;factors in the development of ischemic heart disease (IHD). The “fatty streak,” an early sign of atherosclerosis, is an accumulation of lipids and lipid-&#173;laden macrophages, called <span class="italic">foam cells</span>, &#173;under the endothelium of the coronary arteries. &#173;These cells or&#173;ga&#173;nize into a plaque, and as the plaque becomes calcified, the lumen of the vessel narrows. The plaque can also become unstable and rupture, leading to turbulence and activation of the coagulation cascade and, ultimately, to intravascular thrombosis. The result is partial or complete vessel occlusion, which &#173;causes the symptoms of unstable angina or MI.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Ischemia</span> is defined as local, temporary oxygen deprivation associated with inadequate removal of metabolites due to reduced tissue perfusion. IHD is typically caused by decreased perfusion of the myocardium secondary to stenotic or obstructed coronary arteries. The balance between arterial supply of and myo&#173;car&#173;dial demand for oxygen determines &#173;whether ischemia occurs. Significant coronary stenosis, thrombosis, occlusion, reduced arterial pressure, hypoxemia, or severe anemia can impede the supply of oxygen to the myocardium. On the demand side, an increase in heart rate, ventricular contractility, or wall tension (which is determined by systolic arterial pressure, ventricular volume, and ventricular wall thickness) may increase utilization of oxygen. When the demand for oxygen exceeds the supply, ischemia occurs. If the ischemia is prolonged, infarction and myo&#173;car&#173;dial necrosis result. The necrotic pro&#173;cess begins in the subendocardium, usually &#173;after approximately 20 minutes of coronary obstruction, and progresses to transmural and complete infarction in 4–6 hours.</p>
			<p class="h2">Risk &#173;Factors for Coronary Heart Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The majority of patients with CHD have identifiable risk &#173;factors. Epidemiologic studies have implicated a positive &#173;family history, male sex, lipid abnormalities, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, physical inactivity, short sleep duration, obesity, and smoking as risk &#173;factors. Many of &#173;these &#173;factors are modifiable; see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span> for a more detailed discussion on how to reduce risk. Markers of inflammation, particularly high-&#173;sensitivity C-&#173;reactive protein (CRP), may also represent strong risk &#173;factors for CHD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CHD is the leading cause of death in &#173;women, accounting for one-&#173;third of all deaths, and kills more &#173;women than men each year. The average lifetime risk of CHD in &#173;women is very high, nearly 1&#160;in 2. Compared with a man of the same age, a 50-&#173;year-&#173;old &#173;woman with a single additional risk &#173;factor has a substantially higher lifetime risk for CHD. Fortunately, most CHD risk in &#173;women is modifiable with the recommendations previously discussed; optimizing modifiable risk is of crucial importance in &#173;women.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, postmenopausal &#173;women are disproportionately affected by a stress-&#173;induced cardiomyopathy called <span class="italic">takotsubo cardiomyopathy</span>, or broken-&#173;heart syndrome. This disorder may mimic an acute MI, but testing reveals no occlusive vascular disease. The etiology is unclear.</p>
			<p class="h2">Clinical Syndromes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions of CHD include angina pectoris (ie, stable angina and variant, or Prinzmetal, angina), the acute coronary syndromes (ie, unstable angina, acute MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), sudden cardiac death, and asymptomatic CHD.</p>
			<p class="h3">Angina pectoris</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cardinal symptom in patients with CHD is <span class="italic">angina pectoris</span>. It is usually manifested as precordial chest pain or tightness that is often triggered by physical exertion, emotional distress, or eating. Angina pectoris is usually due to atherosclerotic heart disease. Coronary vasospasm may occur at the site of a lesion or even in other&#173;wise normal coronary arteries. Angina typically lasts 5–10 minutes and is usually relieved by rest, nitroglycerin, or both. Patients may pres&#173;ent with pain radiating into other areas, including the jaw, arm, neck, shoulder, back, chest wall, or abdomen.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Often, angina is misinterpreted as indigestion or musculoskeletal pain. The level of physical activity that results in angina pectoris is clinically significant and is useful in determining the severity of CHD, as well as its treatment and prognosis. &#173;Because myo&#173;car&#173;dial ischemia may be painless in diabetic patients and in &#173;women, the diagnosis is often delayed in &#173;these patients &#173;until the disease is more advanced. The pain associated with myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction is similar to that of angina but is usually more severe and more prolonged.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-4"><span class="h4-head">Stable angina pectoris</span> Angina is considered stable if it responds to rest or nitroglycerin and if the patterns of frequency, ease of onset, duration, and response to medi&#173;cation have not changed substantially over 3 months.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-4"><span class="h4-head">Variant (Prinzmetal) angina</span> Variant angina occurs at rest and is not related to physical exertion. The ST segment is elevated on electrocardiography during the anginal episodes, which are caused by coronary artery spasm. Under&#173;lying atherosclerosis is pres&#173;ent in 60%–80% of cases, and thrombosis and occlusion may result during the episodes of coronary artery spasm.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Acute coronary syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)</span> comprises the spectrum of unstable cardiac ischemia, from unstable angina to acute MI. Plaque rupture is considered the common under&#173;lying event. Unstable angina and acute MI should be considered closely related events, clinically differentiated by the presence or absence of markers of myo&#173;car&#173;dial injury. In 2007, a task force representing groups from the United States and Eu&#173;rope established a definition of MI; it includes the detection of cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin), ischemia symptoms, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicating new ischemia, pathologic Q waves on ECG, and evidence of loss of &#173;viable myocardium or wall-&#173;motion abnormalities on imaging.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If an occlusive coronary thrombus persists, MI can result. The location and extent of the infarction depend on the anatomical distribution of the occluded vessel, the presence of additional stenotic lesions, and the adequacy of collateral circulation. If the patient has chest pain at rest, unstable angina is the diagnosis. If the ischemia is severe enough to cause myo&#173;car&#173;dial necrosis, infarction results. <span class="italic">Acute MI</span> is further differentiated into <span class="italic">non–&#173;ST-&#173;segment elevation MI (NSTEMI)</span> and <span class="italic">ST-&#173;segment elevation MI (STEMI).</span> Typical findings used to differentiate between &#173;these include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-6"><span class="italic">Unstable angina (chest pain at rest).</span> The ECG shows ST-&#173;segment depression and/or T-&#173;wave inversion. No cardiac biomarkers are detected, indicating the absence of myo&#173;car&#173;dial necrosis.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">NSTEMI (subendocardial, nontransmural).</span> The ECG shows ST-&#173;segment depression and/or T-&#173;wave inversion. Cardiac biomarkers are pres&#173;ent. The MI may be considered incomplete; thus, patients may be more susceptible to reinfarction or extension. &#173;Aggressive workup and treatment are required to prevent progression to STEMI.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">STEMI.</span> The ECG shows early ST-&#173;segment elevation (Figs 5-1, 5-2) and &#173;later Q waves. This condition involves full-&#173;thickness or nearly full-&#173;thickness necrosis of the ventricular wall. If the necrosis has not yet involved the full thickness of the ventricular wall, early reperfusion therapy is required to avoid progression to full-&#173;thickness necrosis.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction may occur suddenly, without warning, in a previously asymptomatic patient or in a patient with stable or variant angina; MI may also follow a period of unstable angina. Patients commonly experience chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, weakness, anxiety, dyspnea, lightheadedness, and palpitations. However, nearly 25% of myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarcts are painless. Symptoms may begin during or &#173;after exertion or at rest.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical findings in MI vary and depend on the location and severity of the is&#173;chemia or injury. Approximately half of all infarctions involve the inferior myo&#173;car&#173;dial wall, and most of the remaining half involve the anterior regions. Examination may reveal pallor, coolness of the extremities, low-&#173;grade fever, signs of pulmonary congestion and increased central venous pressure (if left ventricular dysfunction is pres&#173;ent), an S<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> or S<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> gallop, an apical systolic murmur (caused by papillary muscle dysfunction), hypertension, or hypotension. The ECG may demonstrate a variety of ST-&#173;segment and T-&#173;wave changes and arrhythmias.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Approximately 60% of patients who die of cardiac disease die suddenly, before reaching the hospital. However, the prognosis for patients hospitalized with MI has become remarkably good. Some studies in which thrombolytic therapy or PCI was used reported a mortality rate in the range of 5%–8%. Mortality is affected by a wide variety of &#173;factors, such as the degree of heart failure, extent of myo&#173;car&#173;dial damage, severity of the under&#173;lying atherosclerotic pro&#173;cess, heart size, and previous ischemia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Immediate coronary angiography and primary PCI (including stenting) of the infarct-&#173;involved artery have been shown to be superior to thrombolysis when done promptly by experienced operators in high-&#173;volume centers. If the time from first medical contact to intervention (“door to balloon” time) is kept &#173;under 90 minutes, the outcome is improved and is superior to that of thrombolysis. This intervention, in conjunction with antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, is widely used in patients with acute MI.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The complications of MI depend on its severity and may include CHF (see the section Congestive Heart Failure), rupture of the ventricular wall, pericarditis, and arrhythmias. Regional and global ventricular contractile dysfunction may result in CHF or pulmonary edema. Mild to moderate heart failure occurs in nearly 50% of patients following MI. Some patients experience post-&#173;MI pericarditis, characterized by a pericardial friction rub 2–3 days &#173;after infarction. Injury along the conduction pathways of the atria or ventricles may lead to bradycardia, heart block, supraventricular tachycardias, or ventricular arrhythmias. Arrhythmias often exacerbate ischemic injury by reducing the perfusion pressure in the coronary arteries. Most acute deaths from MI are caused by arrhythmia.</p>

Fourth universal definition of myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction (2018). <span class="reference--journal--single_italic">J Am Coll Cardiol.</span> 2018;72(18):2231–2264.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Sudden cardiac death</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Sudden cardiac death (SCD)</span> is defined as unexpected, nontraumatic death that occurs within 1 hour &#173;after onset of symptoms in clinically stable individuals. A disproportionate number of SCDs take place in the early morning hours. SCD is usually caused by a severe arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, profound bradycardia, or asystole. SCD may result from MI, occur during an episode of angina, or strike without warning in a patient with frequent arrhythmias secondary to under&#173;lying IHD or ventricular dysfunction. Other &#173;causes of SCD are Wolff-&#173;Parkinson-&#173;White syndrome, long QT syndrome, torsades de pointes, atrioventricular block, aortic stenosis, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, ruptured or dissecting aortic aneurysm, and pulmonary embolism. An implantable cardioverter-&#173;defibrillator (ICD) is recommended for patients who have survived a cardiac arrest or an episode of hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia and for patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction &#173;after MI.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Asymptomatic ischemic heart disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Asymptomatic patients with CHD are at par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar risk for unexpected MI, life-&#173;threatening arrhythmias, and SCD. Advanced CHD may develop in &#173;these patients, and they may experience multiple infarcts before the correct diagnosis is made and appropriate treatment is initiated. Older adults, &#173;women, and individuals with diabetes mellitus are more likely to have painless ischemia. Approximately 25% of MIs are asymptomatic, but they may be detected on a subsequent ECG. A patient who has unexplained dyspnea, weakness, arrhythmias, or poor exercise tolerance requires cardiac testing to evaluate for the presence of undiagnosed CHD.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Noninvasive Cardiac Diagnostic Procedures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Noninvasive diagnostic testing for patients with CHD includes electrocardiography, serum biomarker mea&#173;sure&#173;ments, echocardiography, vari&#173;ous types of stress testing, and imaging studies. Assessment of cardiac risk using vari&#173;ous mea&#173;sures (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span>&#160;in this volume) &#173;will identify &#173;those patients most likely to benefit from testing.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Electrocardiography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ECG may appear normal between episodes of ischemia in patients with angina. During angina, the ST segments often become elevated or depressed by up to 5&#160;mm. T waves may be inverted, they may become tall and peaked, or inverted T waves may normalize. &#173;These ECG findings, when associated with characteristic anginal pain, are virtually diagnostic of IHD. However, absence of ECG changes does not definitively exclude myo&#173;car&#173;dial ischemia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">During myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction, QT-&#173;interval prolongation and peaked T waves may &#173;appear. The ST segments may be depressed or elevated (see Fig 5-2). ST-&#173;segment elevation may persist for several days to weeks before returning to normal. T-&#173;wave inversion appears in the leads corresponding to the site of the infarct. Q waves or a reduction in the QRS amplitude appears with the onset of myo&#173;car&#173;dial necrosis. Q waves are typically absent in a subendocardial (nontransmural) infarction. Tachycardia and ventricular arrhythmias are most common within the first few hours &#173;after the onset of infarction. Bradyarrhythmias, such as heart block, are more common with inferior infarction; ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation are more common with anteroseptal infarction.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Serum biomarker testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Cardiac enzymes</span> are released into the bloodstream when myo&#173;car&#173;dial necrosis occurs and, therefore, are valuable in differentiating MI from unstable angina and noncardiac &#173;causes of chest pain. With the advent of assays for cardiac-&#173;specific troponins, serum biomarker testing has also proved useful in identifying patients with ACS who are at greatest risk for adverse outcomes.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cardiac-&#173;specific troponins</span> are accepted as the most sensitive and specific biochemical cardiac markers in ACS. Cardiac isoforms of troponins (troponins T and I) are impor&#173;tant regulatory ele&#173;ments in myo&#173;car&#173;dial cells and, unlike creatine kinase MB (CK-&#173;MB), are not normally pres&#173;ent in the serum of healthy individuals. Moreover, unlike CK-&#173;MB levels, troponin levels are not elevated in patients with skeletal muscle injury. Troponins T and I have been shown to be more cardiac-&#173;specific and cardiac-&#173;sensitive than CK-&#173;MB, allowing for more accurate diagnosis of cardiac injury. Troponin levels remain elevated from 3&#160;hours to 14 days &#173;after MI. Mildly elevated troponin levels may be found in patients with NSTEMI who other&#173;wise would be considered to have unstable angina. Troponin levels are elevated &#173;after MI, but they may also be elevated in patients with myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to being diagnostically valuable, troponin levels provide prognostic &#173;information. Patients with an ACS who pres&#173;ent with elevated troponin levels have an increased risk of CHF, cardiogenic shock, death, recurrent nonfatal infarction, and need for revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG, discussed &#173;later in this chapter). Fi&#173;nally, a quantitative relationship has been demonstrated between the peak amount of troponin mea&#173;sured and the risk of death in patients who pres&#173;ent with ACS. Patients who are at greatest risk for adverse outcomes can be identified in the emergency department, allowing for more appropriate medical decisions and therapeutic triage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Serum myoglobin is the first marker to rise following myo&#173;car&#173;dial damage, and levels can be elevated between 1 and 20 hours &#173;after infarction. Although myoglobin might appear to be ideal for early detection of MI, its per&#173;for&#173;mance is not consistent and its specificity for cardiac events is poor. The cardiac-&#173;specific troponins remain the optimal biomarker test in the setting of ACS.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Echocardiography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Echocardiography employs 1-&#173; and 2-&#173;dimensional ultrasound and color flow Doppler techniques to image the ventricles and atria, the heart valves, left ventricular contraction and wall-&#173;motion abnormalities, left ventricular ejection fraction, and the pericardium. Patients with IHD, particularly following infarction, commonly have regional wall-&#173;motion abnormalities that correspond to the areas of myo&#173;car&#173;dial injury. Other, less frequent complications of infarction, such as mitral regurgitation from papillary muscle injury, ventricular septal defect, ventricular aneurysm, ventricular thrombus, and pericardial effusion, can also be detected with echocardiography. Color flow Doppler imaging provides information on the flow of blood across abnormal valves, pressure differences within the chambers, intracardiac shunts, and cardiac output. However, cardiac biomarkers are far more sensitive and specific than echocardiography in detecting cardiac injury.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Stress echocardiography</span> (exercise echocardiography) is useful for imaging cardiac-&#173;valve and wall-&#173;motion abnormalities and ventricular dysfunction induced by ischemia during exercise or &#173;after pharmacologic challenge. Predischarge exercise stress echocardio&#173;graphy provides useful prognostic information following acute MI.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Exercise stress testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with angina may have normal findings on clinical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography between episodes of ischemia. Standardized exercise tests have been developed to induce myo&#173;car&#173;dial ischemia &#173;under controlled conditions. The ECG, heart rate, blood pressure, and general physical status of the patient are monitored during the procedure. The endpoint in angina patients is a symptom or sign of cardiac ischemia, such as chest pain, dyspnea, ST-&#173;segment depression, arrhythmia, or hypotension. A modified exercise stress test can also be performed in patients with a recent MI to help determine functional status and prognosis. Stress testing is useful both in establishing the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease and in assessing its severity.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Radionuclide scintigraphy and scans</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Radionuclide techniques can be used to increase the sensitivity of exercise testing. Left ventricular dysfunction can result from necrotic tissue, myo&#173;car&#173;dial hibernation &#173;after injury, or myo&#173;car&#173;dial stunning. Approximately 20%–40% of patients with left ventricular dysfunction on echo or stress testing still have &#173;viable myo&#173;car&#173;dial tissue, which may improve with reperfusion. Several agents are available for injection during testing, including thallium-201, technetium-99m (Tc99m) sestamibi, and technetium-99m tetrofosmin.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thallium accumulates in healthy myocardium and reveals a perfusion defect in areas of myo&#173;car&#173;dial ischemia. Thallium scans have a high sensitivity and specificity for CHD. Reversible thallium or Tc99m sestamibi defects are &#173;those that are pres&#173;ent during exercise but resolve during rest. This correlates with myo&#173;car&#173;dial ischemia. In contrast, a fixed thallium or Tc99m defect is pres&#173;ent during both exercise and rest and represents a region of prior infarction or nonviable tissue. For patients unable to exercise vigorously enough to reach the required heart rates during the exercise stress test, a thallium scan or echocardiogram in conjunction with a pharmacologic stress test may provide information similar to that of an exercise examination. Tomographic imaging of myo&#173;car&#173;dial perfusion is pos&#173;si&#173;ble with thallium-201 or Tc99m via a technique called <span class="italic">single-&#173;photon emission computed tomography (SPECT),</span> which provides better imaging of infarcts, enhanced detection of multivessel disease, and fewer artifacts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other imaging technologies that may add clinically useful information include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-6"><span class="italic">Positron emission tomography,</span> which differentiates metabolically active myocardium from scar tissue.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Coronary CT angiography,</span> which is useful in evaluating occlusive vascular disease and ruling out atherosclerotic disease.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Electron beam CT;</span> this quantifies coronary artery calcification, which correlates with atherosclerosis and is highly sensitive but not specific. It may be an alternative to angiography in some patients.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3"><span class="italic">Cardiac MRI,</span> which provides excellent imaging, and perfusion testing with gadolinium. MRI may be contraindicated in some patients with ICDs or pacemakers, but it can be safely used in the presence of coronary stents. Cardiac CT and MRI are also useful in assessing congenital or acquired coronary abnormalities.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Invasive Cardiac Diagnostic Procedures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Coronary arteriography</span> and <span class="italic">ventriculography</span> provide valuable information about the presence and severity of CHD and about ventricular function. &#173;These techniques can indicate the specific areas of coronary artery stenosis or occlusion, the number of involved vessels, the ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes, the ejection fraction, and regional wall-&#173;motion abnormalities. <span class="italic">Multiple gated acquisition (MUGA)</span> scans can also be performed for &#173;these purposes. This information helps the cardiologist and cardiac surgeon plan appropriate treatment for the patient. <span class="italic">Intravascular ultrasound imaging</span> is an evolving invasive modality for studying the intraluminal coronary anatomy and may be particularly useful in evaluating the effects of stents or angioplasty.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Coronary artery stenosis is hemodynamically significant when the arterial lumen dia&#173;meter is narrowed by more than 50%, or the cross-&#173;sectional area is reduced by more than 75%. Common indications for coronary arteriography are ACS, post-&#173;MI angina, stable angina unresponsive to medical therapy or revascularization, a markedly positive exercise stress test result, and a recent MI in a patient younger than 40&#160;years. The technique may also be useful in evaluating valvular heart disease, ventricular septal defect, papillary muscle dysfunction, cardiomyopathy of unknown cause, or unexplained ventricular arrhythmias.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Management of Ischemic Heart Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goals of disease management for the patient with CHD are to reduce the frequency of or eliminate angina, prevent myo&#173;car&#173;dial damage, and prolong life. The first line of attack should include eliminating or reducing risk &#173;factors for atherosclerosis. Smoking cessation, dietary modification, weight loss, exercise, and improved control of diabetes mellitus and hypertension are critical steps. Fraker and colleagues have reported regression of atherosclerotic lesions following intensive lipid-&#173;lowering therapy; and, &#173;unless contraindicated, statins are recommended for all CHD patients. Antiplatelet therapy with low-&#173;dose daily aspirin has also been advocated for all patients with CHD &#173;because it significantly reduces the risk of MI.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aspirin appears to offer equal benefit to &#173;women and men in reducing primary MI risk, and it is also useful in secondary prevention. Aspirin may also help protect against stroke; however, in low-&#173;risk patients, the risk of bleeding complications may outweigh the benefits. Aspirin use should be guided by an assessment of the patient’s risk of stroke or MI. Hormone therapy, antioxidant vitamin supplementation, and folic acid therapy do not appear to provide any benefit in preventing CVD.</p>
			<p class="h3">Antithrombotic agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prevention of stroke, heart attack, and numerous other thromboembolic diseases requires selective inhibition of the hemostasis pro&#173;cess. Numerous products have been developed to inhibit platelet aggregation or block specific steps in the coagulation cascade (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 5-3</span>), including several oral agents, which are frequently used in the outpatient setting (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;5-1</span>). &#173;Those drugs requiring intravenous or subcutaneous injection are predominantly used in an inpatient setting (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;5-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Treatment of stable angina pectoris</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Medical management of angina pectoris is designed to deliver as much oxygen as pos&#173;si&#173;ble to the potentially ischemic myocardium, to decrease the oxygen demand to a level at which symptoms are eliminated or reduced to a comfortable level, or both.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Therapeutic agents include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="greek_italic">b</span><span class="italic">-&#173;Adrenergic blockers.</span> Also called <span class="greek_italic">b</span><span class="italic">-&#173;blockers</span>, &#173;these drugs represent the first line of treatment. They reduce heart rate and contractility (decreasing oxygen demand) and are demonstrated to prolong life in CHD patients. They should be avoided in patients with Prinzmetal angina.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Slow calcium channel blockers</span>. &#173;These agents, including diltiazem, verapamil, and amlodipine, are useful for long-&#173;term angina treatment. They should be used with caution in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Nitrates and nitroglycerin.</span> &#173;These agents increase oxygen delivery through coronary vasodilation. Systemic effects (eg, venous dilation, reduction in blood pressure) decrease oxygen demand. They should be used with caution in patients taking erectile dysfunction drugs.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Aspirin with or without clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor.</span> &#173;These drugs can be used for anticoagulation. The regimen of aspirin plus 1 of &#173;these other drugs is called <span class="italic">dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT).</span></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">Statins. Statins</span> are recommended for use in virtually all ACS patients, regardless of serum lipid levels, if not contraindicated.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Improving the oxygen-&#173;carrying capacity of the blood by treating anemia or coexisting pulmonary disease provides some additional benefit. Patients in whom medical therapy is unsuccessful may be candidates for revascularization procedures.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Revascularization</span> Procedures for revascularization include <span class="italic">percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)</span> with or without stenting or <span class="italic">coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)</span>. &#173;These approaches may improve coronary blood flow, control angina, and increase exercise tolerance. In high-&#173;risk patients, the risk of infarction is reduced, and long-&#173;term survival is enhanced. Revascularization is indicated in other&#173;wise healthy patients with advanced left main coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction with 3-&#173;vessel disease, or angina that is not adequately controlled with medical treatment. &#173;Either PCI or CABG is &#173;effective for relieving angina; however, CABG is superior to PCI in terms of survival for some patients who have significant areas of at-&#173;risk myocardium or substantial left ventricular dysfunction. Recently, some authors have questioned &#173;whether PCI is superior to maximal medical therapy in the treatment of stable angina.</p>
			<p class="body-text">PCI was developed as an alternative to surgical revascularization. One PCI technique, <span class="italic">angioplasty,</span> involves passing a balloon catheter into a stenosed vessel and inflating the balloon at the site of the narrowing to widen the lumen. Although 85%–90% of vessels can be opened with PCI, the rate of restenosis is approximately 25%–40% at 6 months. The insertion of a wire-&#173;mesh <span class="italic">stent</span> at the time of PCI improves patency and reduces the risk of &#173;restenosis by nearly 50%. Drug-&#173;eluting stents are superior to bare-&#173;metal stents in preventing restenosis but are also more likely to lead to late stent thrombosis. Stent thrombosis may result in MI or death, so patients receiving stents should be given aggressive anticoagulation at the time of placement. Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean and US guidelines for anticoagulant use during stent placement are similar. DAT (aspirin plus clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) should continue for at least 1 month &#173;after stenting for a bare-&#173;metal stent and 6–12 months for a drug-&#173;eluting stent. DAT should not be stopped during this period, and elective surgery should be postponed &#173;unless the patient is able to continue on DAT. Patients intolerant of aspirin may use clopidogrel alone.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When angioplasty is inappropriate or in&#173;effec&#173;tive and medical therapy has failed to control symptoms in patients with severe multivessel disease, CABG may be considered. CABG may be indicated in patients with high-&#173;risk disease, including &#173;those with significant left main, proximal left anterior descending, or 3-&#173;vessel disease, especially if accompanied by left ventricular dysfunction. During CABG, a shunt is installed from the aorta to the diseased coronary artery to bypass the area of obstruction and increase blood flow. CABG has been shown to increase left ventricular function, improve quality of life, relieve angina, and, often, reduce the risk of infarction and cardiac death. Some patients now receive “off-&#173;pump bypass surgery,” in which the grafts are sewn onto the beating heart. This technique decreases the risk of adverse effects of cardiopulmonary bypass, which include memory, cognitive, and other neurologic deficits.</p>
			<p class="body-text">PCI and CABG have similar mortality rates; but patients undergoing PCI are more likely to require a second procedure, and CABG has better long-&#173;term survival outcomes than PCI in most studies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although revascularization may produce good outcomes, the under&#173;lying disease pro&#173;cess requires ongoing management. The Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation demonstrated that even &#173;after PCI or CABG, arterial disease &#173;will continue to pro&#173;gress &#173;unless cardiac risk &#173;factors are reduced. Optimal medical management is also required.</p>

They are initially treated aggressively with anti-&#173;ischemic pharmacotherapy. Once &#173;these initial mea&#173;sures are instituted, further management and triage of patients with an ACS are based on the presence or absence of ST-&#173;segment elevation. Patients with ST-&#173;segment elevation undergo reperfusion therapy with thrombolysis, CABG, or catheter-&#173;based interventions; patients with non–&#173;ST-&#173;segment elevation may be managed with medical treatment alone or a more aggressive interventional approach. The use of a risk calculator (eg, TIMI, GRACE, PURSUIT) may help identify high-&#173;risk patients and determine subsequent management; the TIMI and GRACE risk calculators are available at <a href="http://www.timi.org/index.php?page=calculators">www.&#173;timi.&#173;org/&#173;index.&#173;php?&#173;page<span class="symbol">=&#173;</span>calculators</a> and <a href="http://www.mdcalc.com/grace-acs-risk-mortality-calculator">www.&#173;mdcalc.&#173;com/&#173;grace-&#173;acs-&#173;risk-&#173;mortality-&#173;calculator</a>, respectively.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">CHF and pulmonary edema should be treated if pres&#173;ent. If <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-&#173;blockers cannot be used, the clinician may consider verapamil or diltiazem. ACE inhibitors decrease the risk of death if given within 24 hours of MI, but they should be avoided in patients with hypotension or renal insufficiency.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Anticoagulant therapy</span> is beneficial in ACS. It involves a variety of agents, including unfractionated heparin; low-&#173;molecular-&#173;weight heparins; direct thrombin inhibitors; and &#173;factor Xa inhibitors (see &#173;Table&#160;5-1). Choice of the optimal regimen depends on what other medi&#173;cations are being used and &#173;whether the treatment strategy is conservative or interventional. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are of limited use in patients with NSTEMI, although they may be tried if other agents have failed to provide sufficient anticoagulation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once unstable angina and NSTEMI have been managed as described, patients may be treated with &#173;either a conservative noninvasive approach or an early invasive (angiographic) strategy, depending on their level of risk for adverse outcomes. Controlled &#173;trials have shown the superiority of an invasive approach in managing ACS patients, particularly &#173;those who have refractory angina, hemodynamic instability, or elevated risk as mea&#173;sured by bedside risk stratification tools (eg, TIMI, GRACE). The decision to proceed from diagnostic angiography to revascularization (PCI or CABG) is influenced not only by the coronary anatomy but also by several other &#173;factors, including anticipated life expectancy, ventricular function, comorbidity, functional capacity, severity of symptoms, and quantity of &#173;viable myocardium at risk. Fibrinolysis should <span class="italic">not</span> be performed on patients with unstable angina or NSTEMI.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Management of ST-&#173;segment elevation ACS</span> Current therapy for evolving Q-&#173;wave MI involves rapid and effective reperfusion &#173;because necrosis is a time-&#173;dependent pro&#173;cess. Optimal myo&#173;car&#173;dial salvage requires nearly complete reperfusion as soon as pos&#173;si&#173;ble: reperfusion within 1 hour of symptom onset yields maximal benefit. The benefit of reperfusion therapy 12 hours &#173;after symptom onset has not been established.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Methods of reperfusion include thrombolysis and catheter-&#173;based PCIs (balloon angioplasty with or without stent placement). Numerous clinical &#173;trials have shown the superiority of early PCI over thrombolysis, particularly if performed in the first 90 minutes following medical contact. Hospitals without PCI capability should transfer the patient to a fa&#173;cil&#173;i&#173;ty that can perform PCI if the procedure can be done within 120 minutes &#173;after first medical contact. Other&#173;wise, thrombolytic therapy should be started within 30 minutes of first medical contact. PCI following full-&#173;dose thrombolytics carries significant risks but may be done in high-&#173;risk patients or if thrombolytic therapy has failed (“rescue PCI”). Totally occluded arteries generally do not benefit from PCI.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CABG may be considered if PCI or fibrinolysis fails, but the potential benefits must be weighed against an increased mortality risk in the first 3–7 days &#173;after STEMI.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Initial medical management before and &#173;after reperfusion therapy should include &#173;aspirin, clopidogrel, morphine (for pain), nitrates, statins, and <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-&#173;blockers if &#173;there are no contraindications. Except for aspirin, nonsteroidal agents should not be used acutely or during hospitalization, &#173;because they increase the risk of CHF and death. Other adjuncts to therapy may include low-&#173;molecular-&#173;weight heparins and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, particularly if PCI is anticipated.</p>

			<p class="h1">Congestive Heart Failure</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The epidemiologic magnitude of CHF is staggering. Approximately 5 million patients in the United States have CHF, and &#173;there are 500,000 new cases per year. It is estimated that CHF &#173;will develop in 20% of the population older than 40&#160;years. Many patients who consult an ophthalmologist belong to the older age group that is particularly prone to this condition. Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot meet the metabolic demands of the tissues. The cardiac pump itself may be failing, or it may be nearly normal but unable to keep up with demand. The direct result of heart failure is circulatory failure.</p>
			<p class="h2">Classification</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Heart failure is classified into 4 stages, including stages for patients at risk for heart failure and &#173;those without current signs or symptoms (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 5-4</span>). Symptomatic heart failure is subdivided according to <span class="italic">ejection fraction (EF),</span> which is the calculated proportion of blood ejected by the ventricle during a single or average contraction. The EF is more than 50% in an average person without HF. A left ventricular EF less than or equal to 40% is classified as <span class="italic">heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF),</span> and a patient in heart failure with an EF greater than 50% is classified as <span class="italic">heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).</span> HFrEF is sometimes called left-&#173;sided, or systolic heart, failure, and HFpEF as right-&#173;sided, or diastolic, heart failure. Approximately two-&#173;thirds of all CHF is HFrEF, but HFpEF is more common in &#173;women.</p>
			<p class="h2">Symptoms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although heart failure may be asymptomatic in its earliest stages, a variety of symptoms may develop, depending on the severity of ventricular dysfunction. Symptoms may result from inadequate tissue perfusion caused by pump failure or from the failing heart’s inability to empty adequately, leading to edema and fluid accumulation in the lungs, extremities, and other sites. The most frequent symptoms of left ventricular failure are dyspnea with exertion or at rest, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, diaphoresis, generalized weakness, fatigue, anxiety, and lightheadedness. With more severe CHF, the patient may also experience a productive cough; copious pink, frothy sputum; and confusion. Angina may also occur if the CHF results from ischemia. Right-&#173;sided heart failure may occur separately from or secondary to chronic left-&#173;sided heart failure. Peripheral edema typically develops in patients with right-&#173;sided heart failure.</p>
			<p class="h2">Clinical Signs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Examination findings in acute left ventricular failure may include respiratory distress, use of the respiratory accessory muscles, pinkish sputum or frank hemoptysis, coarse rales on pulmonary auscultation, expiratory wheezes, a rapid heart rate, an S gallop, diaphoresis, and deterioration in &#173;mental status. Blood pressure is often markedly elevated but may be reduced during MI. Long-&#173;standing cases of CHF show signs of right ventricular failure, especially elevated central venous pressure, pedal edema, hepatomegaly, and cyanosis. In some patients, pleural effusion or ascites may be detected.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnostic Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The history and clinical examination are the most impor&#173;tant components in the diagnosis of CHF. Diagnostic studies that are helpful in evaluating CHF and its under&#173;lying &#173;causes include echocardiography, chest radiography, electrocardiography, blood gas analy&#173;sis, complete blood counts, serum electrolyte tests, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine tests, liver function tests, and urinalysis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Echocardiography is critically impor&#173;tant in identifying the many cardiac &#173;causes and comorbidities of CHF (eg, IHD, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, cardiac arrhythmias) and mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the left ventricular EF. Although the EF can also be mea&#173;sured by radionuclide ventriculography or contrast ventriculography, echocardiography is the most useful and least invasive method for determining and sequentially following EF and the systolic state of the ventricles. Mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the EF allows the clinician to differentiate between HFrEF and HFpEF, a distinction that is of paramount significance in managing the CHF patient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or its metabolite (NT-&#173;proBNP), a peptide associated with reduced left ventricular EF and increased left ventricular filling pressure, may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of CHF, assessing its severity and prognosis, and guiding the treatment. BNP may also be useful as a screening tool to identify early CHF or prevent its development. If the primary mechanism of heart failure is unclear, additional tests may prove useful in selected patients. Such tests may include exercise stress testing, cardiac nuclear imaging studies, right-&#173;sided and/or left-&#173;sided heart catheterization, Holter monitoring, pulmonary function tests, HIV testing, and thyroid function tests. Coronary angiography can be helpful in identifying patients with ongoing cardiac ischemia and CHF, for which revascularization may lead to symptomatic improvement.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ECG may reveal acute ischemic changes, acute or previous ventricular hypertrophy, chamber enlargement, and atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias. Typical chest radiograph findings are prominent pulmonary vessels, interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, and pleural effusions. Patients with severe pump failure may have abnormal serum electrolyte levels owing to poor renal perfusion. Abnormalities in the blood or urine may help detect severe anemia or renal failure as precipitating &#173;factors in CHF. Abnormal liver enzyme levels are common if venous congestion is pres&#173;ent as a result of right ventricular failure.</p>
			<p class="h2">Etiology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As noted previously, IHD is the most common cause of CHF. Cumulative injury to the ventricular myocardium from ischemia and infarction can lead to impaired ventricular systolic and diastolic function and, ultimately, pump failure. Additional &#173;causes of systolic dysfunction include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">valvular heart disease (aortic stenosis and aortic or mitral regurgitation)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">cardiomyopathies (idiopathic, metabolic, infectious, toxic, or connective tissue disease)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">myocarditis (secondary to viral or inflammatory diseases)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">infiltrative diseases (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and metastatic disease)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">left ventricular hypertrophy</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Right-&#173; and left-&#173;sided heart failure often occur si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously in the common &#173;causes of CHF—&#173;namely, IHD, valvular disease, and the congestive cardiomyopathies. The &#173;causes of HFpEF include severe anemia, hyperthyroidism, arteriovenous fistulas, beriberi, and Paget disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In HFpEF, the demand for oxygen is so &#173;great that the heart eventually fails &#173;because it cannot maintain the excessive cardiac output in&#173;def&#173;initely. In some patients, heart failure may be more complex; for example, CHF may develop in a patient with IHD who has become severely anemic. Pure right ventricular failure may result from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid or pulmonary valve disease, right ventricular infarction, or constrictive pericarditis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Medical and Nonsurgical Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Appropriate treatment at each stage of CHF is summarized in Figure&#160;5-4. In both HFrEF and HFpEF, treatment of under&#173;lying &#173;causes and exacerbating conditions (cardiac is&#173;chemia, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, sleep apnea) is of critical importance in managing symptoms and preventing deterioration. Patients with systolic failure or HFrEF &#173;will also benefit from treatment specifically for their CHF, while diastolic or HFpEF &#173;patients rely almost solely on the treatment of their individual disease pro&#173;cesses.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management of HFrEF (systolic dysfunction)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In most clinical situations, reducing afterload is the most effective way to manage heart failure with a reduced EF. Lowering vascular re&#173;sis&#173;tance and arterial blood pressure decreases the burden on the left ventricle and enhances contraction and ejection. Regardless of the baseline values, reducing blood pressure (while maintaining adequate tissue perfusion) is the mainstay of treatment of HFrEF. Therapeutic options include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">ACE inhibitors.</span> The most effective agents for reducing afterload are captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril. They decrease clinical signs of CHF as well as rates of morbidity and mortality.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="greek_italic">b</span><span class="italic">-&#173;Blockers.</span> &#173;These drugs include carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol. They decrease mortality and hospitalization rates and, if not contraindicated, should be used in almost all CHF patients.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Angiotensin II receptor blockers.</span> Candesartan and valsartan may be used when &#173;hypotension from ACE inhibitors would not be tolerated.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Amlodipine.</span> Other calcium channel blockers should be avoided in CHF.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Other afterload-&#173;reducing agents.</span> &#173;These include hydralazine, clonidine, and, for &#173;patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors due to renal disease, <span class="greek">a</span>-&#173;adrenergic blockers (eg, prazosin, doxazosin).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Treatment of anemia.</span> Intravenous iron replacement may be used to treat anemia, but erythropoietin should be avoided.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-16"><span class="italic">Lifestyle modification.</span> Helpful lifestyle changes include smoking cessation, salt restriction, weight loss, exercise, and cardiac rehabilitation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">For patients with HFrEF, the contractility of the left ventricle can be enhanced with inotropic agents. <span class="italic">Digoxin</span> is reserved mainly for patients who remain symptomatic despite the use of diuretics and ACE inhibitors and for patients with CHF and atrial fibrillation requiring rate control. The other oral inotropic agents have not proved safe or effective in patients with chronic CHF; however, intravenous inotropic agents play a key role in treating hospitalized patients with worsening heart failure. Digoxin should not be used in patients with HFpEF (diastolic failure).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Management of HFpEF (diastolic dysfunction)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Heart failure with preserved EF can be improved by reducing preload, which in turn lowers filling pressures in the ventricle. Preload can be reduced by decreasing circulating blood volume, by increasing the capacitance of the venous bed, and by improving systolic function to empty the ventricle more effectively. Therapy for patients with HFpEF should focus on managing the contributing disease pro&#173;cesses. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-17">Hypertension may be managed with diuretics (spironolactone) and <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Atrial fibrillation is pres&#173;ent in two-&#173;thirds of HFpEF patients. Consider treatment to control rate and rhythm.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Cardiac ischemia is pres&#173;ent in two-&#173;thirds of &#173;these patients. Consider use of PCI or CABG.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Hyperlipidemia may be treated with statins in patients with HFpEF (they are not beneficial in HFrEF).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">Obesity may be managed with weight loss, exercise training, and cardiac rehabilitation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Other approaches to CHF</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Whenever pos&#173;si&#173;ble, the under&#173;lying &#173;causes and/or contributing &#173;factors for CHF should be identified and addressed. Precipitating &#173;factors can include excessive salt or fluid intake, poor medi&#173;cation adherence, excessive activity, obesity, pulmonary infection or embolism, MI, renal disease, anemia, thyrotoxicosis, and arrhythmias.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intermittent arrhythmias may seriously compromise ventricular function. Tachyarrhythmias may aggravate ischemia; bradyarrhythmias may decrease cardiac output and blood pressure further. As previously discussed, <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-&#173;blockers should be considered for all patients with CHF for their effects on overall mortality, although they appear to be more effective in HFrEF than in HFpEF. Amiodarone was not found to be beneficial in the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-&#173;HeFT), and most other antiarrhythmic agents are contraindicated in CHF &#173;because they may decrease cardiac function and be paradoxically proarrhythmic. ICDs can be useful adjuncts to medical therapy in patients with CHF, cardiomyopathy, and an EF of 35% or less; and they improved mortality in both the MADIT II and SCD-&#173;HeFT &#173;trials. Biventricular pacing also improves mortality rates and decreases rehospitalization rates in patients with CHF and a wide QRS complex by improving contraction efficiency. Patients with heart block or other severe bradyarrhythmias may also require cardiac pacing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation should receive anti&#173;coagulation therapy &#173;unless contraindications exist. Many physicians also prescribe anticoagulation for patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy, low EF, and normal sinus rhythm, if &#173;there are no contraindications. Options include warfarin, DAT, and newer agents such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban. Risk &#173;factors, cost, tolerability, and potential drug interactions should all be considered during agent se&#173;lection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other mea&#173;sures that can help in managing CHF are restricting dietary sodium, avoiding fluid overload by carefully monitoring oral and intravenous fluid intake, controlling pain and anxiety, treating concomitant metabolic and pulmonary diseases, and providing supplemental oxygen to hypoxemic patients. Fi&#173;nally, all patients with CHF should receive an influenza vaccination and the pneumococcal vaccine.</p>
			<p class="h2">Invasive or Surgical Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with CHD, the leading cause of CHF, may benefit from coronary revascularization by &#173;either CABG or PCI. Depending on the under&#173;lying &#173;causes, other surgical procedures that may be helpful in CHF include percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty, mitral or aortic valve replacement, and pericardiectomy. Left ventricular reconstruction to reduce the volume of a dilated left ventricle has been performed but has not had favorable outcomes in the STICH and other &#173;trials. Cardiac transplantation can be an effective surgical treatment for patients with refractory or end-&#173;stage CHF, but the availability of organs and facilities is limited. Many transplant centers have achieved a 1-&#173;year survival rate that exceeds 85% for a first graft. Implantable ventricular assist devices may help to maintain patients awaiting cardiac transplantation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fi&#173;nally, &#173;because many patients with advanced CHF are older and have multiple comorbidities, palliative care directed only at symptomatic improvement should also be considered.</p>

			<p class="h1">Disorders of Cardiac Rhythm</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Abnormalities of cardiac rhythm can vary widely, from asymptomatic premature atrial complexes and mild sinus bradycardia to life-&#173;threatening ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Disorders of cardiac rhythm can be categorized into several groups, including bradyarrhythmias and conduction disturbances, ec&#173;topic or premature contractions, and tachyarrhythmias.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although many rhythm and conduction disturbances are caused by under&#173;lying IHD, they are also attributable to valvular heart disease, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, congenital aberrant conduction pathways, pulmonary disease, toxic or metabolic disorders, neurogenic &#173;causes, and cardiac trauma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The electrical impulse that initiates each heartbeat normally begins in the <span class="italic">sinoatrial (SA) node</span> and is conducted down through the atria and ventricles, resulting in a coordinated series of contractions of &#173;these chambers. The SA node is the primary pacemaker of the heart. It controls the heart rate and is influenced by neural, biochemical, and pharmacologic &#173;factors. If the SA node function is depressed or absent, secondary pacemakers in the <span class="italic">atrioventricular (AV) junction,</span> the <span class="italic">bundle of His,</span> or the <span class="italic">ventricular muscle</span> can generate stimuli and maintain the heartbeat. Normally, stimulus formation in &#173;these secondary pacemaker sites is slower than in the SA node. However, abnormal stimuli can also be generated at any of &#173;these sites at a rapid pace, resulting in tachycardia.</p>
			<p class="h2">Bradyarrhythmias and Conduction Disturbances</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A <span class="italic">bradyarrhythmia</span> is any rhythm resulting in a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats per minute (bpm). <span class="italic">Conduction block,</span> or <span class="italic">heart block,</span> is a condition in which electrical signals are slowed or interrupted between the atria and ventricles. Bradyarrhythmias and conduction blocks are generally asymptomatic, although they may cause lightheadedness or syncope in rare cases. If the condition is linked to medi&#173;cation use, simply discontinuing the inciting medi&#173;cation may lead to resolution of the bradycardia. Treatment is generally unnecessary except in patients with syncope or hemodynamic instability. In &#173;those cases, placement of a cardiac pacemaker is usually the definitive treatment.</p>
			<p class="h2">Premature Contractions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The principal types of premature contractions are <span class="italic">premature atrial complexes (PACs), premature junctional complexes (PJCs),</span> and <span class="italic">premature ventricular complexes (PVCs).</span> &#173;These complexes result from ec&#173;topic premature depolarization arising from the atria (PACs), the AV node or proximal His-&#173;Purkinje system (PJCs), or the ventricles (PVCs). Often, patients have no symptoms, or they may have a sensation of “skipped beats.” In many cases, no treatment is needed, but <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers or calcium channel blockers can be helpful in symptomatic patients. The correction of under&#173;lying abnormalities (eg, drug toxicity, electrolyte imbalance, hyperthyroidism) is often curative.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Premature ventricular complexes typically require no therapy. However, frequent or complex PVCs in the presence of cardiac disease are markers of an increased risk of SCD. Symptomatic patients requiring treatment are best managed with class II drugs (<span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers) &#173;because class I drugs (sodium channel blockers) and class III drugs (potassium channel blockers) appear to worsen the arrhythmia in 5%–20% of patients. Although it is clinically useful, the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmic drugs (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;5-3</span>) represents an oversimplification, &#173;because many of &#173;these medi&#173;cations may have multiple mechanisms of action.</p>
			<p class="h2">Tachyarrhythmias</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Tachyarrhythmia</span> is defined as a heart rate in excess of 100&#160;bpm in an individual at rest. Tachycardias are classified as <span class="italic">supraventricular</span> or <span class="italic">ventricular,</span> depending on the mechanism and site of origin. <span class="italic">Narrow complex tachycardias</span> are almost exclusively supraventricular in origin; <span class="italic">wide complex tachycardias</span> may be &#173;either supraventricular or ventricular in origin. Correct identification of the origin and mechanisms of the tachycardia is critical to selecting appropriate treatment. The exact site of the pacing focus may be difficult to determine when the heart rate is very rapid.</p>
			<p class="h3">Supraventricular tachycardias</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The category of supraventricular tachycardias includes <span class="italic">paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, </span><span class="italic">AV junctional tachycardia, atrial flutter,</span> and <span class="italic">atrial fibrillation.</span> Supraventricular tachycardias may be paroxysmal or chronic, as with chronic atrial fibrillation. &#173;Causes include emotional stress; caffeine, alcohol, or drug use; thyrotoxicosis; lung disease; and cardiac disease. A patient with a supraventricular tachycardia often experiences palpitations and, in some cases, syncope. <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;Blockers are often useful in the management of &#173;these disorders, and catheter-&#173;guided radiofrequency ablation may be curative in patients with refractory supraventricular tachycardia. The prognosis for supraventricular tachycardia is usually better than that associated with ventricular tachycardia.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Atrial fibrillation</span> Atrial fibrillation is caused by multiple simultaneous wavelets occurring in both the right and the left atria, leading to a chaotic electrical rhythm with in&#173;effec&#173;tive atrial contraction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 5-5</span>). Cardiac output may be markedly reduced when the ventricular rate is very rapid, possibly resulting in CHF. Atrial thrombi may accumulate from stagnation of blood in the atrial appendages. &#173;These thrombi may embolize to the lungs, brain, or other organs. Anticoagulation therapy is indicated for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and chronic atrial flutter associated with valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, or cardiomegaly and before conversion to sinus rhythm is attempted. Several risk stratification tools (eg, CHADS2) have been devised to weigh the risk of embolism against the risk of bleeding in &#173;these patients. Newer classes of oral anticoagulants, including direct thrombin inhibitors (dagibatran) and &#173;factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban), are superior to warfarin in prevention of stroke, with comparable bleeding risks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Conversion of atrial fibrillation can be attempted with flecainide, dofetilide, propafenone, ibutilide, or direct-&#173;current (DC) cardioversion. In many patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, maintenance therapy is directed &#173;toward controlling the ventricular rate, which can usually be accomplished with verapamil, <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-&#173;blockers, or amiodarone.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other curative approaches have been developed for both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. &#173;These treatments include radiofrequency catheter ablation and the surgical maze procedure. The <span class="italic">maze procedure</span> interrupts all pos&#173;si&#173;ble reentry cir&#173;cuits to the atrium with multiple incisions. A single uninterrupted pathway is left intact to allow normal conduction from the SA node to the AV node. This and other ablative procedures can be performed at the time of CABG or valvular surgery to restore sinus rhythm.</p>

			<p class="h3">Ventricular tachyarrhythmias</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Ventricular tachycardia</span> The ventricular tachyarrhythmias include <span class="italic">ventricular tachycardia (VT), torsades de pointes</span> (a variant of VT), <span class="italic">ventricular flutter,</span> and <span class="italic">ventricular fibrillation.</span> &#173;These arrhythmias may pres&#173;ent with palpitations, heart failure, or syncope or may pro&#173;gress rapidly to sudden cardiac death. VT occurs infrequently in young patients with no organic heart disease. Brief episodes of VT cause palpitations; prolonged attacks in patients with organic cardiac disease can lead to heart failure or cardiac shock. If the rate is not very high, and &#173;there is no significant under&#173;lying heart disease, VT may be well tolerated. However, it may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, resulting in hemodynamic collapse and death.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment with immediate synchronized DC cardioversion is indicated for sustained VT associated with hemodynamic compromise, severe CHF, or ongoing ischemia or infarction. Pharmacologic cardioversion with <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers, calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), or amiodarone may be attempted in patients with clinically stable VT. Amiodarone is generally the agent of choice for recurrent VT if its adverse effects are tolerated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Electrophysiologic testing is often performed in patients with suspected or documented ventricular arrhythmias. In this procedure, direct transcatheter electrical stimulation is applied to vari&#173;ous sites in the ventricle to induce arrhythmias. Given their efficacy and the low risk associated with implantation, ICDs, in conjunction with antiarrhythmic drugs, have become the treatment of choice for patients with life-&#173;threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Radiofrequency catheter ablation can also be performed in patients resistant to medical therapy.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h4-head">Ventricular fibrillation</span> Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the most ominous of all the cardiac arrhythmias &#173;because it is fatal when untreated or when refractory to treatment. It is a major cause of SCD outside the hospital. The ventricular contractions are rapid and un&#173;co&#173;or&#173;di&#173;nated, resulting in in&#173;effec&#173;tive ventricular pumping that soon leads to syncope, convulsions, and death if the VF is not interrupted. The prognosis is generally poor &#173;because each episode can be fatal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts must be initiated emergently. Immediate unsynchronized DC cardioversion is the primary therapy. &#173;After successful cardioversion, continuous intravenous infusion of effective antiarrhythmic therapy should be maintained &#173;until any reversible &#173;causes have been corrected. The choice of long-&#173;term antiarrhythmic therapy depends on the conditions responsible for the initial VF episode. Primary VF occurring within the first few hours of an acute MI is not associated with an elevated risk of recurrence and does not require long-&#173;term antiarrhythmic therapy. However, VF without an identifiable and reversible cause requires implantation of an automatic defibrillator. If a patient refuses an ICD, prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy (eg, amiodarone, sotalol) may be used, but multiple studies have demonstrated that an ICD is more effective in preventing SCD.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Implantable cardioverter-&#173;defibrillators</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">ICDs monitor heart rhythm and, when a potentially lethal tachyarrhythmia is identified, deliver therapy. Their evolution has been impressive. Initially, a thoracotomy was necessary to implant an epicardial patch or patches. Most patients now receive a transvenous system, which significantly reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with the implantation of &#173;these devices. Current-&#173;generation ICDs are generally implanted in the prepectoral region (similar to pacemaker implantation). Although first-&#173;generation ICDs delivered only high-&#173;energy defibrillating shocks, current-&#173;generation devices provide tiered therapy, including pacing algorithms for tachycardia, low-&#173;energy cardioversion for stable VT, high-&#173;energy cardioversion for VT or VF, single-&#173;chamber or dual-&#173;chamber pacing support for bradycardia, and stored diagnostic information for rhythm discrimination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">ICDs treat arrhythmias when they occur but do not prevent them. Most patients require concomitant antiarrhythmic therapy (<span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers, amiodarone) to reduce the frequency of device discharges or to facilitate antitachycardia pacing by slowing the ventricular rate. If the device fails to terminate an arrhythmia, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and external defibrillation should proceed normally. Three randomized prospective studies have demonstrated that automatic ICDs are the preferred first-&#173;line therapy for patients who have survived a cardiac arrest or an episode of hemodynamically unstable VT, with a 20%–30% relative reduction in the risk of death. The MUSTT and MADIT &#173;trials have also proved the benefit of ICDs for primary prevention of sudden death in patients with CHD, reduced EFs, nonsustained VT, or inducible ventricular arrhythmias during electrophysiologic testing. Following an MI, ICDs appear to be the best available therapy for preventing SCD. An ICD should be considered for patients on optimal medical therapy who have left ventricular dysfunction from an MI that occurred at least 40 days previously and an expected survival with good functional status of at least 1 year. Ongoing &#173;trials may expand the role of ICDs in the primary prevention of sudden death.</p>

They often undergo stressful eye surgery &#173;under local or general anesthesia, and ophthalmologists need to be cognizant of &#173;these patients’ risks of myo&#173;car&#173;dial ischemia, myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction, CHF, and arrhythmias. Similarly, ophthalmologists need to be aware of the association between proliferative diabetic retinopathy and IHD. This information should be given to the primary medical care provider of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy but no diagnosis of IHD so that appropriate screening tests can be considered.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">Cardiac complications of noncardiac surgery are a major cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality, MI being the most significant. Older <br />age, preexisting CHD, and CHF are the principal risk &#173;factors for development <br />of &#173;these complications.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">ICDs are increasingly used for the management of cardiac arrhythmias. Although no cases of discharge of an ICD during ocular surgery have been reported, the ophthalmologist should discuss the status and pos&#173;si&#173;ble perioperative disabling of the ICD with the cardiologist or anesthesiologist before ocular surgery to avoid surgical complications.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">Fi&#173;nally, ophthalmologists should be aware of the potential ocular adverse effects associated with medi&#173;cations commonly used in treating CVD. Following are the medi&#173;cations of clinical relevance:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="sidebar2-bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Amiodarone.</span> Corneal microdeposits occur in nearly all patients who use amiodarone for an extended period of time (years). The corneal epithelial whorl-&#173;like deposition is indistinguishable from that due to chloroquine. Visual changes are unusual; patients most often report hazy vision or colored halos around lights. Photosensitivity reactions from amiodarone may lead to discoloration (usually slate gray or blue) of periocular skin. A rare adverse effect is amiodarone optic neuropathy, which is characterized by an insidious onset, slow progression, bilateral vision loss, and protracted optic nerve head swelling that tends to stabilize within several months of discontinuing the medi&#173;cation. Patients on long-&#173;term amiodarone therapy should have a baseline ophthalmic examination, follow-up examinations &#173;every 6–12 months, and immediate evaluation of any new visual disturbances. &#173;Because of this drug’s photosensitizing effects, UV-&#173;blocking spectacle lenses should be considered in selected cases of chronic eyelid disease or macular disease.</li>
				<li class="sidebar2-bullet-list-mid"><span class="greek_italic">b</span><span class="italic">-&#173;Blockers.</span> The use of some <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers can lead to a keratoconjunctivitis sicca–&#173;like syndrome, prob&#173;ably due to decreased lacrimation. They may also possibly enhance migraine ocular scotomata and may decrease intraocular pressure (IOP). Topical <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers, particularly timolol, may be less effective in lowering IOP in patients concurrently taking systemic <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers. Visual disturbances and vivid visual hallucinations may also be associated with the systemic use of <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;blockers.</li>
				<li class="sidebar2-bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Digoxin.</span> Glare and disturbances of color vision are the most common and striking ocular adverse effects. They include decreased vision and prob&#173;lems with color vision, such as blue-&#173;yellow pattern defects; a yellow, green, blue, or red tinge to objects; and colored halos (mainly blue) around lights. Patients on digoxin may also describe yellow or green flickering vision, colored borders around objects, glare phenomena, light flashes, scintillating scotomata, a frosted appearance to objects, and formed visual hallucinations.</li>
