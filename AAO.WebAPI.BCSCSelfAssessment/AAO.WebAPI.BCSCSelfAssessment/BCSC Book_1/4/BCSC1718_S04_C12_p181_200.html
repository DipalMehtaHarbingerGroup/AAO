			<p class="chapter-title">Uveal Tract</p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Topography</p>
				<div id="Chapt12_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">iris, ciliary body,</span> and <span class="italic">choroid</span> constitute the uveal tract (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-1</span>). The uveal tract is embryologically derived from mesoderm and neural crest cells. Firm attachments between the uveal tract and the sclera exist at only 3&#160;sites: (1) the scleral spur, (2) the exit points of the vortex veins, and (3) the optic nerve.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Iris</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The iris is located in front of the crystalline lens. It separates the anterior segment of the eye into 2&#160;compartments, the anterior chamber and the posterior chamber, and forms a circular aperture (pupil) that controls the amount of light transmitted into the eye. The iris comprises 5&#160;layers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-3">anterior border layer</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">stromal layer</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">muscular layer</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">anterior layer of pigment epithelium</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-4">posterior layer of pigment epithelium</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The anterior border layer, which represents a condensation of iris stroma and melanocytes, is coarsely ribbed with numerous crypts (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-2</span>). The stroma contains blood vessels, nerves, melanocytes, fibrocytes, and 2&#160;types of clump cells: macrophages containing phagocytosed pigment (type&#160;I, or clump cells of Koganei) and variants of smooth-&#173;muscle cells (type&#160;II clump cells). The vessels within the stroma have a thick collar of collagen. The muscular layer is made up of the dilator muscle and the sphincter muscle. Both are composed of smooth-&#173;muscle cells and are under autonomic control; however, the dilator muscle is part of the anterior layer of pigment epithelium. The posterior iris is lined with a double layer of cuboidal epithelium arranged in an apex-to-apex configuration. The cytoplasm of these epithelial cells is packed with melanin granules; iris color is determined by the number and size of the melanin pigment granules in the iris stromal melanocytes.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Ciliary Body</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ciliary body, which is approximately 6.0–6.5&#160;mm wide, extends from the base of the iris and becomes continuous with the choroid at the ora serrata. The ciliary body is composed of 2&#160;areas: the <span class="italic">pars plicata,</span> which contains the ciliary processes, and the <span class="italic">pars plana.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">The inner portion of the ciliary body is lined by a double layer of epithelial cells, the inner nonpigmented layer and the outer pigmented layer (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-3</span>). The zonular fibers of the lens attach to the ciliary body in the valleys of the ciliary processes and along the pars plana. The ciliary smooth muscle comprises 3&#160;layers of fibers: the outermost <span class="italic">longitudinal</span> layer, the middle <span class="italic">radial</span> layer, and <span class="italic">the innermost circular</span> layer. These muscle groups function as a unit during accommodation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Choroid</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The choroid is the pigmented vascular tissue that forms the middle coat of the posterior part of the eye. It extends from the ora serrata anteriorly to the optic nerve posteriorly and consists of 3&#160;principal layers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-6">lamina fusca—suprachoroidal pigmented layer with attachments to sclera</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">stroma—central loose fibrovascular connective tissue with arterioles originating from the short posterior ciliary arteries</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">choriocapillaris—innermost layer containing thin-walled capillaries</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The choriocapillaris is the blood supply for the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the outer retinal layers (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-4</span>).</p>

			<p class="h1">Congenital Anomalies</p>
				<div id="Chapt12_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Aniridia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">True aniridia, or complete absence of the iris, is rare. Most cases of aniridia are incomplete, with a narrow rim of rudimentary iris tissue present. Aniridia is usually bilateral, though sometimes asymmetric. Histologically, the rudimentary iris consists of underdeveloped ectodermal–mesodermal neural crest elements. The angle is often incompletely developed, and peripheral anterior synechiae that have an overgrowth of corneal endothelium are often present, most likely accounting for the high incidence of glaucoma associated with aniridia. Other ocular findings in aniridia include cataract, corneal pannus, and foveal hypoplasia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Both autosomal dominant and sporadic inheritance patterns for aniridia have been described. An association between sporadic aniridia and Wilms tumor has been linked to 11p13 deletions and to mutations in the <span class="italic">PAX6</span> gene, which is located in the same region. Microcephaly, cognitive impairment, and genitourinary abnormalities have also been associated with aniridia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See also BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> and Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span> for further discussion of aniridia.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Coloboma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A coloboma—the absence of part or all of normal ocular tissue—may affect the iris, ciliary body, choroid, or all 3&#160;structures (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-5</span>). Histologically, colobomas appear as an area nearly devoid of retinal and choroidal tissue. A thin layer of glial tissue (intercalary membrane) may be the only tissue overlying the sclera. See BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> and Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> for further discussion of uveal colobomas.</p>

			<p class="h1">Inflammations</p>
				<div id="Chapt12_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for further discussion of the conditions described in the following sections and an in-depth explanation of the immunologic processes involved.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Infectious</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infectious processes in the uveal tract may be restricted to that layer or part of a generalized inflammation that affects multiple or all coats of the eye. If the eye is the primary source of the infection (eg, as in posttraumatic bacterial infection), that infection is termed <span class="italic">exogenous.</span> If, however, the infection originates elsewhere in the body (eg, a ruptured diverticulum) and subsequently spreads hematogenously to involve the uveal tract, the infection is referred to as <span class="italic">endogenous.</span> A wide variety of organisms can cause infections of the uveal tract, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histology often shows a mix of acute and chronic inflammatory cells within the choroid, ciliary body, or iris stroma. In cases of viral, fungal, or protozoal (eg, toxoplasmosis) agents, epithelioid histiocytes are typically present (granulomatous inflammation). If infection is suspected, special stains (see Chapter&#160;3, Table&#160;3-2) for microorganisms (tissue Gram, Gomori methenamine silver, PAS&#160;[periodic acid–Schiff], Ziehl-&#173;Neelsen) may be helpful.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Noninfectious</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Sympathetic ophthalmia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare bilateral granulomatous panuveitis that occurs after accidental or surgical injury to 1&#160;eye (the <span class="italic">exciting,</span> or <span class="italic">inciting, eye</span>) followed by a latent period of weeks to years before development of uveitis in the uninjured globe (the <span class="italic">sympathizing eye</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sympathetic ophthalmia is a clinical diagnosis. The histopathologic findings are not pathognomonic. Furthermore, immunosuppressive therapy may modify the histologic findings. Histologically, a diffuse granulomatous inflammatory reaction that is composed of lymphocytes and epithelioid histiocytes containing phagocytosed melanin pigment is present within the uveal tract (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 12-6, 12-7</span>). Plasma cells are usually scant, suggesting a cell-&#173;mediated response. Classically, in the early stages of the disease, the choriocapillaris is spared. Varying degrees of inflammation may be present in the anterior chamber, such as clusters of histiocytes deposited on the corneal endothelium <span class="italic">(mutton-&#173;fat keratic precipitates).</span> <span class="italic">Dalen-&#173;Fuchs nodules,</span> which are accumulations of epithelioid histiocytes and lymphocytes between the RPE and Bruch membrane, may be seen in some cases (see Fig&#160;12-7). However, Dalen-&#173;Fuchs nodules may also be present in other diseases, such as Vogt-Koyanagi-&#173;Harada syndrome, and thus are not pathognomonic of sympathetic ophthalmia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> and Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="h3">Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome is a rare cause of posterior or diffuse uveitis and may have both ocular and systemic manifestations. The syndrome occurs more commonly in patients with Asian or Native American ancestry and usually affects individuals between 30 and 50&#160;years of age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A chronic, diffuse granulomatous uveitis resembles that seen in sympathetic ophthalmia. However, in VKH, the entire choroid, including the choriocapillaris, is typically involved by the inflammatory reaction. The granulomatous inflammation may extend into the retina. Because the disease is one of exacerbation and remission, chorioretinal scarring and RPE hyperplasia and/or atrophy may also occur.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Sarcoidosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disorder that can affect nearly all systems in the body. The disease is characterized by inflammatory nodule formation in various organs and tissues. The uveal tract is the most common site of ocular involvement. Anteriorly, inflammatory nodules of the iris may develop, either at the pupillary margin <span class="italic">(Koeppe nodules)</span> or elsewhere on the iris <span class="italic">(Busacca nodules).</span> In the posterior segment, chorioretinitis, periphlebitis, and chorioretinal nodules may be present. Periphlebitis may appear clinically as inflammatory lesions called <span class="italic">candlewax drippings.</span> Inflammatory cell infiltration may cause the optic nerve head to become swollen.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, the classic sarcoid nodule is composed of non-&#173;necrotizing (noncaseating) granulomas. These granulomas are collections of epithelioid histiocytes, sometimes accompanied by multinucleated giant cells, surrounded by a cuff of lymphocytes (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-8</span>). In the uvea, the inflammatory infiltrate may show a more diffuse distribution of lymphocytes and epithelioid histiocytes (granulomatous inflammation). The multinucleated giant cells may demonstrate <span class="italic">asteroid bodies</span> (star-shaped, acidophilic bodies) and/or <span class="italic">Schaumann bodies</span> (spherical, basophilic, calcified bodies). Neither asteroid nor Schaumann bodies are pathognomonic for sarcoidosis.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Behçet disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Behçet disease is an occlusive systemic vasculitis that can cause nongranulomatous necrotizing inflammation in the uveal tract. See BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Juvenile xanthogranuloma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) is an uncommon inflammatory condition that occurs in children. The skin and uvea are commonly affected areas; in the uveal tract, lesions may present as a solid mass, mimicking a neoplastic process. Histologically, the characteristic appearance of the lesions includes the presence of lipid-&#173;laden histiocytes, Touton giant cells, lymphocytes, and occasional eosinophils (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-9</span>). The lesions are often vascularized, and the blood vessels tend to be fragile, resulting in intralesional hemorrhage. Iris JXG lesions may cause a spontaneous hyphema.</p>

				<div id="Chapt12_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Rubeosis Iridis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rubeosis iridis, or neovascularization of the iris (see Chapter&#160;11, Fig&#160;11-27), is commonly found in surgically enucleated blind eyes. It may be associated with a wide variety of conditions (see BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> Table&#160;5-4). Histologically, the new vessels tend to lack supporting tissue and do not possess the thick fibrous cuff that encircles normal iris vessels. The new vessels grow on the anterior surface of the iris and may extend into the angle. The neovascular membrane has a fibrous component consisting of myofibroblasts, which contract and eventually lead to angle closure due to formation of peripheral anterior synechiae. Neovascularization of the angle often results in <span class="italic">neovascular glaucoma,</span> a secondary glaucoma. Membrane contraction may also lead to <span class="italic">ectropion uveae,</span> an anterior displacement or dragging of the posterior iris pigment epithelial layer onto the anterior iris surface at the pupillary border. The anterior surface of the iris often becomes flattened. In advanced cases, atrophy of the dilator muscle, attenuation of the pigment epithelium, and stromal fibrosis may occur (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-10</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Hyalinization of the Ciliary Body</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Over time, the ciliary body processes become hyalinized and fibrosed, losing stromal cellularity; occasionally, dystrophic calcification develops. The thin, delicate processes become blunted and attenuated, and the stroma becomes more eosinophilic (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-11</span>). This process is a normal age-&#173;related change to the ciliary body and is not considered pathologic, although it does contribute functionally to the development of <br />presbyopia.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Choroidal Neovascularization</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Choroidal neovascularization is discussed at length in Chapter&#160;11 and in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>

			<p class="h1">Neoplasia</p>
				<div id="Chapt12_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Uveal neoplasms are also discussed in detail in Chapters&#160;17, 18, and&#160;20. The discussion of uveal neoplasms in this chapter focuses primarily on histopathology.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Iris</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Nevus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An <span class="italic">iris nevus</span> is a localized proliferation of melanocytic cells that generally appears as a darkly pigmented lesion of the iris stroma with minimal distortion of the iris architecture (see Chapter&#160;17, Fig&#160;17-1). An iris nevus appears histologically as an accumulation of branching dendritic cells or spindle cells, usually with melanin granules in the cytoplasm. The nuclei of these cells are typically oblong or ovoid with a bland appearance and indistinct nucleoli. Less commonly, epithelioid nevus cells may be observed. A variety of growth patterns and cytologic appearances is possible, but cellular atypia and significant mitotic activity are not present. The nevus cells aggregate within the stroma and sometimes also appear in a plaquelike distribution on the surface of the iris (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-12</span>). Occasionally, nevus cells may extend into the adjacent angle structures.</p>
			<p class="h3">Melanoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Melanomas arising in the iris tend to follow a nonaggressive clinical course, in contrast to posterior (ciliochoroidal) melanomas. The majority of iris melanomas develop in the inferior sectors of the iris (see Chapter&#160;17, Fig&#160;17-3). The lesions can be quite vascularized and may occasionally cause spontaneous hyphema.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Iris melanomas can be composed of spindle melanoma cells, epithelioid melanoma cells, or a combination of these. Histologically, spindle cells possess plump, spindle-&#173;shaped nuclei that have a coarse, granular appearance and prominent nucleoli. These cells are the equivalent of spindle-B cells in posterior uveal melanoma (see the “Melanoma” section under Choroid and Ciliary Body). Epithelioid cells are polyhedral in shape, with large, round nuclei that have a clumped chromatin pattern and prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. Both types of cells tend to have a high nuclear-to-&#173;cytoplasmic ratio. The cytoplasm of melanoma cells can range from amelanotic to heavily pigmented. Typically, iris melanomas grow as a solid mass in the stroma, sometimes covered by a surface plaque. Occasionally, they may demonstrate satellite lesions or a diffuse growth pattern that replaces normal stroma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-13</span>). The modified Callender classification for posterior melanomas (see the “Melanoma” section) is not applicable to iris melanomas in terms of prognostic significance. Iris melanomas are classified by a separate staging system, which is based on infiltration of adjacent structures and the presence or absence of coexisting glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although iris melanomas may grow in a locally aggressive fashion, they rarely metastasize. One exception occurs when melanomas grow to diffusely involve the entire iris stroma. The melanoma may invade into the anterior chamber angle and extend posteriorly to involve the ciliary body.</p>

			<p class="h2">Choroid and Ciliary Body</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Nevus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most uveal tract nevi (&gt;90%) develop in the choroid (see Chapter&#160;17, Fig&#160;17-2). Nevus cells are divided into one of the following 4&#160;types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-3"><span class="italic">plump polyhedral:</span> abundant cytoplasm is filled with pigment and has a small, round to oval nucleus with bland appearance</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">slender spindle</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-14</span>): cytoplasm contains scant pigment and a small, dark, elongated nucleus</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">plump fusiform dendritic:</span> morphology is intermediate between plump polyhedral and slender spindle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-4"><span class="italic">balloon cells:</span> abundant, foamy cytoplasm lacks pigment and has a bland nucleus</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Depending on the size and location of the nevus, it may exert nonspecific effects on adjacent ocular tissues. The associated choriocapillaris may become compressed or obliterated, and drusen may form overlying the nevus. Less commonly, the nevus may be associated with localized serous detachments of the overlying RPE or neurosensory retina; in addition, secondary choroidal neovascularization may develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most choroidal nevi remain stationary over long periods of observation. However, the presence of nevus cells that are associated with some melanomas supplies evidence that melanomas may arise from choroidal nevi.</p>
			<p class="h3">Melanocytoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Melanocytoma is a specific type of uveal tract nevus (magnocellular nevus) that warrants separate consideration. These jet-black lesions may occur anywhere in the uveal tract, but they appear most commonly in the peripapillary region (see Chapter&#160;15, Fig&#160;15-12B).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, a melanocytoma is composed of plump polyhedral cells with small nuclei and abundant cytoplasm. Because the nevus cells are so heavily pigmented, it is usually necessary to obtain bleached sections to accurately study the cytologic features (see Chapter&#160;15, Fig&#160;15-12C,&#160;D). Areas of cystic degeneration or necrosis may be observed.</p>
			<p class="h3">Melanoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults is melanoma arising from the ciliary body and choroid. When this type of tumor grows to a significant size, it may extend beyond its site of origin (ie, from the choroid to the ciliary body and vice versa). Ciliary body and choroidal melanomas exhibit similar features and may be referred to collectively as posterior uveal melanomas, which have similar histologic features and prognostic implications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, posterior uveal melanomas are composed of spindle cells and/or epithelioid cells (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;12-15, 12-16, 12-17</span>). Less commonly, balloon cells similar to those seen in nevi may be present. Spindle cell melanomas consist primarily of spindle-B melanoma cells. They may also contain spindle-A cells; however, a tumor consisting entirely of spindle-A cells is considered a nevus. The cytoplasmic melanin content in melanoma cells can vary considerably. The mitotic rate in melanomas tends to be low, and these tumors may exhibit variable amounts of necrosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Melanomas typically start as dome-shaped lesions and, as they grow and break through Bruch membrane, they acquire a mushroom or collar-&#173;button shape (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-18</span>). Less commonly, choroidal lesions may grow in a diffuse pattern, replacing normal choroid without achieving significant height (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-19</span>). In the ciliary body, the equivalent of the diffuse pattern is the <span class="italic">ring melanoma,</span> in which the tumor extends for the entire circumference of the ciliary body (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-20</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Choroidal melanomas may also cause serous detachments of the overlying and adjacent retina, with subsequent degenerative changes in the outer segments of the photoreceptors (see Figs&#160;12-18B, 12-19). Melanomas may extend through scleral emissary canals to gain access to the episcleral surface and the orbit (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-21</span>). Less commonly, aggressive melanomas may directly invade the underlying sclera or overlying retina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-22</span>). Direct invasion of the anterior chamber or mechanical blockage due to forward iris displacement may lead to secondary glaucoma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-23</span>). In addition, tumor necrosis may lead to the dispersal of melanin pigment, which can then enter the anterior chamber and angle, causing a type of secondary glaucoma called <span class="italic">melanomalytic glaucoma</span> (see Chapter&#160;7, Fig&#160;7-12).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several factors, which can be identified via pathologic examination, have been significantly correlated with survival in patients with posterior uveal melanomas. The most important histologic variables associated with survival are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">size of tumor in contact with the sclera</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">tumor cell type</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">extraocular extension</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">ciliary body involvement</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Posterior uveal melanomas are cytologically classified into one of the following categories via the modified Callender classification:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-6">spindle cell melanoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">epithelioid melanoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">mixed-cell type (mixture of spindle and epithelioid cells)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Spindle cell melanoma has the best prognosis, and epithelioid melanoma the worst. Melanomas of mixed-cell type have an intermediate prognosis. Some authors have suggested that survival following enucleation in mixed-cell melanomas decreases with increasing proportions of epithelioid cells. In rare cases, a melanoma undergoes extensive necrosis, and precludes classification. Completely necrotic melanomas assume the same prognosis as mixed-cell melanomas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The modified Callender classification has some disadvantages. First, there is continuing controversy about the minimum number of epithelioid cells needed for a melanoma to be classified as mixed-cell type. Second, the classification is difficult to reproduce, even among experienced ophthalmic pathologists, because the cytologic features of the melanoma cells reflect a continuous spectrum.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">mean of the 10&#160;largest melanoma cell nucleoli (MLN)</span> correlates well with mortality after enucleation. Intrinsic tumor extravascular matrix patterns have prognostic significance. Tumors containing more complex extravascular matrix patterns such as closed loops or networks (3&#160;back-to-back loops) are associated with an increased incidence of subsequent metastases (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-24</span>). Tumor infiltrating macrophages, some of which are pigmented, are universally found; their number relates to tumor prognostication.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Microvascular density shows an association with increased incidence of subsequent metastases that is the same, if not higher, than MLN and extravascular matrix patterns, and is relevant given that the mode of metastasis is overwhelmingly hematogenous.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other factors associated with an increased mortality rate include extrascleral extension, anterior or juxtapapillary location of the tumor, and the presence of tumor-&#173;infiltrating lymphocytes. Invasion through Bruch membrane does not affect survival rates.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Metastases almost invariably result from the hematogenous spread of melanoma to the liver; more than 95% of tumor-&#173;related deaths have liver involvement. In as many as one-third of tumor-&#173;related deaths, the liver is the sole site of metastasis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some types of posterior uveal melanomas show biologic behavior that cannot be predicted according to the criteria just discussed. Survival rates of patients with diffuse ciliary body melanomas (ring melanoma) are particularly poor. These relatively flat tumors, which are almost always of mixed-cell type, may grow circumferentially without becoming significantly elevated. Diffuse choroidal melanomas have a similarly poor prognosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cytogenetic studies of posterior uveal melanoma have shown that mutually exclusive mutations in <span class="italic">GNAQ</span> and <span class="italic">GNA11</span> are an initiating event in the development of uveal melanomas and nevi. Approximately half of uveal melanomas demonstrate monosomy of chromosome&#160;3. A smaller proportion demonstrates gain or loss of a chromosome in chromosomes&#160;1, 6, or&#160;8. Monosomy&#160;3 and trisomy&#160;8 are associated with increased mortality. Gene expression profiling provides prognostic classification of uveal melanomas. The test, which requires a small amount of fresh or paraffin-&#173;embedded tissue, classifies these tumors as either Class&#160;1a (low metastatic potential), Class&#160;1b (intermediate metastatic potential), or Class&#160;2 (high metastatic potential). Mutation of <span class="italic">BAP1</span> is thought to be a later event that confers metastatic potential. More recently, mutations in <span class="italic">SF3B1</span> and <span class="italic">EIF1AX</span> have been found to be associated with a better prognosis in uveal melanoma.</p>

			<p class="h2">Metastatic Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Metastatic lesions are the most common intraocular tumors in adults. These lesions most often involve the choroid, but can affect any ocular structure. Unlike primary uveal melanoma, metastatic lesions are often multiple and may be bilateral. Although these lesions typically assume a flattened growth pattern, rare cases of collar-&#173;button or mushroom-&#173;shaped lesions have been reported. Although tumors from many different primary sites have been reported, the most common primary tumors metastasizing to the eye are breast carcinoma in women and lung carcinoma in men (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-25</span>). Histologically, metastatic tumors may recapitulate the appearance of the primary lesion, or they may appear less differentiated. Special histochemical and immunohistochemical stains can be helpful in diagnosing metastatic lesions, determining the origin of the primary tumor and in some cases guiding therapy for that tumor. The importance of a careful clinical history cannot be overemphasized. See Chapter&#160;20 for further discussion of metastatic tumors.</p>
			<p class="h2">Other Uveal Tumors</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Hemangioma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hemangiomas of the choroid occur in 2&#160;specific forms: circumscribed (ie, localized) and diffuse. <span class="italic">Circumscribed</span> choroidal hemangioma typically occurs in patients without systemic disorders; <span class="italic">diffuse</span> choroidal hemangioma is generally seen in patients with Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome (encephalofacial angiomatosis).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, both diffuse and circumscribed hemangiomas show accumulations of variably sized vessels within the choroid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-26</span>). The lesions may appear as predominantly capillary hemangiomas, cavernous hemangiomas, or a mix of the two. There may be compressed melanocytes, hyperplastic RPE, and fibrous tissue proliferation in the adjacent and overlying choroid. See also Chapter&#160;18 (particularly Figs&#160;18-1 and 18-2) in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous</span> (particularly Fig&#160;9-6).</p>
			<p class="h3">Choroidal osteoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Choroidal osteomas are benign bony tumors that typically arise from the juxtapapillary choroid; they are seen in adolescent to young adult patients, more commonly in females. The characteristic lesion appears yellow to orange and has well-&#173;defined margins (see Chapter&#160;17, Fig&#160;17-11D). Histologically, the tumor is composed of compact bone and is located in the peripapillary choroid. The intratrabecular spaces are filled with a loose connective tissue that contains large and small blood vessels, vacuolated mesenchymal cells, and scattered mast cells. The bony trabeculae contain osteocytes, cement lines, and occasional osteoclasts. See Chapter&#160;17 for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="h3">Lymphoid proliferation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The choroid may be the site of lymphoid proliferation, either as a primary ocular process or in association with systemic lymphoproliferative disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Primary choroidal lymphomas</span> (previously known as <span class="italic">uveal lymphoid hyperplasia or infiltration</span>) are mostly low-grade, B-cell tumors similar to extranodal marginal zone lymphomas elsewhere. High-grade choroidal lymphomas (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-27</span>) are usually secondary to systemic disease or an extension of vitreoretinal lymphoma. The classification of lymphomas is further discussed in Chapter&#160;14.</p>
			<p class="reference-single ParaOverride-13">Coupland SE, Damato B. Understanding intraocular lymphomas. <span class="italic">Clin Experiment Ophthalmol.</span> 2008;36(6):564–578.</p>
			<p class="h3">Neural sheath tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neurilemomas (schwannomas) and neurofibromas are rare tumors found in the uveal tract. Multiple neurofibromas may occur in the ciliary body, iris, and choroid in patients with neurofibromatosis&#160;1 (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-28</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Leiomyoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neoplasms arising from the smooth muscle of the ciliary body have been reported in rare instances. When they occur, they may be clinically confused with amelanotic melanoma or neurofibroma. Histologically, these tumors consist of a proliferation of tightly packed slender spindle cells lacking pigment. Immunohistochemical stains may be useful in diagnosing leiomyomas, because leiomyomas express smooth muscle–related antigens. Under light and transmission electron microscopy, these tumors sometimes exhibit both myogenic and neurogenic features. In such cases, the tumors are called <span class="italic">mesectodermal leiomyoma.</span></p>
