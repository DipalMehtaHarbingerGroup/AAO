			<p class="chapter-title">Retina and Retinal Pigment Epithelium</p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Topography</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Two distinct layers form the inner lining of the posterior two-thirds of the globe:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">&#9;1.&#9;The neurosensory retina, which is a delicate, transparent layer derived from the inner layer of the optic cup.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">&#9;2.&#9;The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is a pigmented layer derived from the outer layer of the optic cup.</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anteriorly, the RPE is continuous with the pigmented ciliary body epithelium, and the neurosensory retina is continuous with the nonpigmented ciliary body epithelium. Posteriorly, the RPE terminates at the optic nerve, just prior to the termination of Bruch membrane. The nuclear, photoreceptor, and synaptic layers of the retina gradually taper at the optic nerve head, and only the nerve fiber layer (NFL) continues on to form the optic nerve. See BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> for additional discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2">Neurosensory Retina</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The topographic variation in the structures of the retina is striking, with regional variation in the neural structures as well as the retinal vasculature. The neurosensory retina has 10&#160;layers (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The arrangement of the retina (in tissue sections that are perpendicular to the retinal surface) is vertical from outer to inner layers, except for the NFL, where the axons run horizontally toward the optic nerve head. Consequently, deposits and hemorrhages in the deep retinal layers have a round appearance clinically, whereas those in the NFL have a feathery or splinter-shaped appearance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Two sources supply the retina with blood, with a watershed zone inside the inner nuclear layer of the retina. The <span class="italic">retinal blood vessels</span> supply the NFL, ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, and inner two-thirds of the inner nuclear layer. The <span class="italic">choroidal vasculature</span> supplies the outer one-third of the inner nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, photoreceptors, and RPE. Because of this division of the blood supply, ischemic choroidal vascular lesions and ischemic lesions attributed to the retinal vasculature produce different histologic pictures. Ischemic retinal injury produces inner retinal atrophy (see Fig&#160;11-14), and choroidal ischemia produces outer retinal atrophy (see Fig&#160;11-15).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, the term <span class="italic">macula</span> refers to the area of the retina where the ganglion cell layer is thicker than a single cell (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-2</span>). Clinically, this area corresponds approximately with the area of the retina bound by the inferior and superior vascular arcades. The macula is subdivided into the <span class="italic">foveola,</span> the <span class="italic">fovea,</span> the <span class="italic">parafovea,</span> and the <span class="italic">perifovea.</span> The central foveola contains only cone photoreceptor cells; ganglion cells, other nucleated cells (including Müller cells), and blood vessels are not present. The concentration of cones is greater in the macula than in the peripheral retina, and only cones are present in the fovea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nerve fibers in the outer plexiform layer of the macula (nerve fiber layer of Henle) run obliquely (see Fig&#160;11-2A). This morphologic feature results in the “flower petal” appearance of cystoid macular edema (CME) observed on fluorescein angiography, as well as the star-shaped configuration of hard exudates observed ophthalmoscopically in conditions that cause macular edema. Xanthophyll pigment gives the macula its yellow appearance clinically and grossly (macula lutea), but the xanthophyll dissolves during tissue processing and is not present in histologic sections.</p>
			<p class="h2">Retinal Pigment Epithelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The RPE consists of a monolayer of hexagonal cells with apical microvilli and a basement membrane at the base of the cells. In contrast to the retina, the topographic variation of the RPE is subtle. In the macula, the RPE is taller, narrower, and more heavily pigmented, and it forms a regular hexagonal array. In the equatorial and midperipheral areas, RPE cells are larger in diameter and thinner. Variability in the diameter of RPE cells increases in the peripheral retina. The amount of cytoplasmic pigment, primarily lipofuscin, increases with age, particularly in the macular region.</p>

			<p class="h1">Congenital Anomalies</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Albinism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">albinism</span> refers to a congenital dilution of the pigment of the skin, the eyes, or both. This condition results from genetic mutations that cause abnormalities in the biosynthesis of melanin pigment. True albinism has been subdivided into <span class="italic">oculocutaneous albinism</span> and <span class="italic">ocular albinism.</span> Clinically, this distinction is somewhat helpful, but in reality all cases of ocular albinism have some degree of mild cutaneous involvement. The 2&#160;types of albinism do have a pathophysiologic difference: in oculocutaneous albinism, transmission is commonly autosomal recessive, and the amount of melanin in each melanosome is reduced; in ocular albinism, transmission is commonly X-linked recessive, and the number of melanosomes is reduced (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-3</span>). See BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> for further discussion of albinism.</p>
			<p class="h2">Myelinated Nerve Fibers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Generally, myelination of the nerve fibers in the optic pathways terminates at the lamina cribrosa. However, oligodendroglial cells in the NFL can produce a myelin sheath around nerve fibers in the retina (see Fig&#160;26-7 in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>). Though it is usually contiguous with the optic nerve head, myelination may also occur in isolation away from the optic nerve head and, if large, can produce a clinically significant scotoma. Myelinated nerve fibers have been associated with myopia, amblyopia, strabismus, and nystagmus.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Vascular Anomalies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">There are numerous congenital anomalies of the retinal vasculature, including cavernous hemangioma, parafoveal telangiectasia, and Coats disease. In Coats disease, exudative retinal detachment occurs as a result of leakage from abnormalities in the peripheral retina, including telangiectatic vessels, microaneurysms, and saccular dilations of retinal vessels (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-4</span>). Histologically, retinal detachments secondary to Coats disease are characterized by the presence of “foamy” macrophages and cholesterol crystals in the subretinal space.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retinal hemangioblastoma is a “vascular” tumor that may be observed in patients with von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) syndrome (see Chapter&#160;18 and BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous</span>). Histologically, retinal and optic nerve hemangioblastomas are similar to hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system. These tumors are composed of many abnormal, capillary-&#173;like, fenestrated channels surrounded by vacuolated, foamy stromal cells and reactive glial cells (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-5</span>). Loss of heterozygosity of the <span class="italic">VHL</span> gene has been clearly identified in the vacuolated stromal cells but not in the vascular endothelial or reactive glial cells of retinal and optic nerve hemangioblastomas. Thus, the vacuolated, foamy stromal cells are the actual tumor cells of retinal hemangioblastomas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> for further discussion of these vascular anomalies and their clinical features.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Congenital Hypertrophy of the RPE</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital hypertrophy of the RPE (CHRPE), a relatively common congenital lesion, is characterized clinically by a flat, black lesion that can vary in size from a few mm to 10&#160;mm in diameter (see Chapter&#160;17, Fig&#160;17-10). Frequently, central lacunae and a peripheral zone of less dense pigmentation appear within the lesion. This lesion is histologically characterized by enlarged RPE cells with densely packed and larger-than-&#173;normal, spherical melanin granules (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-6</span>). This benign congenital condition can generally be distinguished from choroidal nevi and melanoma on the basis of ophthalmoscopic features. In rare instances, adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the RPE may develop in an area of CHRPE. RPE lesions mimicking CHRPE may be present in Gardner syndrome, a subtype of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Histologic study of RPE changes in Gardner syndrome reveals that they are more consistent with hyperplasia of the RPE than with hypertrophy. The RPE changes in Gardner syndrome are probably more appropriately termed <span class="italic">hamartomas,</span> consistent with the loss of regulatory control of cell growth that results in other soft-&#173;tissue lesions in this syndrome. A mutation in the <span class="italic">APC</span> gene, which is linked to Gardner syndrome, gives a person an increased lifetime risk of developing colon polyps, benign tumors, and cancer.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Inflammations</p>
				<div id="Chapt11_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Infectious</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Viral</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Multiple viruses may cause retinal infections, including rubella, measles, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-&#173;zoster virus (VZV, or herpes zoster), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Two of the most frequent clinical presentations of retinal viral infection, acute retinal necrosis (ARN) and CMV retinitis, are discussed here.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Acute retinal necrosis</span> is a rapidly progressive, necrotizing retinitis caused by infection with HSV types&#160;1 and&#160;2, VZV, and, in rare instances, CMV. ARN can occur in healthy or immunocompromised individuals. The histologic findings include inflammation in the vitreous and anterior chamber, with a prominent obliterative retinal vasculitis and retinal necrosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-7</span>). Electron microscopy has demonstrated viral inclusions in retinal cells. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of aqueous or vitreous biopsy specimens can be used to rapidly demonstrate the viral cause of ARN, reducing the need for other diagnostic techniques such as viral culture, intraocular antibody analysis, or immunohistochemistry.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">CMV retinitis</span> is an opportunistic infection that occurs in immunosuppressed patients (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-8</span>). This infection is histologically characterized by retinal necrosis, which leads to a thin fibroglial scar with healing. Acute lesions show large neurons (20–30&#160;µm) that contain large eosinophilic intranuclear or intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. At the cellular level, CMV may infect vascular endothelial cells, retinal neurons, RPE, and macrophages.</p>
			<p class="h3">Bacterial</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See the discussion of endophthalmitis in Chapter&#160;10 and in BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Fungal</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fungal infections of the retina are uncommon, occurring most often in immunosuppressed patients and in patients with fungemia (eg, from parenteral nutrition or intravenous drug use). These infections usually begin as single or multiple foci of choroidal and retinal infection (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-9</span>). The most common causative fungi are <span class="italic">Candida</span> species, particularly <span class="italic">C.&#160;albicans.</span> Less common agents include <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> species and <span class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, fungal infections are characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. A central zone of necrosis is typically surrounded by granulomatous inflammation, and an outer layer of lymphocytes is common. With treatment, the lesions heal with a fibrous scar. Evaluation of histologic material may demonstrate a causative agent; however, culture and/or molecular studies are required for definitive identification of the organism.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Protozoal</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Toxoplasmosis</span> Ocular toxoplasmosis, which is the most common infectious retinitis, may occur because of reactivation of congenitally acquired disease or as the result of an acquired <span class="italic">Toxoplasma</span> infection in healthy or immunocompromised individuals. In patients with reactivated disease, ocular toxoplasmosis typically presents as a posterior uveitis or panuveitis with marked vitritis and focal retinochoroiditis adjacent to a pigmented chorioretinal scar. The absence of prior chorioretinal scarring suggests newly acquired disease. Microscopic examination of active toxoplasmic retinitis reveals necrosis of the retina, a prominent infiltrate of neutrophils and lymphocytes, and <span class="italic">Toxoplasma</span> organisms in the form of tissue cysts and tachyzoites (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-10</span>). There is generally a prominent lymphocytic infiltrate of the vitreous and the anterior segment and, not uncommonly, granulomatous inflammation in the inner choroid. Healing brings resolution of the inflammatory cell infiltrate with encystment of the organisms in the retina adjacent to the chorioretinal scar.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Noninfectious</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Noninfectious (autoimmune) inflammatory conditions involving the retina are discussed in BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Degenerations</p>
				<div id="Chapt11_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Typical and Reticular Peripheral Cystoid Degeneration and Retinoschisis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In <span class="italic">typical peripheral cystoid degeneration (TPCD),</span> which is a universal finding in the eyes of individuals older than 20&#160;years, cystic spaces develop in the outer plexiform layer of the retina. In <span class="italic">reticular peripheral cystoid degeneration (RPCD),</span> which is less common, the cystic spaces develop in the NFL, posterior to areas of TPCD (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-11</span>). Coalescence of the cystic spaces of TPCD forms <span class="italic">typical degenerative retinoschisis,</span> which is usually inferotemporal in location. In <span class="italic">reticular degenerative retinoschisis,</span> the splitting of retinal layers occurs in the NFL.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Lattice Degeneration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lattice degeneration (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-12</span>), which may be a familial condition, is found in up to 10% of the general population, but retinal detachment develops in only a small number of affected individuals. In contrast, lattice degeneration is seen in up to 40% of all rhegmatogenous detachments. The most important histologic features of lattice degeneration include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-9">discontinuity of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) of the retina</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">an overlying pocket of liquefied vitreous</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">focal sclerosis of retinal vessels, which remain physiologically patent</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">condensation and adherence of vitreous at the margins of the lesion</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">variable degrees of atrophy of the inner layers of the retina</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although atrophic holes often develop in the center of the lattice lesion, they are rarely the cause of retinal detachment; the vitreous is liquefied over the surface of the lattice, and thus no vitreous traction occurs. The retinal detachment associated with lattice degeneration is generally the result of vitreous adhesion at the margin of lattice degeneration, leading to retinal tears in this location with vitreous detachment. <span class="italic">Radial perivascular lattice degeneration</span> has the same histologic features as typical lattice degeneration but occurs more posteriorly along the course of retinal vessels.</p>
			<p class="h2">Paving-Stone Degeneration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In contrast to retinal vascular occlusion, which leads to inner retinal ischemia, occlusion of the choriocapillaris can lead to loss of the outer retinal layers and RPE. This type of atrophy, called <span class="italic">paving-&#173;stone</span> or <span class="italic">cobblestone degeneration,</span> is very common in the retinal periphery. The well-&#173;demarcated, flat, pale lesions seen clinically correspond to circumscribed areas of outer retinal and RPE atrophy and loss of the choriocapillaris, with adherence of the inner nuclear layer to Bruch membrane (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-13</span>). These histologic findings are similar to those found in geographic atrophy in age-&#173;related macular degeneration.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ischemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retinal ischemia can be caused by many conditions, including diabetes mellitus, retinal artery and vein occlusions, radiation retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, sickle cell retinopathy, vasculitis, and carotid occlusive disease. The specific aspects of some of these diseases are discussed later in this chapter. However, certain histologic findings are common to all the disorders that result in retinal ischemia. The retinal changes that result from ischemia can be divided into cellular responses and vascular responses.</p>
			<p class="h3">Retinal changes</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Cellular responses</span> The neurons in the retina are highly active metabolically, requiring large amounts of oxygen for production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (see also BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> Part&#160;IV, Biochemistry and Metabolism). This makes them highly sensitive to interruption of their blood supply. With prolonged oxygen deprivation (&gt;90&#160;minutes in experimental studies), the neuronal cell nuclei become pyknotic (ie, hyperchromatic and shrunken); they are subsequently phagocytosed, and they disappear. The extent and the location of atrophic retina resulting from ischemia depend on the size of the occluded vessel and on whether it is a retinal or a choroidal blood vessel. As described earlier, the retinal circulation supplies the inner retina, and the choroidal circulation supplies the outer retina and RPE. Infarctions of the retinal circulation lead to <span class="italic">inner ischemic retinal atrophy</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-14</span>), and infarctions of the choroidal circulation lead to <span class="italic">outer ischemic retinal atrophy</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-15</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The neuronal cells of the retina have no capacity for regeneration after ischemic damage. Following ischemic damage to the nerve fibers of the ganglion cells, <span class="italic">cytoid bodies</span> (swollen axons) become apparent histologically (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-16</span>). These are localized accumulations of axoplasmic material that are present in ischemic infarcts of the NFL. <span class="italic">Cotton-&#173;wool spots</span> are the clinical correlate of ischemic infarcts of the NFL; they resolve over 4–12&#160;weeks, leaving an area of inner ischemic retinal atrophy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Glial cells, like neurons, degenerate in areas of infarction. Glial cells may proliferate adjacent to local areas of infarction or in areas of ischemia without infarction, resulting in a glial scar.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Microglial cells are actually tissue macrophages rather than true glial cells. These cells are involved in the phagocytosis of necrotic cells, as well as of extracellular material, such as lipid or blood, that accumulates in areas of ischemia. Microglial cells are fairly resistant to ischemia.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="h4-head">Vascular responses</span> Many of the vascular changes in retinal ischemia are mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a potent stimulus of vascular permeability and angiogenesis.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Edema,</span> one of the earliest manifestations of retinal ischemia, is a result of transudation across the inner blood–retina barrier. Fluid and serum components accumulate in the extracellular space, and the fluid pockets are delimited by the surrounding neurons and glial cells, resulting in CME (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-17</span>; see also Fig&#160;5-3, Fig&#160;6-5C, and Fig&#160;6-12A in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous</span>). As previously mentioned, exudate accumulation in the outer plexiform layer of the macula (Henle layer) produces a star figure because of the orientation of the nerve fibers in this layer (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-18</span>). Histologically, retinal exudates appear as eosinophilic, sharply circumscribed spaces within the retina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-19</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intravitreally administered triamcinolone acetonide and biologic agents that inhibit VEGF (eg, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept) are employed in the treatment of various retinal diseases associated with macular edema and choroidal neovascularization. Improvement in vision, which is mostly secondary to a decrease in macular edema and subretinal fluid, has been demonstrated in studies in which these treatments were used for diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, and choroidal neovascularization (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-20</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retinal hemorrhages may also develop as a result of ischemic damage to the inner blood–retina barrier. As with edema and exudates, the shape of the hemorrhage conforms to the surrounding retinal tissue. Consequently, hemorrhages in the NFL are flame-shaped, whereas those in the nuclear or inner plexiform layers are circular, or “dot and blot” (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-21</span>). Subhyaloid hemorrhages have a boat-shaped configuration. White-&#173;centered hemorrhages <span class="italic">(Roth spots)</span> may be present in a number of conditions. The white centers of these hemorrhages can have a number of causes, including aggregates of white blood cells, platelets and fibrin, microorganisms, or neoplastic cells, or they may be due to retinal light reflexes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chronic retinal ischemia leads to architectural changes in the retinal vessels. The capillary bed becomes acellular in an area of vascular occlusion. Adjacent to acellular areas, dilated irregular vascular channels known as <span class="italic">intraretinal microvascular ab</span><span class="italic">normalities (IRMA)</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-22</span>; see also Fig&#160;11-19) and microaneurysms often appear (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-23</span>). <span class="italic">Microaneurysms</span> are fusiform or saccular outpouchings of the retinal capillaries best seen clinically with fluorescein angiography and histologically with trypsin digest preparations stained with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reagent (see Fig&#160;11-23). The density of <br />the endothelial cells that line the microaneurysms and IRMA is frequently variable. Microaneurysms evolve from being thin-walled and hypercellular to hyalinized and hypocellular.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some retinal ischemia cases, neovascularization of the retina and the vitreous may occur, most commonly in diabetes mellitus and central retinal vein occlusion. Retinal neovascularization arises from existing retinal blood vessels and penetrates the ILM, extending into the vitreous (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-24</span>). Hemorrhage may develop from retinal neovascularization as the vitreous exerts traction on the fragile new vessels.</p>
			<p class="h3">Specific ischemic retinal disorders</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Central and branch retinal artery and vein occlusions</span> <span class="italic">Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)</span> results from localized arteriosclerotic changes, an embolic event, and, in rare instances, vasculitis (as in temporal arteritis). As the retina becomes ischemic, it swells and loses its transparency. This swelling is best seen clinically and histologically in the posterior pole, where the NFL and the ganglion cell layer are thickest (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-25</span>). Because the ganglion cell layer and the NFL are thickest in the macula and absent in the fovea, the normal color of the choroid shows through in the fovea and produces a cherry-&#173;red spot, ophthalmoscopically suggesting CRAO. The retinal swelling eventually clears, leaving the classic histologic picture of inner ischemic retinal atrophy (see Fig&#160;11-14). Scarring and neovascularization following CRAO are rare.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO)</span> is usually the result of an embolus that lodges at the bifurcation of a retinal arteriole. <span class="italic">Hollenhorst plaques,</span> which are cholesterol emboli within retinal arterioles, seldom occlude the vessel. Emboli may be the first or most important clue to a significant systemic disorder such as carotid vascular disease (Hollenhorst plaques), cardiac valvular disease (calcific emboli), or thromboembolism (platelet-&#173;fibrin emboli).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The histology of the acute phase of BRAO is characterized by swelling of the inner retinal layers with early cell death. As the edema resolves, a classic picture emerges of inner ischemic atrophy in the distribution of the retina supplied by the occluded arteriole, with loss of cells in the NFL, ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, and inner nuclear layer (see Fig&#160;11-14). Arteriolar occlusions result in infarcts with complete postnecrotic atrophy of the affected layers.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)</span> occurs at the lamina cribrosa level. The pathophysiology of CRVO is the same as that of hemiretinal vein occlusion, but different from that of branch retinal vein occlusion (see the following discussion). CRVOs develop as a result of structural changes in the central retinal artery and the lamina cribrosa that lead to compression of the central retinal vein. This compression creates turbulent flow in the vein and predisposes to thrombosis. These structural changes occur in arteriosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CRVO is recognized clinically by the presence of retinal hemorrhages in all 4&#160;quadrants. Usually, prominent edema of the optic nerve head is observed, along with dilation and tortuosity of the retinal veins, variable numbers of cotton-&#173;wool spots, and macular edema. CRVO occurs in 2&#160;forms: a milder, perfused type and a more severe, nonperfused (ischemic) type.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Central Vein Occlusion Study (CVOS) defined <span class="italic">nonperfused CRVO</span> as a CRVO in which more than 10&#160;disc areas showed nonperfusion on fluorescein angiography. Nonperfused CRVOs typically have extensive retinal edema and hemorrhage, marked venular dilation, and numerous cotton-&#173;wool spots on ophthalmoscopic examination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Acute ischemic CRVO is characterized histologically by marked retinal edema, focal retinal necrosis, and extensive intraretinal hemorrhage. With long-&#173;standing CRVO, glial cells respond to the insult by replication and intracellular deposition of filaments <span class="italic">(gliosis).</span> The hemorrhage, hemosiderosis, disorganization of the retinal architecture, and gliosis seen in vein occlusions distinguish the final histologic picture from CRAO (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-26</span>). Following CRVO, numerous microaneurysms develop in the retinal capillaries, and acellular capillary beds are present to a variable degree. With time, dilated collateral vessels develop at the optic nerve head. Neovascularization of the iris is common following ischemic CRVO.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In <span class="italic">branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO),</span> occlusion of a tributary retinal vein occurs at the site of an arteriovenous crossing. At the crossing of a branch retinal artery and vein, the 2&#160;vessels share a common adventitial sheath. With arteriosclerotic changes in the arteriole, the retinal venule may become compressed, leading to turbulent flow, which predisposes the vessel to thrombosis. This condition is more common in patients with arteriosclerosis and hypertension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">BRVO leads to retinal hemorrhages and cotton-&#173;wool spots. Because BRVO does not always result in total inner retinal ischemia and death of all tissue, neovascularization is unlikely unless the ischemia is extensive (&gt;5&#160;disc diameters). Findings in eyes with permanent vision loss from BRVO include CME, retinal nonperfusion, macular edema with hard lipid exudates, late pigmentary changes in the macula, subretinal fibrosis, and epiretinal membrane formation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The histologic picture of BRVO resembles that of CRVO but is localized to the area of the retina in the distribution of the occluded vein. Inner ischemic retinal atrophy is a characteristic late histologic finding in both retinal arterial and venous occlusions (see Fig&#160;11-14). Numerous microaneurysms and dilated collateral vessels may be present. Acellular retinal capillaries are present to a variable degree, correlating with retinal capillary nonperfusion on fluorescein angiography.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dilated intraretinal telangiectatic vessels, or IRMA, may develop, as shown in Figures&#160;11-19 and 11-22, and neovascularization may follow (see Fig&#160;11-24). Intraretinal edema, hemorrhages, exudates, and microinfarcts of the NFL may develop secondary to the primary retinal vascular changes. Acutely, microinfarcts of the NFL (see Fig&#160;11-16) manifest as cotton-&#173;wool spots. Subsequently, focal inner ischemic atrophy appears (see Fig&#160;11-14).</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h4-head">Other histologic changes in diabetes mellitus</span> In diabetes mellitus, the corneal epithelial basement membrane thickens. This change is associated with inadequate adherence of the epithelium to the underlying Bowman layer, predisposing diabetic patients to corneal abrasions and poor corneal epithelial healing. Lacy vacuolation of the iris pigment epithelium (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-27</span>) occurs in association with hyperglycemia; histologically, the intraepithelial vacuoles contain glycogen, which is PAS-&#173;positive and diastase-&#173;sensitive. Thickening of the pigmented ciliary epithelial basement membrane (see Fig&#160;11-27) is almost universally present in diabetic eyes. The incidence of cataract formation is increased.</p>

			<p class="h2">Age-Related Macular Degeneration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of new blindness in the United States. Although the etiology of AMD remains unknown, evidence suggests that both genes and environmental factors play a role in its pathogenesis. Genome-&#173;wide and candidate association studies have identified risk loci for AMD and implicated certain genes, particularly <span class="italic">CFH</span> and <span class="italic">HTRA1/LOC387715/ARMS2.</span> Older age, tobacco use, positive family history, and cardiovascular disease increase the risk of AMD development. In addition, randomized clinical trials showing the benefit of antioxidant supplementation in AMD provide support for the role of oxidative stress in progression of the disease. See BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> for additional discussion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several characteristic changes in the retina, RPE, Bruch membrane, and choroid occur in AMD. The first detectable pathologic change is the appearance of deposits between the basement membrane of the RPE and the elastic portion of Bruch membrane (basal linear deposits) and similar deposits between the plasma membrane of the RPE and the basement membrane of the RPE (basal laminar deposits). Electron microscopy may be required to distinguish between these types of deposits; in advanced cases, the deposits may become confluent and visible with light microscopy without being clinically apparent (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-29</span>). This histologic appearance has been described as <span class="italic">diffuse drusen.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">The first clinically detectable feature of AMD is the appearance of drusen. The clinical term <span class="italic">drusen</span> has been correlated pathologically to large, extracellular PAS-&#173;positive deposits between the RPE and Bruch membrane. Histochemical and molecular/biologic analyses have demonstrated that the major constituents of human drusen include albumin, apolipoproteins, complement factors and related proteins, immunoglobulins, lipids, and amyloid-<span class="greek--tx-">b</span>. <span class="italic">Reticular pseudodrusen (RPD),</span> also known as <span class="italic">subretinal drusenoid deposits,</span> are extracellular material interposed between the photoreceptor inner/outer segments and the RPE; they may be associated with progression to advanced AMD (geographic atrophy and choroidal neovascularization). RPD contain membranous debris, unesterified cholesterol, complement factors and related proteins, and apolipoproteins but lack opsins. Many eyes with clinically apparent drusen (especially soft drusen) are found to have basal laminar and/or basal linear deposits and diffuse drusen on histologic analysis. Drusen, which may be transient, have been classified clinically as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-9"><span class="italic">hard (hyaline) drusen:</span> typical discrete, yellowish lesions that are PAS-&#173;positive nodules composed of hyaline material between the RPE and Bruch membrane (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-30</span>)</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Photoreceptor atrophy occurs to a variable degree in macular degeneration. This atrophy may be a primary abnormality of the photoreceptors or may be secondary to the underlying changes in the RPE, Bruch membrane, and choriocapillaris. In addition to photoreceptor atrophy, large zones of RPE atrophy may appear. When RPE atrophy occurs in the macular region, it is termed <span class="italic">geographic atrophy</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-33</span>). Drusen, photoreceptor atrophy, and RPE atrophy may all be present to varying degrees in <span class="italic">dry,</span> or <span class="italic">nonexudative, AMD.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">In eyes with choroidal neovascularization <span class="italic">(neovascular, wet,</span> or <span class="italic">exudative AMD),</span> fibrovascular tissue is present between the inner and outer layers of Bruch membrane, beneath the RPE, and/or in the subretinal space (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-34</span>). The new blood vessels leak fluid and may rupture easily, producing the exudative consequences of neovascular AMD, including macular edema, serous retinal detachment, and subretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages. VEGF inhibition achieved with intravitreally administered anti-&#173;VEGF agents has been shown to reduce the macular edema, slow the progression of the choroidal neovascularization, and improve the visual outcomes of patients with neovascular AMD (also see the previous section Vascular responses).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Choroidal neovascular membranes are classified as type&#160;1 or type&#160;2, based on their pathologic and clinical features. <span class="italic">Type&#160;1 neovascularization</span> (see Fig&#160;11-34A) is typically associated with the presence of basal laminar deposits and diffuse drusen and is characterized by neovascularization within Bruch membrane in the sub-RPE space. RPE atrophy and/or hyperplasia may be present overlying type&#160;1 neovascularization. <span class="italic">Type&#160;2 neovascularization</span> (see Fig&#160;11-34B) occurs in the subretinal space and generally features only a small defect in the RPE. Type&#160;1 neovascularization is more characteristic of AMD, whereas type&#160;2 is more characteristic of ocular histoplasmosis. Type&#160;2 membranes are more amenable to surgical removal than type&#160;1 membranes, because native RPE would be excised with a type&#160;1 membrane, leaving an atrophic lesion (without RPE) in the area of membrane excision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Though surgical excision is not routinely performed, surgically excised choroidal neovascular membranes (see Fig&#160;11-34B) are composed of vascular channels, RPE, and various other components of the RPE–Bruch membrane complex, including photoreceptor outer segments, basal laminar and linear deposits, and inflammatory cells.</p>

PCV occurs more frequently in men than women in Asian populations; the opposite is observed in whites. The majority of PCV lesions are located in the macular region in Asian cohorts, whereas peripapillary PCV lesions are more frequently observed in American and European cohorts.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fundus flavimaculatus and Stargardt disease are thought to represent 2&#160;ends of the spectrum of a disease process characterized by yellowish flecks at the RPE level, a generalized vermilion (reddish) color to the fundus on clinical examination, variable late RPE atrophy, a dark choroid on fluorescein angiography (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-37</span>; see also Figs&#160;12-7 and 12-8 in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous</span>), and gradually decreasing vision. The inheritance pattern is generally autosomal recessive, but autosomal dominant forms have been reported. Several genetic mutations have been observed in patients with a Stargardt-&#173;like phenotype, including the <span class="italic">ABCA4, STGD4, ELOVL4,</span> and <span class="italic">PRPH2 (peripherin&#160;2)</span> genes. Mutations in <span class="italic">ABCA4</span> are responsible for most cases of Stargardt disease. The <span class="italic">ABCA4</span> gene encodes a protein called RIM protein, which is a member of the ATP-&#173;binding cassette transporter family. This protein, which is expressed in the rims of rod and cone photoreceptor disc membranes, helps transport vitamin A derivatives to the RPE. The most striking feature of Stargardt disease revealed by light and electron microscopy is the marked engorgement of RPE cells (see Fig&#160;11-37D; see also Fig&#160;12-8 in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous</span>) with lipofuscin-&#173;like, PAS-&#173;positive material, with apical displacement of the normal RPE melanin granules.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Pattern dystrophies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">pattern dystrophies</span> refers to a heterogeneous group of inherited macular disorders that are characterized by varying patterns of pigment deposition in the macula at the RPE level. Recognized pattern dystrophies include butterfly-&#173;shaped pattern dystrophy (BPD), adult-&#173;onset foveomacular vitelliform dystrophy (AFMVD), reticular dystrophy, and fundus pulverulentus. BPD is characterized by a butterfly-&#173;shaped, irregular, depigmented lesion at the RPE level. AFMVD is characterized by the presence of slightly elevated, symmetric, round to oval, yellow lesions at the RPE level; these lesions are typically smaller than the vitelliform lesion characteristic of Best disease (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-38</span>). Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) reveals elevation of the photoreceptor layer, with localization of the dystrophic material between the photoreceptors and RPE (see Fig&#160;11-38C). The most common genetic mutation associated with the pattern dystrophies is in the <span class="italic">PRPH2 <br />(pe</span><span class="italic">ripherin&#160;2)</span> gene. Histologic studies reveal central loss of the RPE and photoreceptor cell layer, with a moderate number of pigment-&#173;containing macrophages in the subretinal space and outer neurosensory retina (see Fig&#160;11-38D). To either side, the RPE is distended with lipofuscin (see Fig&#160;11-38E). Basal laminar and linear deposits may be present throughout the macular region. The pathologic finding of pigment-&#173;containing cells with lipofuscin and drusen-like material in the subretinal space correlates clinically with the vitelliform appearance.

Only the most common diffuse photoreceptor dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, is discussed here.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) refers to a group of inherited retinal diseases that are characterized by photoreceptor and RPE dysfunction resulting in progressive visual field loss. The genetics of RP are complex; it can be sporadic, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. Mutations in the rhodopsin gene <span class="italic">(RHO)</span> are the most common cause of autosomal dominant RP. Ophthalmoscopic findings include pigment arranged in a bone spicule–like configuration around the retinal arterioles, arteriolar narrowing, and optic nerve head atrophy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-39A</span>). The disease is characterized primarily by the loss of rod photoreceptor cells via apoptosis. Cones are seldom directly affected by the identified mutations; however, they degenerate secondary to the loss of rods. The term <span class="italic">retinitis pigmentosa</span> is a misnomer, because clear evidence of inflammation is lacking. Microscopically, photoreceptor cell loss occurs, as well as RPE hyperplasia with migration into the retina around retinal vessels (Fig&#160;11-39B). The arterioles, though narrowed clinically, show no histologic abnormality initially. Later, thickening and hyalinization of the vessel walls appear. The optic nerve may show diffuse or sectoral atrophy, with gliosis as a late change.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-16">Pathogenesis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although retinoblastoma was once considered to be of glial origin (lesions clinically simulating retinoblastoma were formerly called <span class="italic">pseudogliomas</span>), the tumor’s neuroblastic origin from the nucleated layers of the retina has been well established. Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that tumor cells stain positive for neuron-&#173;specific enolase, rod outer segment photoreceptor–specific S-antigen, and rhodopsin. Tumor cells also secrete an extracellular substance known as <span class="italic">interphotoreceptor retinoid-&#173;binding protein,</span> which is also a product of normal photoreceptors. Retinoblastoma tumor cells grown in a culture have been shown to express a red and a green photopigment gene, as well as cone cell <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-subunits of transducin. These findings further support the concept that retinoblastoma may be a neoplasm of cone cell lineage. However, immunohistochemical and molecular studies cast some doubt on the hypothesis that a single cell type is the progenitor of retinoblastoma. The presence of small amounts of glial tissue within retinoblastoma suggests that resident glial cells may undergo reactive proliferation or become trapped within the tumor.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">retinoblastoma gene (RB1),</span> localized to the long arm of chromosome&#160;13, is deceptively named, as it does not actively cause retinoblastoma. The normal gene <span class="italic">suppresses</span> the development of retinoblastoma (and possibly other tumors, such as osteosarcoma). Retinoblastoma develops when both homologous loci of the suppressor gene become nonfunctional, either by a deletion error or by mutation. Although 1&#160;normal gene is sufficient to suppress the development of retinoblastoma, when 1&#160;normal gene and 1&#160;abnormal gene are present, the occurrence of a mutation in the normal gene may lead to loss of tumor suppression and allow retinoblastoma to develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Recently, it has been shown that amplification of the <span class="italic">MYCN</span> oncogene might initiate retinoblastoma in the presence of nonmutated <span class="italic">RB1</span> genes in up to 3% of unilateral retinoblastoma tumors. Genetic tests for mutations in the <span class="italic">RB1</span> gene are negative in these cases. This type of unilateral retinoblastoma is characterized by distinct histologic features (ie, undifferentiated cells with prominent and multiple nucleoli, necrosis, apoptosis, little calcification, absence of Flexner-&#173;Wintersteiner rosettes, and nuclear molding), only a few of the genomic copy number changes that are characteristic of retinoblastoma, and very early age (ie, median age of 4.5&#160;months) at diagnosis.</p>

			<p class="h3">Histologic features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Histologically, retinoblastoma consists of cells with round or oval nuclei that are approximately twice the size of a lymphocyte. Nuclei are hyperchromatic and surrounded by a scant amount of cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is usually high, although frequent apoptotic cells may make this difficult to assess. As tumors expand into the vitreous or subretinal space, they frequently outgrow their blood supply, creating a characteristic pattern of necrosis with the formation of pseudorosettes (viable tumor cells surrounding a blood vessel) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-40</span>); calcification is a common finding in areas of necrosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-41</span>). Cuffs of viable cells course along blood vessels; regions of ischemic necrosis begin 90–120&#160;µm from nutrient vessels. DNA released from necrotic cells may be detected within tumor vessels (see Fig&#160;11-41) and within blood vessels in tissues remote from the tumor, such as the iris. Neovascularization of the iris can complicate retinoblastoma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-42</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cells shed from retinoblastoma tumors remain viable in the vitreous and subretinal space, and may eventually develop into seeds throughout the eye. It may be difficult to determine histologically whether multiple intraocular foci of the tumor represent multiple primary tumors, implying systemic distribution of the abnormal gene, or tumor seeds (see Chapter&#160;19, Fig&#160;19-7).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The formation of highly organized <span class="italic">Flexner-&#173;Wintersteiner rosettes</span> is a characteristic feature of retinoblastoma that occurs only in rare cases in other neuroblastic tumors (eg, primitive neuroectodermal tumors). Flexner-&#173;Wintersteiner rosettes are expressions of retinal differentiation. The cells of these rosettes surround a central lumen lined by a refractile structure. This refractile lining corresponds to the external limiting membrane of the retina that represents sites of attachments between photoreceptors and Müller cells. The rosette is characterized by a single row of columnar cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and peripherally situated nuclei in a radial arrangement (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-43A</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A rosette without features of retinal differentiation, known as the <span class="italic">Homer Wright rosette,</span> can be found in other neuroblastic tumors, such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma, as well as in retinoblastoma. Unlike the Flexner-&#173;Wintersteiner rosette, a Homer Wright rosette has a center that is filled with a tangle of eosinophilic cytoplasmic processes (Fig&#160;11-43B).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Evidence of photoreceptor differentiation has also been documented for another flowerlike structure known as a <span class="italic">fleurette.</span> Fleurettes are curvilinear clusters of cells composed of rod and cone inner segments that are often attached to abortive outer segments (Fig&#160;11-43C). The fleurette expresses a greater degree of retinal differentiation than the Flexner-&#173;Wintersteiner rosette. In a typical retinoblastoma, the undifferentiated tumor cells greatly outnumber the fleurettes and Flexner-&#173;Wintersteiner rosettes, and differentiation is not an important prognostic indicator.</p>
			<p class="h3">Progression</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common route for a retinoblastoma tumor to spread from the eye is by way of the optic nerve. Direct infiltration of the optic nerve can lead to extension into the brain. Cells that spread into the leptomeninges can gain access to the subarachnoid space, with the potential for seeding throughout the central nervous system (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-44</span>). Invasion of the optic nerve is a poor prognostic sign (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-45</span>). See Chapter&#160;19 for a discussion of prognosis. High-risk histologic features associated with metastasis and survival include optic nerve invasion (laminar, retrolaminar, or cut margin), massive choroidal invasion, extraocular extension, and extensive tumor necrosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Massive choroidal invasion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-46</span>) is commonly defined as an invasive focus of tumor with a maximum diameter (in any dimension) measuring at least 3&#160;mm and tumor reaching at least the inner fibers of the scleral tissue. Focal choroidal invasion is defined as a tumor focus of less than 3&#160;mm in any dimension that does not reach the sclera. Spread to regional lymph nodes may be seen when a tumor involving the anterior segment grows into the conjunctival substantia propria, especially when the trabecular meshwork is involved.</p>

			<p class="h2">Retinocytoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retinocytoma is characterized histologically by numerous fleurettes admixed with individual cells that demonstrate varying degrees of photoreceptor differentiation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-47</span>). Retinocytoma should be differentiated from the spontaneous regression of retinoblastoma that is the end result of coagulative necrosis. See the discussion in Chapter&#160;19.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retinocytoma differs from retinoblastoma in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Retinocytoma cells have more cytoplasm and more evenly dispersed nuclear chromatin than retinoblastoma cells. Mitoses are not observed in retinocytoma.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-19">Although calcification may be identified in retinocytoma, necrosis is usually absent.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Medulloepithelioma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Medulloepithelioma is a congenital neuroepithelial tumor arising from primitive medullary epithelium (ie, the inner layer of the optic cup). This tumor usually occurs in the ciliary body but has also been documented in the retina and optic nerve. Clinically, medulloepithelioma may appear as a lightly pigmented or amelanotic cystic mass in the ciliary body, with erosion into the anterior chamber and iris root (see Chapter&#160;19, Fig&#160;19-12). Within the tumor, undifferentiated round to oval cells with little cytoplasm are organized into ribbonlike structures that have a distinct cellular polarity (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-48</span>). Cell nuclei are stratified in 3 to 5&#160;layers, and the entire structure is lined on one side by a thin basement membrane. One surface secretes a mucinous substance, rich in hyaluronic acid, that resembles primitive vitreous. Stratified sheets of cells are capable of forming mucinous cysts that are clinically characteristic. Homer Wright and Flexner-&#173;Wintersteiner rosettes may also be present.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Medulloepitheliomas that contain solid masses of neuroblastic cells indistinguishable from retinoblastoma are more difficult to classify. Medulloepitheliomas that have substantial numbers of undifferentiated cells with high mitotic rates and that demonstrate tissue invasion are considered malignant, although patients treated with enucleation have high survival rates, and “malignant” medulloepithelioma typically follows a relatively benign course if the tumor remains confined to the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Heteroplastic tissue, such as cartilage or smooth muscle, may be found in medulloepitheliomas. Tumors composed of cells from 2&#160;different embryonic germ layers are referred to as <span class="italic">teratoid medulloepitheliomas.</span> Malignant teratoid medulloepitheliomas demonstrate either solid areas of undifferentiated neuroblastic cells or sarcomatous transformation of heteroplastic elements. In rare cases, ciliary body medulloepithelioma presents in association with pleuropulmonary blastoma as part of a familial tumor predisposition syndrome; it may be secondary to a germline mutation in the <span class="italic">DICER1</span> gene.</p>

			<p class="h2">Fuchs Adenoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fuchs adenoma, an acquired tumor of the nonpigmented epithelium of the ciliary body, may be associated with sectoral cataract and may simulate other iris or ciliary body neoplasms. Fuchs adenomas consist of hyperplastic, nonpigmented ciliary epithelium arranged in sheets and tubules, with alternating areas of PAS-&#173;positive basement membrane material.</p>

			<p class="h2">Combined Hamartoma of the Retina and RPE</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A combined hamartoma of the retina and RPE is characterized clinically by the presence of a slightly elevated, variably pigmented mass that involves the RPE, peripapillary retina, optic nerve, and overlying vitreous (see Chapter&#160;17, Fig&#160;17-13). Frequently, a preretinal membrane that distorts the tumor’s inner retinal surface is present. The lesion is often diagnosed in childhood, supporting a probable hamartomatous origin, but it is possible that the vascular changes are primary, with secondary changes in the adjacent RPE.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, the tumor is characterized by thickening of the optic nerve head and peripapillary retina, with an increased number of blood vessels (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-49</span>). The RPE is hyperplastic and frequently migrates into the retina in a perivascular location. Vitreous condensation and fibroglial proliferation may be present on the surface of the tumor.</p>
			<p class="h2">Adenomas and Adenocarcinomas of the RPE</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neoplasia of the RPE is uncommon and is distinguished from hyperplasia of the RPE principally by the absence of a history of, or pathologic features suggesting, prior trauma or eye disease. <span class="italic">Adenomas</span> of the RPE typically retain characteristics of RPE cells, including basement membranes, cell junctions, and microvilli. <span class="italic">Adenocarcinomas</span> are distinguished from adenomas by greater anaplasia, mitotic activity, and invasion of the choroid or retina. Adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the RPE may rarely arise from CHRPE lesions. No metastases have ever been documented to occur in patients with RPE adenocarcinomas.</p>
