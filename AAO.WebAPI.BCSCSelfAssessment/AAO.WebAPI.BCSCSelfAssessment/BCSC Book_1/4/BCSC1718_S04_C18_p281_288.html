			<p class="h2-h1">Choroidal Hemangiomas</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hemangiomas of the choroid occur in circumscribed and diffuse forms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">circumscribed choroidal hemangioma</span> typically occurs in patients with no systemic disorders. This dome-shaped, often inconspicuous vascular hamartoma is generally located in the postequatorial fundus, often in the macular area (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-1A,&#160;B</span>). It may initially be difficult to distinguish from the surrounding fundus, but eventually degenerative changes occur in the overlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). These tumors also cause cystoid degeneration of the overlying outer retinal layers. In some cases, the tumors produce a secondary exudative retinal detachment that often extends into the foveal region, resulting in blurred vision and metamorphopsia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Circumscribed choroidal hemangioma may be difficult to diagnose, because it can resemble other choroidal lesions, including</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">amelanotic choroidal melanoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">choroidal osteoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">carcinoma metastatic to the choroid</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">granuloma of the choroid</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Ancillary diagnostic studies are helpful in evaluating both types of choroidal hemangiomas. A-scan ultrasonography shows a high-&#173;amplitude initial echo and high-&#173;amplitude broad internal echoes (high internal reflectivity; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-1C</span>). B-scan ultrasonography reveals localized or diffuse choroidal thickening with prominent internal reflections without choroidal excavation or acoustic shadowing. Optical coherence tomography shows minimal internal signal (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-1D</span>). Fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography reveal large choroidal vessels in the prearterial or arterial phases, with late staining of the tumor and late leakage or pooling in the cystoid spaces of the overlying retina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-1E–H</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Diffuse choroidal hemangioma</span> is generally seen in patients with Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome (ie, encephalofacial angiomatosis). It may also be associated with congenital ocular melanocytosis (ie, phakomatosis pigmentovascularis). This tumor produces diffuse reddish-&#173;orange coloration of the fundus, resulting in an ophthalmoscopic pattern referred to as <span class="italic">tomato ketchup fundus</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-2</span>). Secondary glaucoma and exudative retinal detachment often develop in eyes with this lesion. See also Chapter&#160;12 in this volume, BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> and Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Asymptomatic choroidal hemangiomas require no treatment. The most common indication for treatment is exudative detachment of the retina. Symptomatic circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas were traditionally managed with laser photocoagulation that created chorioretinal adhesions. However, photocoagulation was often unsuccessful and created scars. Recurrent detachments were common. The primary treatment of choice for symptomatic circumscribed choroidal hemangioma is photodynamic therapy (PDT).</p>
			<p class="body-text">PDT for circumscribed choroidal hemangioma is administered using the same standard parameters as PDT for exudative age-&#173;related macular degeneration. Most hemangiomas respond to PDT with resolution of the subretinal fluid and regression of the lesion, often with associated improvement in vision. However, cystoid macular edema may persist, and any degenerative changes in the overlying RPE may limit visual recovery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Low-dose radiation (most commonly 20&#160;gray [Gy]) via brachytherapy or radiotherapy (charged-particle, stereotactic, or external beam) has been successfully used to treat choroidal hemangiomas, including those unresponsive to PDT. All of these methods can be used to treat patients with circumscribed choroidal hemangioma; for diffuse choroidal hemangiomas, only external beam radiotherapy is used. Complications from the radiation and from the exudative retinal detachment may limit vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To date, there is little published evidence to support the use of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors to treat choroidal hemangiomas.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Retinal Angiomas</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Hemangioblastoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retinal hemangioblastoma (previously known as <span class="italic">angiomatosis retinae</span> and <span class="italic">retinal capillary hemangioma</span>) is a rare sporadic or autosomal dominant condition with a reported incidence of 1 in 40,000. Although retinal lesions may be present at birth, diagnosis is typically made in the second to third decades of life. Retinal hemangioblastomas may be solitary or multiple; they appear as red to orange tumors arising within the retina with large-&#173;caliber, tortuous afferent and efferent retinal blood vessels (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-3A,&#160;B</span>). Associated yellow-&#173;white retinal and subretinal lipid exudates that often involve the fovea may appear. Exudative detachments often occur in eyes with hemangioblastomas. Atypical variations include tumors arising from the optic nerve head (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-3C</span>) and in the retinal periphery, where vitreous traction may elevate the tumor from the surface of the retina. Fluorescein angiography, which is not needed for diagnosis, demonstrates a rapid arteriovenous transit (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-3D</span>), with immediate filling of the feeding arteriole, subsequent filling of the numerous fine blood vessels that constitute much of the tumor, and drainage by the dilated venule. Massive leakage of dye into the tumor and vitreous can occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When a hemangioblastoma of the retina occurs as the only finding, the condition is generally known as <span class="italic">von Hippel disease.</span> This condition is familial in about 20% of cases and bilateral in about 50%. The lesions may be multiple.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If retinal hemangioblastomas are associated with a cerebellar or spinal hemangioblastoma, then the condition is called <span class="italic">von Hippel–Lindau syndrome.</span> The gene for von Hippel–Lindau syndrome has been isolated to chromosome&#160;3. A number of other tumors and cysts may develop in patients with this syndrome; the most serious of these lesions are renal cell carcinoma and pheochromocytoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When von Hippel–Lindau syndrome is suspected, appropriate genetic consultation and screening are critical for long-term follow-&#173;up of ocular manifestations and systemic complications. Patients with this syndrome can now undergo genetic screening that determines whether they are at risk for developing systemic manifestations of the disease. By identifying the retinal lesions, the ophthalmologist is often the first medical specialist to identify affected family members. Screening for systemic vascular anomalies (eg, cerebellar hemangioblastomas) and malignancies may reduce mortality, and aggressive screening for and early treatment of retinal hemangioblastomas may reduce complications and improve long-term visual outcomes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The treatment of retinal hemangioblastomas includes photocoagulation for smaller lesions; cryotherapy for larger and more peripheral lesions; and either plaque brachytherapy or proton beam radiotherapy or scleral buckling with cryotherapy for larger lesions with more extensive retinal detachment. Both standard and modified PDT protocols have been successfully used to treat selected retinal hemangioblastomas. The use of VEGF inhibitors in the treatment of retinal hemangioblastomas is still experimental. Reports suggest that the principal efficacy of VEGF inhibitors is in reducing macular edema, but the impact <br />on the size of the hemangioblastomas has been variable. Although most optic nerve head hem&#173;angioblastomas are notoriously resistant to treatment, some have responded to the same conservative therapies used on peripheral lesions, or have been resected using vitrectomy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The visual prognosis remains guarded for patients with optic nerve head and large retinal lesions.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Cavernous hemangioma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cavernous hemangioma of the retina is an uncommon lesion that resembles a cluster of grapes (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-4</span>). These lesions may also occur on the optic nerve head. Retinal cavernous hemangiomas may be associated with similar skin and central nervous system lesions. Patients that have intracranial lesions may experience associated seizures. Unlike retinal hemangioblastomas, cavernous hemangiomas are not typically associated with exudation, and therefore treatment is rarely required. However, small hemorrhages as well as gliotic and fibrotic areas may appear on the surface of the lesion. Fluorescein angiography may reveal plasma–erythrocyte separation within the vascular spaces of the cavernous hemangioma; this separation is virtually diagnostic of these lesions. In contrast to retinal hemangioblastomas, retinal cavernous hemangiomas fill very slowly. The fluorescein remains in the vascular spaces for an extended period without apparent leakage (see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> Fig&#160;7-12).</p>

			<p class="h1">Arteriovenous Malformations</p>
			<div id="Chapt18_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital retinal arteriovenous malformation (also known as racemose hemangioma) is an anomalous artery-to-&#173;vein anastomosis that can range from a small, localized vascular communication in the iris, near the optic nerve head or in the retinal periphery to a prominent tangle of large, tortuous blood vessels throughout most of the fundus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-5A,&#160;B</span>). <span class="italic">Racemose</span> refers to the clustered or bunched nature of the vessels. When associated with an arteriovenous malformation of the midbrain region, this condition is generally referred to as <span class="italic">Wyburn-&#173;Mason syndrome</span> (also known as Bonnet-Dechaume-&#173;Blanc syndrome; see BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> and Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>). Associated similar arteriovenous malformations may appear in the orbit and mandible.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A racemose hemangioma of the retina is different from a congenital retinal macrovessel, which is a large aberrant retinal vessel that crosses the midline and often also the macular area (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;18-5C,&#160;D</span>). Retinal macrovessels occasionally show arteriovenous communications.</p>
