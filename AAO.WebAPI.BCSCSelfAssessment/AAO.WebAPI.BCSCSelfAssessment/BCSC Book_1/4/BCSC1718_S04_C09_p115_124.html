			<p class="chapter-title">Lens</p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Topography</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The crystalline lens is a soft, elastic, avascular, biconvex structure that measures approximately 9–10&#160;mm in diameter and 5&#160;mm anteroposteriorly in the adult eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-1</span>). The lens is derived from surface ectoderm. See BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract,</span> for discussion of the structure, embryology, and pathology of the lens.</p>
			<p class="h2">Capsule</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The capsule, which surrounds the entire lens, is a thick basement membrane elaborated by lens epithelial cells and is composed partly of type&#160;IV collagen fibers (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-2</span>). The lens capsule is thickest anteriorly (12–21&#160;µm) and peripherally near the equator and thinnest posteriorly (2–9&#160;µm) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-3</span>). The zonular fibers insert into the capsule, which also has an important role in molding the lens shape for accommodation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Epithelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens epithelium is derived from the cells of the original lens vesicle that did not differentiate into primary lens fibers. The anterior or axial lens epithelium forms a single layer of cuboidal cells; these cells’ basilar surface is oriented toward the anterior lens capsule. In contrast, the equatorial, mitotically active cells appear more elongated as they differentiate into lens fibers. Epithelial cells are not typically observed posterior to the lens equator (see Fig&#160;9-2).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Cortex and Nucleus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The center of the lens contains the oldest lens fibers, the <span class="italic">embryonic and fetal lens nucleus,</span> whereas the outer cortical fibers are derived from postnatally differentiated lens epithelial cells. As the lens epithelial cells differentiate, new lens fibers are continuously laid down from the outside. In the equatorial region, termed the <span class="italic">equatorial lens bow,</span> the lens epithelial cells move centrally, elongate, produce crystallins, lose organelles, and transform into cortical lens fibers. Clinically and histologically, the demarcation between the nucleus and cortex is not well defined (see Fig&#160;9-2).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The overall shape of the lens changes over the first decade of life; with increasing age, the diameter of the lens nucleus and cortex increases from anterior to posterior.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Zonular Fibers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens is supported by zonular fibers that attach to the anterior and posterior lens capsule in the midperiphery (see Chapter&#160;7, Fig&#160;7-7). These fibers hold the lens in place through their attachments to the ciliary body processes. They are composed of an elastic type of glycoprotein known as fibrillin.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Congenital Anomalies</p>
				<div id="Chapt9_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> and Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract,</span> for discussion of lens coloboma, ectopia lentis, and congenital cataract, as well as additional discussion of the following topics.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Congenital Aphakia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital aphakia is a rare anomaly that can be subdivided into 2&#160;forms: primary and secondary. In primary congenital aphakia, the lens is absent histologically. Primary congenital aphakia results from failed induction of the surface ectoderm during embryogenesis and has been associated with homozygous mutations in the <span class="italic">FOXE3</span> gene and severe ocular and systemic developmental anomalies. The histologic findings of secondary congenital aphakia depend on the underlying etiology. In secondary congenital aphakia, the lens has developed but has been resorbed or extruded before or during birth. This form of aphakia is often associated with congenital infections such as rubella.</p>
			<p class="h2">Anterior Lenticonus and Lentiglobus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The anterior surface of the lens can assume an abnormal shape, either conical <span class="italic">(lenticonus)</span> or spherical <span class="italic">(lentiglobus).</span> Clinically, an “oil droplet” red reflex is present in both conditions. Anterior lenticonus may be unilateral or bilateral. Histologic examination reveals thinning of and dehiscences in the anterior lens capsule, a decrease in the number of anterior lens epithelial cells, and bulging of the anterior cortex. Ultrastructurally, alterations of lens capsule collagen and immunohistochemical abnormalities in type&#160;IV collagen have been observed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Bilateral anterior lenticonus is usually associated with <span class="italic">Alport syndrome,</span> which is typically an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by hemorrhagic nephritis, deafness, anterior polar cataract, retinal flecks, and retinal and iris neovascularization. Mutations in type&#160;IV collagen genes have been described in some forms of Alport syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h2">Posterior Lenticonus (Lentiglobus)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Posterior lenticonus is characterized by a spherical deformity of the posterior surface of the lens (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-4</span>). This condition usually occurs as a sporadic, unilateral anomaly and is associated with congenital cataract. Other, rare ocular associations include microphthalmos, microcornea, persistent anterior hyaloid vasculature, and uveal colobomas. Posterior lenticonus may also be a manifestation of Alport syndrome (due to mutations in the <span class="italic">COL4A3–5</span> genes) or <span class="italic">oculocerebrorenal syndrome (Lowe syndrome</span><span class="italic">)</span><span class="italic">,</span> an X-linked condition characterized by systemic acidosis, renal rickets, hypotonia, and congenital cataracts, which histologically display focal, internally directed excrescences of the lens capsule. This syndrome may be due to mutations in the <span class="italic">OCRL1</span> gene.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Inflammations</p>
				<div id="Chapt9_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Phacoantigenic Uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Also known as <span class="italic">phacoanaphylactic endophthalmitis</span> or <span class="italic">lens-&#173;induced granulomatous endo</span><span class="italic">ph&#173;thalmitis,</span> phacoantigenic uveitis is a type of lens-&#173;induced intraocular inflammation. It is thought to be precipitated by the deposition of antigen–antibody complexes (type&#160;III Arthus-&#173;type reaction) that form following exposure of the immune system to lens antigens after violation of the lens capsule. The inflammation may follow accidental or surgical trauma to the lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, an eye with phacoantigenic uveitis shows a central nidus of degenerating lens material surrounded by concentric layers of inflammatory cells <span class="italic">(zonal granuloma).</span> Multinucleated giant cells and neutrophils are present within the inner layer adjacent to the degenerating lens material. Lymphocytes and plasma cells make up the intermediate mantle of cells. These cells may be surrounded by fibrovascular connective tissue, depending on the duration of the inflammatory response (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-5</span>). See also BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span></p>
			<p class="h2"><span class="h2--emph-">Propionibacterium acnes</span> Endophthalmitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chronic postoperative endophthalmitis caused by <span class="italic">P&#160;acnes</span> may have a delayed presentation following cataract surgery, usually 2&#160;months to 2&#160;years later. Histologic examination of the lens capsule reveals sequestration of the bacteria (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-6</span>).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Degenerations</p>
				<div id="Chapt9_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Cataract and Other Abnormalities</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Capsule</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mild thickening of the lens capsule can be associated with pathologic proliferation of lens epithelium or with chronic inflammation of the anterior segment. Elements with an affinity for basement membranes, such as copper or silver, can form pigmented deposits in the anterior lens capsule, conditions known as chalcosis and argyrosis, respectively.</p>
			<p class="h3">Epithelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Severe elevation of intraocular pressure can injure the lens epithelial cells, leading to cell degeneration. Clinically, patches of white flecks <span class="italic">(glaukomflecken)</span> are observed beneath the lens capsule. Histologic examination shows focal areas of necrotic lens epithelial cells beneath the anterior lens capsule. Associated degenerated subepithelial cortical material is also present. See also BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Inflammation, ischemia, or trauma can also cause injury to the lens epithelium, stimulating epithelial metaplasia and the formation of <span class="italic">anterior subcapsular fibrous plaques</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-7A</span>). In this situation, the epithelial cells have undergone a metaplastic transformation into fibroblast-&#173;like cells that are capable of producing collagen. Following resolution of the inciting stimulus, the lens epithelium may produce another capsule, thereby completely surrounding the fibrous plaque and creating a <span class="italic">duplication cataract</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-7B</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retention of iron-&#173;containing metallic foreign bodies in the eye may cause lens epithelial degeneration as a result of <span class="italic">siderosis.</span> The presence of iron within the epithelial cells can be demonstrated with Perls Prussian blue stain.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common abnormality involving the lens epithelium may be <span class="italic">posterior subcapsular cataract</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-8A;</span> see also Fig&#160;9-7A). Histologically, development of this cataract begins with epithelial disarray at the equator, followed by posterior migration of the lens epithelium along the capsule. As the cells migrate posteriorly, they may enlarge to 5–6&#160;times their normal size. These swollen cells, referred to as <span class="italic">Wedl</span> or <span class="italic">bladder cells,</span> can cause significant visual impairment if they involve the axial portion of the lens (Fig&#160;9-8B).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Disruption of the lens capsule often results in proliferation of lens epithelial cells. For example, following extracapsular cataract extraction, remaining epithelial cells can proliferate and cover the inner surface of the posterior lens capsule, resulting in clinically appreciable posterior capsule opacification. These accumulations of proliferating epithelial cells may form partially transparent globular masses, called <span class="italic">Elschnig pearls</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-9</span>), which are histologically identical to Wedl cells. Sequestration of proliferating lens fibers in the equatorial region may create a doughnut-&#173;shaped configuration that is referred to as a <span class="italic">So</span><span class="italic">emmering ring lens remnant</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-10</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Cortex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinically, cortical degenerative changes fall into 2&#160;broad categories: (1)&#160;generalized discolorations with loss of transparency and (2)&#160;focal opacifications. Generalized loss of transparency cannot reliably be diagnosed histologically; the histologic stains used to colorize the lens after it is processed prevent the assessment of lens clarity. The earliest sign of focal cortical degeneration is hydropic swelling of the lens fibers with decreased intensity of eosinophilic staining. Focal cortical opacities become more apparent when fiber degeneration is advanced enough to cause liquefactive change. Light microscopy shows the accumulation of eosinophilic globules <span class="italic">(morgagnian globules)</span> in slitlike spaces between the lens fibers (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-11</span>; see Fig&#160;9-12C). As focal cortical lesions pro&#173;gress, the slitlike spaces become confluent, forming globular collections of lens protein. <br />Ultimately, the entire cortex can become liquefied, allowing the nucleus to sink downward and the capsule to wrinkle; this condition is referred to as <span class="italic">morgagnian cataract</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-12</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Denatured lens protein can escape through an intact lens capsule and provoke an anterior chamber macrophagic inflammatory reaction, a condition known as <span class="italic">phaco&#173;lytic </span><span class="italic">glaucoma.</span> See Chapter&#160;7 for a brief discussion of this topic, as well as BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Nucleus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the adult lens, the continual production of lens fibers subjects the nucleus to the stress of mechanical compression, which causes hardening of the lens nucleus. Aging is also associated with alterations in the chemical composition of the nuclear fibers. The pathogenesis of nuclear discoloration is poorly understood and probably involves more than 1&#160;mechanism, including accumulation of urochrome pigment. Clinically, the lens nucleus may appear yellow, brunescent, or deep brown.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nuclear cataracts are difficult to assess histologically because they take on a subtle homogeneous eosinophilic appearance. Clinically, the loss of cellular laminations (artifactitious clefts) probably correlates better with nuclear firmness than it does with optical opacification (see Fig&#160;9-12C). Occasionally, crystalline deposits, identified as calcium oxalate, may be observed within a nuclear cataract (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-13</span>). These deposits are birefringent under polarized light.</p>
			<p class="h3">Zonular fibers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Deposition of protein on the lens zonular fibers in <span class="italic">pseudoexfoliation syndrome</span> (also called <span class="italic">exfoliation syndrome</span>) can lead to degeneration of the zonular fibers and their eventual dehiscence. See Chapter&#160;7 in this volume for additional discussion.</p>
