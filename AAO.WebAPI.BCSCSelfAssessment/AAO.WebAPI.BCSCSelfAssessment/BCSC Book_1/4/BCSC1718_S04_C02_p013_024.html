			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">General Aspects of Wound Repair</p>
				<div id="Chapt2_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Wound healing, though a common physiologic process, requires a complicated sequence of tissue events. The purpose of wound healing is to restore the anatomical and functional integrity of an organ or tissue as quickly and perfectly as possible. The process may take many months, and the end result is typically a scar (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-1</span>). A series of responses occurs following a wound:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2">The <span class="italic">acute inflammatory phase</span> may last from minutes to hours. Blood clots quickly in adjacent vessels in response to tissue activators. Neutrophils and fluid enter the extravascular space. <span class="italic">Macrophages</span> remove debris from the damaged tissues, new vessels form, and fibroblasts begin to produce collagen.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Regeneration,</span> the replacement of lost cells, occurs only in tissues composed of cells capable of undergoing mitosis throughout life (eg, epithelial cells, fibroblasts). <span class="italic">Repair</span> is the process of restructuring of tissues that leads to a fibrous scar.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">In the final phase, <span class="italic">contraction</span> causes the reparative tissues to shrink so that the scar is smaller than the surrounding uninjured tissues.</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Healing in Specific Ocular Tissues</p>
				<div id="Chapt2_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Wound healing has variable mechanisms and consequences in different ocular tissues. The processes summarized in the following sections are also discussed in other volumes of the BCSC; to find more information on a particular topic, consult the <span class="italic">Master Index.</span> Also see the appropriate chapters in this volume for a specific topography.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Cornea</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A corneal <span class="italic">abrasion,</span> or corneal (epithelial) erosion, refers to a wound that is limited to the surface corneal epithelium, although Bowman layer and superficial stroma may also be involved. Within an hour of injury, the parabasilar epithelial cells begin to migrate across the denuded area until they touch other migrating cells; then <span class="italic">contact inhibition</span> stops further migration. Simultaneously, the surrounding basal cells undergo mitosis to supply additional cells to cover the defect. Although a large corneal abrasion is usually covered by migrating epithelial cells within 24–48&#160;hours, complete healing, which includes restoration of the full thickness of epithelium (5–7&#160;layers) and re-&#173;formation of the anchoring fibrils, takes 4–6&#160;weeks. If a thin layer of anterior corneal stroma is lost with the abrasion, epithelium will fill the shallow crater, forming a facet.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal stromal healing is avascular. Healing in the corneal stroma occurs via the process of fibrosis rather than the fibrovascular proliferation seen in other tissues (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-2</span>). The avascular aspect of corneal wound healing is critical to the success of penetrating keratoplasty as well as the various forms of refractive surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Following a central corneal wound, neutrophils arrive at the site via the tears (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-3</span>), and the edges of the wound swell. Serum-&#173;derived healing factors are not present. The corneal matrix glycosaminoglycans, keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, disintegrate at the edge of the wound. The stromal keratocytes, fibroblast-&#173;like cells (also known as fibrocytes), are activated and eventually migrate across the wound, laying down collagen and fibronectin. The direction of the keratocytes and collagen is not parallel to the stromal lamellae. Hence, cells are directed anteriorly and posteriorly across a wound that will always be visible microscopically as an irregularity in the stroma and clinically as an opacity. If the wound edges are not well-&#173;apposed, the gap will not be completely filled by the proliferating keratocytes, resulting in focal stromal thinning.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Both the epithelium and the endothelium are critical to good central wound healing. If the epithelium does not cover the wound within days, the subjacent stromal healing will be limited, and the wound will be weak. Growth factors from the epithelium stimulate and sustain healing. The endothelial cells adjacent to the wound slide across the posterior cornea; a few cells are replaced through mitosis. The endothelium lays down a new thin layer of Descemet membrane. If the internal aspect of the wound is not covered by Descemet membrane, stromal fibrocytes may continue to proliferate into the anterior chamber as fibrous ingrowth, or the posterior wound may permanently remain open. In the late months of healing, the initial fibrillar collagen is replaced by stronger collagen. Bowman layer is not replaced when it is incised or destroyed. For example, the surface of a healed ulceration is covered by epithelium, but little of its lost stroma is replaced by fibrous tissue.</p>
			<p class="h2">Sclera</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The sclera differs from the cornea in that its collagen fibers are randomly distributed rather than laid down in orderly lamellae, and dermatan sulfate is its glycosaminoglycan. The sclera is relatively avascular and hypocellular. When stimulated by wounding, the episclera migrates into the scleral wound, supplying vessels, fibroblasts, and activated macrophages. The final wound contracts, creating a puckered appearance. If the adjacent uvea is damaged, uveal fibrovascular tissue may enter the scleral wound, resulting in a scar with dense adhesion between the uvea and the sclera. Indolent episcleral fibrosis produces a dense coat around an extrascleral foreign body such as an encircling scleral buckling element or a glaucoma tube shunt. Because the wound healing processes in the cornea and sclera are relatively avascular, the tensile strength of wounds is less than that of the native, undisturbed tissue. In certain clinical situations, modifying the healing process through the use of topical chemotherapy, such as 5-fluorouracil or mitomycin&#160;C, or via collagen cross-&#173;linking, may be desirable (see BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> Chapter&#160;8).</p>
			<p class="h2">Uvea</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In most circumstances, wounds of the iris do not stimulate a healing response in either the stroma or the epithelium. Though richly endowed with blood vessels and fibroblasts, the iris stroma does not produce granulation tissue to close a defect. In some circumstances, the pigmented epithelium may be stimulated to migrate, but that migration is usually limited to the subjacent surface of the lens capsule, where subsequent adhesion of epithelial cells occurs (posterior synechia). When fibrovascular tissue forms, it usually does so on the anterior surface of the iris as a neovascular membrane that may cover iridectomy or pupillary openings. This fibrovascular tissue may arise from the iris, the chamber angle, or the peripheral cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The stroma and melanocytes of the ciliary body and choroid do not regenerate after injury. Macrophages remove debris, and a thin fibrous scar, which appears white and atrophic clinically, develops.</p>

			<p class="h2">Lens</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Small tears in the anterior lens capsule are sealed by nearby lenticular epithelial cells. In circumstances that make the lenticular epithelium anoxic or hypoxic, such as posterior synechiae or markedly elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), a metaplastic response may occur, producing fibrous plaques intermixed with basement membrane.</p>
			<p class="h2">Retina</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The retina is made of terminally differentiated cells that typically do not regenerate when injured. Because the retina is part of the CNS, glial cells (eg, Müller cells, fibrous astrocytes), rather than fibroblasts, proliferate in response to retinal trauma. Surgical techniques to close openings in the neurosensory retina are successful when the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are intentionally injured (eg, as a result of cryotherapy, photocoagulation) forming an adhesive, atrophic scar (see Chapter&#160;11, Fig&#160;11-28). Adhesion between the neurosensory retina and Bruch membrane develops according to the size of the original wound and the type of injury. The internal limiting membrane (ILM) and Bruch membrane provide the architectural planes for glial scarring; adhesions from the ILM to Bruch membrane may incorporate a rare residual glial cell, and variable numbers of retinal and RPE cells may be present between the membranes. If the wound has damaged Bruch membrane, choroidal fibroblasts and vessels may participate in the formation of the final scar. The end result is a metaplastic fibrous or fibrovascular plaque in the sub–neurosensory retina and sub-RPE areas. The RPE usually undergoes hyperplasia in such scars, causing the dense black clumps seen clinically in scars of the fundus.</p>
			<p class="h2">Vitreous</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vitreous has few cells and no blood vessels. However, the collagen fibrils of the vitreous can provide a scaffold for glial and fibrovascular tissue from the retina and uveal tract to grow and extend into the vitreous to proliferate as membranes. These membranes usually have a contractile component, which can lead to retinal traction.</p>
			<p class="h2">Eyelid, Orbit, and Lacrimal Tissues</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The rich blood supply to the skin of the eyelids supports rapid healing. Approximately the third day after an injury to the skin, myofibroblasts derived from vascular pericytes migrate around the wound and actively contract, decreasing the size of the wound. The eyelid and orbit are compartmentalized by intertwining fascial membranes that enclose muscular, tendinous, fatty, lacrimal, and ocular tissues; these tissues can become distorted by scarring. Exuberant contraction distorts the muscle action, producing dysfunctional scars. The striated muscles of the orbicularis oculi and extraocular muscles are made of terminally differentiated cells that do not regenerate, but the viable cells may hypertrophy.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Histologic Sequelae of Ocular Trauma</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Rupture of Descemet membrane</span> may occur after minor trauma (eg, in keratoconus; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-4</span>) or major trauma (eg, after forceps injury; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The anterior chamber angle structures, especially the trabecular beams, are vulnerable to distortion of the anterior globe. <span class="italic">Traumatic recession of the anterior chamber angle</span> occurs when there is a tear in the ciliary body between the longitudinal and circular muscles with posterior displacement of the iris root (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-6</span>). Concurrent damage to the trabecular meshwork may lead to glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cyclodialysis</span> results from disinsertion of the longitudinal muscle of the ciliary body from the scleral spur (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-7</span>). This condition can lead to hypotony because the aqueous of the anterior chamber now has free access to the suprachoroidal space; in addition, because the blood supply to the ciliary body is diminished, the production of aqueous is decreased.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The uveal tract is attached to the sclera at 3&#160;points: the scleral spur, the internal ostia of the vortex veins, and the peripapillary tissue. This anatomical arrangement is the basis <br />of the evisceration technique and explains the vulnerability of the eye to expulsive choroidal hemorrhage. The borders of a dome-shaped suprachoroidal hemorrhage are defined by the position of the vortex veins and the scleral spur (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">An <span class="italic">iridodialysis</span> is a tear in the iris at the thinnest portion of the diaphragm, the iris root, where it inserts into the supportive tissue of the ciliary body (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-9</span>). Only a small amount of supporting tissue surrounds the iris sphincter. If that sphincter muscle is torn, the contraction of the remaining muscle will create a notch at the pupillary border.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">Vossius ring</span> appears when iris pigment epithelial cells are compressed against the anterior surface of the lens, depositing a ring of melanin pigment concentric with the pupil.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the lens capsule is disrupted, a <span class="italic">cataract</span> may form immediately. The capsule is thinnest at the posterior pole, the point farthest away from the lens epithelial cells. The epithelium of the lens may be stimulated by trauma to form an anterior fibrous plaque just inside the capsule. The lens zonular fibers are points of relative weakness; if they rupture, lens displacement occurs, either partial (subluxation) or complete (luxation). Focal areas of zonular rupture may allow formed vitreous to enter the anterior chamber.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Commotio retinae</span> (Berlin edema) often complicates blunt trauma to the eye. Although it is most prominent in the macula, commotio retinae can affect any portion of the retina. The retinal opacification seen clinically results from disruption in the architecture of the inner and outer segments of the photoreceptors.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Retinal dialysis</span> is most likely to develop in the inferotemporal or superonasal quadrant. The retina is anchored anteriorly to the nonpigmented epithelium of the pars plana. This union is reinforced by the attachment of the vitreous base, which straddles the ora serrata. Deformation of the eye can result in a circumferential retinal tear at the point of attachment of the ora serrata or immediately posterior to the point of attachment of the vitreous base (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-10</span>). The interface between necrotic and normal neurosensory retina is also vulnerable to retinal tears.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After a penetrating injury, intraocular <span class="italic">fibrocellular proliferation</span> may occur. This proliferation may lead to vitreous/subretinal/choroidal hemorrhage; tractional retinal detachment; proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), including anterior PVR (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-11</span>); hypotony; and phthisis bulbi (discussed later). Formation of proliferative intraocular membranes may affect the timing of vitreoretinal surgery. Sequelae of intraocular hemorrhage include hemosiderosis bulbi, cholesterolosis, and hemoglobin spherulosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Rupture of Bruch membrane</span> or a <span class="italic">choroidal rupture</span> may occur after direct or indirect injury to the globe. Choroidal neovascularization, granulation tissue proliferation, and scar formation may occur in areas where the choroid has ruptured or where there are disruptions in Bruch membrane. A subset of direct choroidal ruptures, those usually occurring after a projectile injury, may result in <span class="italic">focal posttraumatic choroidal granulomatous inflammation</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-12</span>). This inflammation may be related to foreign material introduced into the choroid. A chorioretinal rupture and necrosis is known as <span class="italic">chorioretinitis sclopetaria.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Phthisis bulbi</span> is defined as atrophy, shrinkage, and disorganization of the eye and intraocular contents. Not all eyes rendered sightless by trauma become phthisical. If the nutritional status of the eye and near-&#173;normal IOP are maintained during the repair process, the globe will remain clinically stable. However, blind eyes are at high risk for repeated trauma with cumulative destructive effects. Slow, progressive functional decompensation may also prevail. Many blind eyes pass through several stages of atrophy and disorganization before progressing to the end stage of phthisis bulbi:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Atrophia bulbi without shrinkage.</span> In this initial stage, the size and shape of the <br />eye are maintained despite the atrophy of intraocular tissues. The following structures are most sensitive to loss of nutrition: the lens, which becomes cataractous; the retina, which atrophies and becomes separated from the RPE by serous fluid accumulation; and the aqueous outflow tract, where anterior and posterior synechiae develop.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Atrophia bulbi with shrinkage.</span> In this stage, the eye becomes soft because of ciliary body dysfunction and the progressive diminution of IOP. The globe becomes smaller and assumes a squared-off configuration as a result of the influence of the 4&#160;rectus muscles. The anterior chamber collapses. Associated corneal endothelial cell damage initially results in corneal edema, followed by opacification from degenerative pannus, stromal scarring, and vascularization. Most of the remaining internal structures of the eye will be atrophic but recognizable histologically.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">Phthisis bulbi</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-13</span>). In this end stage, the size of the globe shrinks from a normal average diameter of 24–26&#160;mm to an average diameter of 16–19&#160;mm. Most of the ocular contents become disorganized. In areas of preserved uvea, the RPE proliferates, and drusen may develop. In addition, extensive dystrophic calcification of Bowman layer, lens, retina, and drusen usually occurs. Osseous metaplasia of the RPE with bone formation may be a prominent feature. Finally, the sclera becomes markedly thickened, particularly posteriorly.</li>
