			<p class="chapter-title">Melanocytic Tumors</p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Introduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt17_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intraocular melanocytic tumors develop from uveal melanocytes in the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. In contrast to melanocytic tumors of the skin and mucosal membranes, which usually initially spread through the lymphatics, uveal melanocytic tumors typically disseminate hematogenously, if there is metastatic spread.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The 2&#160;main groups of melanocytic tumors of the uvea are (1)&#160;the benign nevi and (2)&#160;the melanomas. Pigmented intraocular tumors that originate in the pigmented epithelium of the iris, ciliary body, and retina constitute another group of melanin-&#173;containing tumors of neuroepithelial origin. These rare tumors are discussed separately at the end of this chapter. See also Chapter&#160;12.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Iris Nevus</p>
			<div id="Chapt17_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An iris nevus typically appears as a variably pigmented lesion of the iris stroma that causes minimal distortion of the iris architecture. The true prevalence of iris nevi remains uncertain; many of these lesions are small, produce no symptoms, and are recognized incidentally during routine ophthalmic examination. Iris nevi present in 2&#160;forms:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="italic">circumscribed iris nevi,</span> which are flat to nodular, solitary or multiple, involving a discrete portion of the iris (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-1A–D</span>)</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">&#9;2.&#9;<span class="italic">diffuse iris nevi,</span> which may involve an entire sector or, in rare instances, the entire iris (Fig&#160;17-1E)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lesions may cause ectropion uveae (Fig&#160;17-1D, F) and, sometimes, a sectoral cataract. The incidence of iris nevi may be higher in eyes of patients with neurofibromatosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Iris nevi are best evaluated by slit-lamp biomicroscopy coupled with gonioscopic evaluation of the anterior chamber angle structures. The clinician should pay specific attention to lesions involving the angle in order to rule out a ciliary body tumor; the most important differential diagnosis is iris or ciliary body melanoma. When melanoma cannot be excluded, close observation with serial slit-lamp photography and, ideally, high-&#173;frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy is indicated. Iris nevi do not usually require treatment.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Nevus of the Ciliary Body and Choroid</p>
			<div id="Chapt17_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nevi of the ciliary body are mostly small and incidental findings in histologic examination of globes enucleated for other reasons.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Choroidal nevi may occur in up to 8% of the population. Like iris nevi, in most cases, they cause no symptoms and are recognized on routine ophthalmic examination. The typical choroidal nevus appears ophthalmoscopically as a flat or minimally elevated, pigmented (gray to brown) choroidal lesion with soft margins (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-2A–D</span>). Some nevi are amelanotic and less apparent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Choroidal nevi are often associated with overlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) disturbance and drusen (see Fig&#160;17-2B,&#160;C). A minority develop a localized serous retinal detachment over and around the nevus, orange pigment, or choroidal neovascular membranes (see Fig&#160;17-2C,&#160;D). These nevi may result in reduced vision, metamorphopsia, and visual field defects. Congenital ocular melanocytosis in the choroid is similar in appearance to a diffuse nevus (Fig&#160;17-2E).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Findings from fluorescein angiography are not diagnostic; choroidal nevi may either hypofluoresce or hyperfluoresce, depending on the associated findings. Nevi are distinguished from choroidal melanomas and other pigmented fundus lesions by clinical evaluation and ancillary testing, as described in the section Melanoma of the Ciliary Body and Choroid.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The recommended management of a choroidal nevus is photographic documentation of all lesions, optical coherence tomographic (OCT) measurement of lesions thinner than 1&#160;mm, ultrasonographic measurement of lesions thicker than 1&#160;mm, and regular, lifelong, periodic reassessment for signs of growth. Benign nevi can increase in diameter. According to a long-term follow-&#173;up study, nevi enlarged a median of 1&#160;mm overall, but the median yearly rate of enlargement was less than 0.1&#160;mm, and none of the enlarging nevi developed new orange pigment or subretinal fluid. Frequency of enlargement was 54% in patients younger than 40&#160;years and 19% in patients older than 60&#160;years. If faster or more extensive enlargement is documented, especially in patients older than 40&#160;years, malignant change should be ruled out.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Melanocytoma of the Iris, Ciliary Body, and Choroid</p>
			<div id="Chapt17_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Melanocytomas (magnocellular nevi) are rare tumors composed of characteristic large, polyhedron-&#173;shaped nevus cells that have small nuclei and abundant cytoplasm filled with large melanin granules (see Chapter&#160;15, Fig&#160;15-12). Iris melanocytoma cells may seed to the anterior chamber angle, causing glaucoma. Melanocytomas of the ciliary body are usually not seen clinically because of their peripheral location. In some cases, extrascleral extension of tumor along an emissary canal appears as a darkly pigmented, fixed subconjunctival mass. Melanocytomas of the choroid and optic nerve head appear as elevated, pigmented tumors, simulating a nevus or a melanoma (Fig&#160;17-2F). There have been reported cases of malignant change in some melanocytomas. When a melanocytoma is suspected, photographic and ultrasonographic studies are appropriate. If growth is documented, melanoma should be excluded.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Iris Melanoma</p>
			<div id="Chapt17_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Iris melanomas account for 3%–5% of all uveal melanomas. Small melanomas of the iris may be impossible to clinically differentiate from benign iris nevi.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Iris melanomas range in appearance from amelanotic to dark brown lesions, and three-&#173;quarters of them involve the inferior iris (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-3A–C</span>). In rare cases, their growth pattern is diffuse, resulting in unilateral acquired hyperchromic heterochromia and secondary glaucoma. One subtype grows in a pattern that resembles tapioca pudding (Fig&#160;17-3D).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinical evaluation of iris melanoma is identical to that for iris nevi. Signs suggesting malignancy include large size, prominent ectropion uveae and vascularity, sectoral cataract, secondary glaucoma, seeding of the peripheral angle structures, extrascleral extension, and documented progressive growth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of iris melanoma may include the following conditions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5">iris freckle (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-4A</span>)</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Advances in high-&#173;frequency ultrasonography enable excellent characterization of tumor size and anatomical relationship to normal ocular structures (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-5A, B</span>). Anterior segment OCT may be helpful, but currently available instrumentation often does not penetrate the full thickness of the lesion (Fig&#160;17-5C). Fluorescein angiography may document intrinsic vascularity; however, this finding is of limited value in differential diagnosis. Biopsy may be considered when the diagnosis is not clear. If there is documented growth, or if secondary glaucoma occurs, diagnostic and therapeutic excision is indicated. Alternatively, brachytherapy using custom-&#173;designed plaques or proton-&#173;beam radiotherapy may be used.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The prognosis for most patients with iris melanoma is excellent; the mortality rate is low (1%–4%), possibly because the tumor is usually smaller and its biological behavior may be distinct from that of choroidal and ciliary body melanomas. The main risk factor for metastatic death is anterior chamber angle invasion, which may present as poorly controlled glaucoma, mimicking pigmentary glaucoma.</p>

			<p class="h1">Melanoma of the Ciliary Body and Choroid</p>
			<div id="Chapt17_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ciliary body and choroidal melanomas (posterior melanomas) are the most common primary intraocular malignancies in adults. Approximately 6700–7100&#160;uveal melanomas are diagnosed annually, of which 65% affect non-&#173;Hispanic whites; 87,000–106,000&#160;survivors are under follow-&#173;up care. The incidence varies by age, ethnicity, and latitude, ranging from 0.2&#160;cases per million in people of Asian descent to 8.6 per million in whites living in regions at higher latitudes. The incidence in the United States increases from 4.6 to <br />7.5 per million and the incidence in Europe increases from 2.6 to 8.4 per million from south to north, respectively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Less than 1% of ciliary body and choroidal melanomas are diagnosed in children younger than 18&#160;years. Approximately 80% of these melanomas are found in adults between 45 and 80&#160;years of age. In the United States and Europe, the mean age at diagnosis is 60–65&#160;years, whereas in Asia it is 45–50&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Risk factors in addition to race and ethnicity, age, and latitude have not been conclusively identified, but they may include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">light-&#173;colored complexion (white skin, blue eyes, blond hair) and an inability to tan (associated with white race)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ocular melanocytic abnormalities including nevi (lifetime risk = 1:500) and congenital ocular and oculodermal melanocytosis (lifetime risk = 1:400)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">dysplastic nevus syndrome (threefold risk)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">BAP1</span> germline mutation or other genetic predisposition</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ultraviolet radiation is not a risk factor for posterior melanoma; it might even be protective because it increases production of vitamin&#160;D, which is thought to lower the risk of cancers in tissues not exposed to direct sunlight.</p>
			<p class="h2">Clinical Characteristics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Because of their location behind the iris, <span class="italic">ciliary body melanomas</span> often remain asymptomatic until they become rather large (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-6A</span>). Symptoms and signs eventually include episcleral sentinel vessels (Fig&#160;17-6B); reduced vision from induced astigmatism or cataract when the tumor touches the lens (see Fig&#160;17-6A); photopsia and visual field alterations from the associated, usually late retinal detachment; and, rarely, secondary glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ciliary body melanomas are not usually visible unless the pupil is widely dilated. Some erode through the iris root into the anterior chamber and become visible during gonioscopic (Fig&#160;17-6C) or external examination (Fig&#160;17-6D). Eventually, the tumor extends through the sclera along aqueous channels, producing an epibulbar nodule (Fig&#160;17-6E). Some ciliary body melanomas assume a diffuse growth pattern and extend up to 360° around the eye; in this case, they are known as <span class="italic">ring melanomas</span> (Fig&#160;17-6F).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The typical <span class="italic">choroidal melanoma</span> is a variably pigmented, elevated, initially flat or dome-shaped subretinal mass (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-7A–C</span>). Initial symptoms and signs may deceptively resemble those of vitreous detachment, but eventually metamorphopsia, reduced vision, and a visual field defect from direct tumor growth or secondary retinal detachment develop. The degree of pigmentation ranges from amelanotic to dark brown (Fig&#160;17-7C,&#160;D). At the RPE level, clumps of orange pigment may appear over the surface of smaller tumors (see Fig&#160;17-7A) and serous detachment of the neurosensory retina is common (see Fig&#160;17-7C,&#160;D). With time, 50% of tumors erupt through Bruch membrane and assume a mushroom shape; some also erode through the retina, causing subretinal or vitreous hemorrhage (Fig&#160;17-7E,&#160;F). If an extensive retinal detachment develops, anterior displacement of the lens–iris diaphragm and secondary angle-&#173;closure glaucoma occasionally occur. In advanced cases, neovascularization of the iris may occur.</p>
			<p class="h2">Diagnostic Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinical evaluation of suspected posterior uveal melanomas includes obtaining a history (including family history of cancer), performing an ophthalmoscopic evaluation, and ancillary testing. When used appropriately, the tests described in this chapter enable accurate diagnosis of melanocytic tumors in almost all cases. Atypical lesions may need to be characterized via other testing modalities, including fine-&#173;needle aspiration or vitrectomy biopsy; alternatively, when appropriate, lesions may be closely observed for characteristic changes in clinical behavior in order to establish a correct diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most important diagnostic technique for evaluating patients with intraocular tumors is <span class="italic">indirect ophthalmoscopic viewing;</span> it provides stereopsis and a wide field of view and facilitates visualization of the peripheral fundus, particularly when performed with scleral depression. Indirect ophthalmoscopy and wide-&#173;field fundus photography enable clinical assessment of tumor basal dimension and apical height. However, eyes with opaque media require ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Slit-lamp biomicroscopy,</span> used in combination with <span class="italic">gonioscopy,</span> offers the best clinical method for establishing the presence and extent of anterior involvement of the tumor (see Fig&#160;17-6C). High-&#173;frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy also enables excellent visualization of anterior ocular structures. To evaluate lesions of the posterior fundus under high magnification, Goldmann 3-mirror and newer wide-field contact lenses can be used with the slit lamp, enabling a detailed assessment of neurosensory retinal detachment, orange pigment, rupture of Bruch membrane, retinal tumor invasion, and vitreous involvement.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Fundus photography</span> is valuable for documenting the appearance of choroidal melanoma and for identifying changes in its shape and basal dimensions in follow-&#173;up examinations. Wide-&#173;angle (60°–200°) fundus photographs (see Fig&#160;17-6C–F) can reveal the full extent of many tumors and document their relationship to intraocular landmarks. The relative positions of retinal blood vessels may be helpful markers of changes in the size of a lesion. Wide-&#173;angle fundus photographs allow clinicians to use intrinsic scales to measure the basal diameter of a choroidal melanoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Fundus autofluorescence (FAF)</span> imaging helps highlight orange pigment, which is brightly autofluorescent (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-8A,&#160;B</span>). FAF is especially helpful in confirming the presence of orange pigment over amelanotic melanomas. In addition, any recent leakage of subretinal fluid produces increased autofluorescence (see Fig 17-8B), whereas long-&#173;standing or past leakage may result in decreased autofluorescence from secondary RPE atrophy.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">OCT</span> is generally more accurate than ultrasonography when used for measuring and following changes in the thickness of choroidal lesions thinner than 1&#160;mm, especially in the enhanced depth imaging (EDI) mode. OCT is also helpful in differential diagnosis because it can reveal degenerative RPE and photoreceptor changes in long-&#173;standing lesions, as well as orange pigment and subretinal fluid in suspicious pigmented lesions.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Fluorescein angiography</span> findings are not pathognomonic for choroidal melanoma. <span class="italic">Indocyanine green angiography</span> is not more accurate for diagnosis, but it does often show alterations in choroidal blood flow in the region of the tumor. Wide-field angiography can also be used to assess vascular compromise after radiotherapy of choroidal melanomas.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Ultrasonography</span> is the most important ancillary tool for evaluating ciliary body and choroidal melanomas. The growth and regression of an intraocular tumor can be documented with serial examination. Standardized A-scan ultrasonography usually reveals a solid tumor pattern with high-&#173;amplitude initial echoes and low-&#173;amplitude internal reflections (low internal reflectivity; Fig&#160;17-8C). Spontaneous vascular pulsations can be demonstrated in most cases. B-scan examination provides information about the size (thickness and basal diameter), general shape, and position of intraocular tumors (Fig&#160;17-8D,&#160;E). B-scan ultrasonography is the best technique for detection of posterior extrascleral extension associated with intraocular malignancies (Fig&#160;17-8F). Occasionally, tumor shape and associated retinal detachment can be evaluated more easily with ultrasonography than with ophthalmoscopy. B-scan ultrasonography typically shows a dome-shaped (see Fig 17-8D) or collar button–shaped (see Fig 17-8E) choroidal mass that has a highly reflective anterior border, acoustic hollowness, and choroidal excavation. The peripheral location of ciliary body melanomas makes standard ultrasonography more difficult to perform. High-&#173;frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy, which does not share these limitations, enables excellent imaging of the anterior segment and ciliary body (see Fig&#160;17-5). Although ultrasonography is generally considered highly reliable in the differential diagnosis of posterior uveal melanoma, it may be difficult or impossible to differentiate a necrotic melanoma from a subretinal hemorrhage or a melanoma from an atypical metastatic tumor.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although <span class="italic">CT</span> and <span class="italic">MRI</span> are not widely used to assess uncomplicated intraocular melanocytic tumors, they are useful in identifying tumors in eyes with opaque media and in determining extrascleral extension and involvement of other organs. MRI may help differentiate intraocular hemorrhage and atypical vascular lesions from melanocytic tumors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If high-frequency ultrasonography is not available, <span class="italic">transillumination</span> may be helpful in assessing the degree of pigmentation and in determining basal diameters of suspected ciliary body or anterior choroidal melanomas. The shadow of a tumor is visible with a transilluminating light source, preferably a high-&#173;intensity fiber-&#173;optic device, placed either on the surface of the topically anesthetized eye in a quadrant opposite the lesion or directly on the cornea, using a dark corneal cap (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-9</span>). Fiber-&#173;optic transillumination is also routinely used during surgery for radioactive applicator insertion to locate the uveal melanoma and delineate its borders.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Differential Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This section describes the most common lesions to be considered in the differential diagnosis of posterior uveal melanoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnostic accuracy for <span class="italic">choroidal nevus,</span> discussed earlier in this chapter, is associated with clinical experience and availability of ancillary testing facilities. For the evaluation and management of posterior pigmented lesions with characteristics predictive of growth, patients may be referred to ocular oncology centers. No single clinical factor is pathognomonic for benign versus malignant choroidal melanocytic lesions. Specifically, 6%–10% of benign choroidal nevi show orange pigment and 9%–15% are associated with subretinal fluid. Only 11%–58% of these nevi, increasing in frequency with the age of the patient, have overlying drusen. More than 20% of choroidal melanocytic tumors thicker than 3&#160;mm are melanomas, and far less than 1% of those thinner than 1&#160;mm are melanomas. Tumors that are 1–3&#160;mm in thickness are difficult to classify with certainty. The risk of malignancy increases substantially for lesions larger than 6&#160;mm in basal diameter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinical risk factors for the growth of small choroidal melanocytic lesions have been well characterized; they include 5&#160;clinical features that have given rise to the mnemonic “<span class="italic">t</span>o <span class="italic">f</span>ind <span class="italic">s</span>mall <span class="italic">o</span>cular <span class="italic">m</span>elanomas”:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5"><span class="italic">t</span>hickness of the tumor greater than 2&#160;mm</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">f</span>luid under the retina</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">s</span>ymptoms (eg, metamorphopsia, photopsia, visual field loss)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">o</span>range pigmentation overlying the tumor</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-9"><span class="italic">m</span>argin of the tumor touching the optic nerve head</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following risk factors are also important:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5">larger size at presentation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">absence of drusen or degenerative RPE changes</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">homogeneous low internal reflectivity on ultrasonography</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-9">hot spots on fluorescein angiography</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">To document growth, the clinician may periodically photograph and measure the tumor with OCT (using the EDI mode) or ultrasonography. Slow growth does not necessarily suggest or confirm malignancy. Of 284&#160;benign choroidal nevi, 31% showed enlargement (median increase in diameter = 1&#160;mm) over long observation periods (7&#160;years or more). The frequency of enlargement may be higher in patients younger than 40&#160;years (54%) compared with those older than 60&#160;years (19%). Enlarging nevi may not develop any new orange pigment or subretinal fluid suggestive of malignant change. Thus, if rapid or progressive growth occurs, or new risk factors appear, definitive treatment should be considered. When risk factors for growth are identified, transscleral or transvitreal fine-&#173;needle aspiration or vitrectomy biopsy is an alternative to follow-&#173;up. Monosomy&#160;3 or a gene expression profile other than class&#160;1A is generally interpreted as a melanoma with significant metastatic potential.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Melanocytoma</span> (magnocellular nevus) of the ciliary body or optic nerve head typically appears as a dark brown to black lesion. It is usually located eccentrically over the optic nerve head, and it may be elevated. It often has fibrillar or feathery margins as a result of extension into the nerve fiber layer (see Fig&#160;17-2F; see also Chapter&#160;15, Fig&#160;15-12). Because a melanocytoma rarely transforms into melanoma, it is important to differentiate the two. Melanocytomas can produce an afferent pupillary defect and visual field abnormalities ranging from an enlarged blind spot to extensive nerve fiber layer defects.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Congenital hypertrophy of the RPE (CHRPE)</span> refers to a sharply defined, flat, very darkly pigmented lesion that ranges from 1&#160;mm to greater than 10&#160;mm in diameter. Patients are asymptomatic, and the lesion can be noted during ophthalmic examination at any age. In younger patients, CHRPE often appears homogeneously black; in older individuals, foci of depigmentation (lacunae) often develop (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-10B,&#160;C</span>), and the lesion may slowly enlarge (Fig&#160;17-10C; see also Fig&#160;17-10B). The histologic findings are identical to that of <span class="italic">grouped pigmentation of the retina,</span> also known as <span class="italic">bear tracks</span> (Fig&#160;17-10D). The presence of multiple, atypical CHRPE-like patches in patients with <span class="italic">Gardner syndrome,</span> a subtype of <span class="italic">familial adenomatous polyposis,</span> appears to be a marker for the development of colon carcinoma. Fundus findings enable the ophthalmologist to help the gastroenterologist determine which family members should participate in colon carcinoma screening (see Chapter&#160;11).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with <span class="italic">age-related macular degeneration (AMD)</span> may present with macular or extramacular subretinal neovascularization, hemorrhage, and fibrosis, accompanied by varying degrees and patterns of pigmentation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-11A</span>). Hemorrhage, a finding commonly associated with exudative AMD, usually does not occur with melanomas unless they have broken through Bruch membrane. Clinical evaluation of the fellow eye is helpful in documenting AMD. OCT shows predominantly subretinal and intraretinal abnormalities. Ultrasonography reveals high or heterogeneous reflectivity rather than low internal reflectivity, as well as a lack of intrinsic vascularity. When in doubt, the clinician may use fluorescein angiography to help reveal early hypofluorescence secondary to blockage from the hemorrhage, which is often followed by late hyperfluorescence in the distribution of the choroidal neovascular membrane (Fig&#160;17-11B). Serial observation shows involutional alterations of the evolving disciform lesion.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Choroidal detachments</span> can be hemorrhagic or serous. They are often associated with hypotony and may develop in the early postoperative period after ophthalmic surgery. Hemorrhagic detachments are often dome shaped, involve multiple quadrants, and may be associated with breakthrough vitreous bleeding. Ultrasonographic findings may closely resemble those of melanoma but reveal absence of intrinsic vascularity and involution of the hemorrhage over time. Observational management is indicated in most cases. MRI with gadolinium enhancement may be beneficial in suspicious cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy (PEHCR)</span> is a spontaneously developing, often asymptomatic peripheral lesion in elderly individuals that resembles a choroidal detachment. It is often associated with suprachoroidal or subretinal bleeding and lipid exudation; associated retinal detachment is uncommon (Fig&#160;17-11C). PEHCR is thought to be analogous to AMD, and the fellow eye often shows a similar or a nonexudative chorioretinal degeneration. PEHCR almost always involutes spontaneously.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Choroidal osteomas</span> are benign, presumably acquired bony tumors that typically arise from the juxtapapillary choroid in young adults (more commonly in women) and are bilateral in 20%–25% of cases. The characteristic lesion appears yellow to orange and has well-&#173;defined margins (Fig&#160;17-11D). Ultrasonography reveals a high-&#173;amplitude echo corresponding to the bony plate and loss of the normal orbital echoes behind the lesion (acoustic shadowing). CT can reveal calcification but is not needed for diagnosis. Choroidal osteomas typically enlarge slowly over many years and can decalcify with time. If they involve the macula, vision is generally impaired. Subretinal neovascularization is a common complication. The etiology of these lesions is unknown, but chronic low-grade choroidal inflammation has been suspected (see Chapter&#160;12).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Choroidal hemangiomas</span> (see Chapter&#160;18) resemble the surrounding fundus in color and may appear to be lightly pigmented. Over time, a serous retinal detachment may develop. These lesions, which are often associated with overlying cystic retinal degeneration, are hyperechogenic on ultrasonography and show a characteristic vascular pattern on fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Varix of the vortex vein</span> (Fig&#160;17-11E) is found predominantly in the nasal quadrants and can reach 4–5&#160;mm in diameter. When filled with blood, it appears dark in color. The clinician can easily diagnose this condition by observing its coincidence with the vortex vein ampulla and by gently compressing the eye during indirect ophthalmoscopy, which causes the varix to deflate.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Intraocular metastases</span> (Fig&#160;17-11F; see also Chapter&#160;20) are generally amelanotic and thus pale or yellowish, unless they originate from cutaneous melanoma. Most show moderately high or heterogeneous reflectivity on ultrasonography.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">Table&#160;17-1</span> lists additional conditions to be considered in cases with <span class="italic">amelanotic</span> choroidal masses.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Classification</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Melanomas of the ciliary body and choroid have been categorized by size in several different ways. Although a size classification based on tumor volume would be logical, no simple and reliable method for assessing tumor volume is available. The <span class="italic">Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS)</span> classified posterior uveal melanomas as small, medium, or large on the basis of thickness and basal diameter. </p>
			<p class="body-text">The recently revised, evidence-&#173;based, and validated Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is recommended. The seventh and forthcoming eighth editions both categorize posterior melanomas as small&#160;(T1), medium&#160;(T2), large&#160;(T3), or very large&#160;(T4) according to tumor thickness and basal diameter, extension to the ciliary body, and extrascleral growth. These categories are used to assign melanomas into 7&#160;stages (I, IIA, IIB, IIIA–C, and&#160;IV) that differ in prognosis (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;17-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Metastatic Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The incidence of metastatic uveal melanoma is as high as 50% at 25&#160;years after treatment for ciliary body or choroidal melanoma. The COMS&#160;reported an incidence of metastatic disease of 25% at 5&#160;years after initial treatment and 34% at 10&#160;years. However, metastatic disease at the time of initial presentation can be detected in less than 2% of patients. It is likely that many patients have undetectable micrometastases at the time <br />of their primary treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The liver is the primary organ involved in metastatic uveal melanoma; in 90% of patients, liver involvement is the first manifestation of metastatic disease. Other relatively frequent sites, generally after liver metastasis, include the lungs, bones, and skin. In cases that were autopsied, liver involvement was found in 100% and lung involvement in 50% of patients with metastases. All patients require metastatic evaluation prior to definitive treatment of intraocular melanoma (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;17-3</span>). The purpose of this evaluation is twofold:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-12">&#9;1.&#9;To determine whether the patient has any other medical conditions that contraindicate surgical treatment or need to be treated. The COMS and smaller studies have found a second primary cancer in approximately 10% of patients. If there is any question regarding whether the lesion in the eye is a metastatic tumor, the clinician should conduct a thorough medical evaluation to determine the site of primary malignancy.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-13">&#9;2.&#9;To rule out the possibility of detectable metastatic melanoma from the eye, especially for AJCC T3 melanomas (metastasis found in 3%) and T4 melanomas (metastasis found in 20%). If metastatic disease is clinically present during the pretreatment evaluation, enucleation is inappropriate unless the eye is painful.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In order to detect metastatic disease at an early phase, metastatic evaluation is often performed on all patients with uveal melanoma on a yearly basis. Some centers initially provide surveillance every 3 to 6&#160;months if the risk of metastasis is considered to be high (eg, AJCC stage&#160;III; presence of epithelioid cells, monosomy&#160;3, or class&#160;2 gene expression profile). Metastatic evaluation should include a comprehensive physical examination; however, liver imaging is the most important component of the evaluation. Ultrasonography of the abdomen is usually sufficient, but if metastatic disease is suspected, triphasic CT, MRI, or positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) is usually recommended in order to evaluate the extent of the disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Liver function tests are usually performed; however, they have recently become less reliable in the evaluation of liver metastases because of increasingly common fatty liver disease and the widespread use of cholesterol-&#173;lowering statins, which may alter liver enzyme levels. Chest x-ray is also usually performed at the time of diagnosis, although its yield is low. Possible novel blood markers for early detection of metastatic uveal melanoma are being explored.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A liver or other organ-site biopsy may confirm metastatic disease. Biopsy is appropriate before the institution of any treatment for metastatic disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The interval between the diagnosis of primary uveal melanoma and its metastasis depends on many clinical, histologic, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic factors. It varies from a few months to more than 25&#160;years. When metastatic disease is diagnosed early enough, the options for treatment include surgical resection; chemotherapy, including intra-&#173;arterial hepatic chemotherapy and chemoembolization; immunotherapy or biological therapy; and hepatic selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT, also known as intrahepatic radioembolization).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For many years, management of posterior uveal melanomas was controversial for 2&#160;reasons: (1)&#160;data on the natural history of untreated patients with posterior uveal melanoma were limited, and (2)&#160;there were insufficient data on patients who were matched for known and unknown risk factors and managed by different therapeutic techniques to assess the comparative effectiveness of those treatments. Currently, both surgical and radiotherapeutic techniques are used to treat posterior uveal melanoma. The COMS&#160;reported outcomes of randomized, prospectively administered treatment of patients with medium and large choroidal melanomas. The choice of treatment depends on 4&#160;factors:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-12">&#9;1.&#9;size, location, and extent of the tumor</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;2.&#9;vision status of the affected eye and of the fellow eye</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;3.&#9;age and general health of the patient</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-4">&#9;4.&#9;patient and physician preference</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Observation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most benign choroidal tumors (eg, nevus, osteoma, and hemangioma) can be managed with observation. Significant controversy persists regarding the diagnosis and management of small choroidal melanomas. Lesions with any of the 5&#160;main risk factors for growth (thickness &gt;2&#160;mm, subretinal fluid, symptoms, orange pigment, or tumor margin touching the optic nerve head), and all lesions with documented growth, should be considered for treatment. Short-term observation to verify growth of a suspected small uveal melanoma has traditionally been considered appropriate, especially when the tumor is located in the macular area. As mentioned earlier, a fine-&#173;needle aspiration or vitrectomy biopsy can be considered as an alternative. Observation of active and larger melanomas may be appropriate in very elderly patients and those with systemic illness who are poor candidates for any kind of therapeutic intervention.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Enucleation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Historically, enucleation has been the gold standard in the treatment for malignant intraocular tumors. A past hypothesis that surgical manipulation of eyes containing a melanoma would lead to tumor dissemination and increased mortality is no longer accepted. Enucleation remains appropriate for some small to medium (T1 and T2), many large&#160;(T3), and most very large&#160;(T4) choroidal melanomas, especially when useful vision has been lost or when the patient declines other treatments. The COMS found no evidence that pre-&#173;enucleation external-&#173;beam radiotherapy performed on patients with large choroidal melanomas improves 5-year mortality rates. However, local orbital recurrence was more frequent after enucleation alone.</p>

			<p class="h3">Brachytherapy with a radioactive plaque</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The application of a radioactive plaque to the sclera overlying an intraocular tumor is probably the most common way to treat uveal melanoma. With this technique, which has been widely available since the 1950s, a very high dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumor (typically 80–100&#160;gray [Gy] to the tumor apex and up to 1000&#160;Gy to the tumor base), while a relatively low dose is delivered to the surrounding normal structures of the eye. Although various isotopes can be used (eg, cobalt-60, strontium-90, iridium-192, and palladium-103), the most common are iodine-125 (γ-rays) and ruthenium-106 (β-rays). In the United States, iodine-125 is the most frequently used isotope in the treatment of uveal melanomas of any size; whereas in Europe, ruthenium-106 is preferred for smaller melanomas. Advances in intraoperative localization, especially the use of ultrasonography, have increased local tumor control rates, which typically reach 90%. In most patients, the tumor decreases in size (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;17-12A</span>); in others, the result could be total flattening of the tumor or little change in size, although clinical and ultrasound changes may be evident. Regrowth is diagnosed in approximately 10% of treated tumors, usually at 1&#160;tumor margin, but sometimes diffusely.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Radiation-&#173;related adverse effects, especially optic neuropathy and maculopathy, limit vision in as many as 50% of patients, depending on tumor size and location. These adverse effects may or may not respond to intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-&#173;VEGF) treatment. When the tumor is anteriorly located, radiation cataract is common and can be managed with routine cataract extraction. After initial radiotherapy, large tumors may cause a chronic exudative retinal detachment or become “toxic,” often leading to neovascular glaucoma, which may respond to intravitreal anti-&#173;VEGF, intraocular pressure–lowering medication, cyclophotocoagulation, or resection of the residual tumor. Radiation complications appear to be dose-&#173;dependent and typically develop after a delay of 1 to several years.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">Charged-particle radiation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">High–linear energy transfer radiation with charged particles (protons or helium ions) is effective in managing ciliary body and choroidal melanomas. In this technique, tantalum clips are surgically attached to the sclera to mark the basal margins of the tumor prior to the first radiation fraction. The charged-&#173;particle beams deliver a more homogeneous dose of radiation energy to a tumor than a radioactive plaque would, and the lateral spread of radiation energy is less extensive; the energy loss of ionizing radiation during its travel through matter is known as the <span class="italic">Bragg peak effect.</span> Local tumor control rates of up to 98% have been reported. The tumor response is similar to that observed after brachytherapy. Radiation complications, usually anterior, lead to neovascular glaucoma in 10% and some vision loss in up to 50% of treated eyes, depending on tumor size and location. Chronic dry eye may develop.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">External-beam radiotherapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conventional external-&#173;beam radiotherapy is ineffective for uveal melanoma. In recent years, some centers have used fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and gamma knife radiosurgery as the primary treatment. The results and adverse effects are comparable to those of other irradiation methods.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">Alternative treatments</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Transpupillary thermotherapy and photodynamic therapy</span> In the past, laser photocoagulation played a limited role in the treatment of melanocytic tumors. Today, transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT), in which a long-&#173;duration, large–spot size, relatively low-&#173;energy infrared diode laser raises the temperature of the choroid, is used to manage selected small choroidal melanomas and, more frequently, to augment plaque brachytherapy or to control a local recurrence at the tumor margin. Reports suggest that TTT alone is associated with a higher rate of local tumor recurrence compared with brachytherapy. Some of these recurrences are extraocular.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h4-head">Surgical excision</span> Surgical transscleral resection or endoresection during vitrectomy has been successfully performed in eyes with malignant and benign intraocular tumors (Fig&#160;17-12B). Concerns regarding surgical excision include the inability to evaluate tumor margins for residual disease, the high incidence of pathologically recognized scleral and retinal involvement in medium and large choroidal melanomas, and the possibility of spreading the tumor intraocularly and extraocularly. The surgical techniques are generally quite demanding, requiring an experienced surgeon with specialized training. Today, local excision of uveal melanoma is coupled with adjuvant radiotherapy, such as brachytherapy or proton-&#173;beam therapy, to reduce local recurrence rates to levels comparable to those after radiotherapy.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-17"><span class="h4-head">Chemotherapy</span> Currently, chemotherapy is not effective in the treatment of primary uveal melanoma. However, various regimens are available to treat patients with metastatic disease.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-17"><span class="h4-head">Immunotherapy</span> In immunotherapy, systemic cytokines, immunomodulatory agents, or vaccine therapy is used to try to activate a tumor-&#173;directed T-cell immune response. This treatment is theoretically appropriate for uveal melanoma, because primary tumors arise in an immune-&#173;privileged organ and may express antigens to which the host is not sensitized. Currently, however, immunotherapy for primary uveal melanoma is not available. Immunotherapy for metastatic disease is under investigation.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-17"><span class="h4-head">Exenteration</span> Traditionally advocated for patients with extrascleral extension of a posterior uveal melanoma, exenteration is rarely employed today. The current trend is toward more conservative treatment for these patients, with either enucleation plus a limited tenonectomy, or modified plaque brachytherapy or proton-&#173;beam therapy, unless orbital invasion is very advanced.</p>

Benign adenomas of the RPE are rare. These lesions are oval, deeply melanotic tumors that arise abruptly from the RPE. Adenomas rarely enlarge and seldom undergo malignant change. Adenocarcinomas of the RPE are also very rare; only a few cases have been reported. They typically have feeder retinal vessels and may be associated with yellowish lipid exudates. Although these lesions display malignant features on histologic examination, their metastatic potential is minimal.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Simple hamartoma of the RPE is a small (up to 1&#160;mm), sharply demarcated transretinal lesion that is located close to the center of the macula, arising from the RPE (Fig&#160;17-13B). These lesions do not change over time.</p>
			<p class="h2">Combined Hamartoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Combined hamartoma of the RPE and retina is a rare disorder that occurs most frequently near the optic nerve head margin, though it may also be observed in the peripheral fundus. Typically, the hamartoma appears as a pigmented, slightly elevated lesion with vitreoretinal traction and tortuous retinal vessels (Fig&#160;17-13C, see also Fig 11-49). Glial cells within this lesion may contract, producing traction lines seen clinically in the retina. Exudative complications associated with the vascular component of the lesion may be seen. These lesions have been mistaken for melanomas because of their pigmentation, slight elevation, and propensity to change in young individuals.</p>
