				<div id="Chapt5_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The conjunctiva is a mucous membrane that lines the posterior surface of the eyelids and the anterior surface of the globe as far as the limbus. It can be divided into 3&#160;regions: <span class="italic">pal</span><span class="italic">pebral, forniceal,</span> and <span class="italic">bulbar.</span> The conjunctiva consists of nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium with goblet cells and a delicate basement membrane, which rests on the underlying stroma <span class="italic">(substantia propria)</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-1A–D</span>). Elements of the stroma include loosely arranged collagen fibers; blood vessels and lymphatic channels; nerves; occasional accessory lacrimal glands; and resident lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and mast cells. In places, the lymphocytes are organized into lymphoid follicles, referred to as <span class="italic">conjunctiva-&#173;associated lymphoid tissue (CALT),</span> which is a subtype of <span class="italic">mucosa-&#173;associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)</span> (see the section Lymphoid Lesions in this chapter). The stroma of the caruncle is the only part of the conjunctiva that, like skin, also contains sebaceous glands and hair follicles (Fig&#160;5-1E). See BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> and Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for further discussion of the conjunctiva.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Congenital Anomalies</p>
				<div id="Chapt5_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Choristomas</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Choristomatous lesions of the ocular surface range from limbal dermoid to complex choristoma. A <span class="italic">choristoma</span> is a benign, congenital proliferation of histologically mature tissue that is abnormal for a given topographic location.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Dermoids</span> are firm, dome-shaped, white-&#173;yellow nodules typically found at or straddling the limbus, most commonly in the inferotemporal quadrant (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-2A,&#160;B</span>). Dermoids may occur in isolation or, particularly when bilateral, as a manifestation of a congenital complex such as Goldenhar syndrome (oculoauriculovertebral dysgenesis, characterized by epibulbar dermoid, upper eyelid coloboma, preauricular skin tags, and vertebral anomalies) or linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (an oculoneurocutaneous disorder). Dermoids often contain dermal adnexal structures. The surface epithelium may or may not be keratinized (Fig&#160;5-2C).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In contrast with dermoids, <span class="italic">lipodermoids</span> (or <span class="italic">dermolipomas</span>) occur more commonly in the superotemporal quadrant, toward the fornix; they may extend posteriorly into the orbit. Lipodermoids are composed of a significant amount of mature adipose tissue, which makes them softer and yellower than dermoids. Dermal adnexal structures may or may not be present (Fig&#160;5-2D). Lipodermoids, like dermoids, may be associated with Goldenhar syndrome or linear nevus sebaceous syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Osseous choristomas</span> contain bone. <span class="italic">Complex choristomas</span> possess features of multiple types of choristomas, for example, dermoid or lipodermoid and osseous choristoma (Fig&#160;5-2E). Clinically, complex choristomas are often indistinguishable from dermoids or lipodermoids. They may be associated with linear nevus sebaceous syndrome. See also BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Hamartomas</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hamartomas, like choristomas, are benign congenital proliferations; but in contrast to choristomas, they are abnormal overgrowths of mature tissue normally present at a given topographic location (hence the derivation from the Greek word for “defect or error”). In the conjunctiva, the most common variety of hamartoma is a <span class="italic">capillary hemangioma,</span> although this hamartoma most often involves the eyelid (see Chapter&#160;13).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Inflammations</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top3>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Because part of the conjunctiva is an exposed surface, it can be affected by a variety of organisms, allergens, and toxic agents, which can initiate an inflammatory response, referred to as <span class="italic">conjunctivitis.</span> The response can be categorized as follows, based on the time frame, the constituents of the inflammatory infiltrate, macroscopic and microscopic appearance of the conjunctiva, or etiology</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-3">acute or chronic</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">papillary, follicular, or granulomatous</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-4">infectious or noninfectious</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> and Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for additional discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Papillary Versus Follicular Conjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most cases of conjunctivitis may be categorized as either papillary or follicular, according to the macroscopic and microscopic appearance of the conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-3</span>). Neither type is pathognomonic for a particular disease entity. Clinically, <span class="italic">papillary conjunctivitis</span> shows a cobblestone arrangement of flattened nodules with central vascular cores (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-4A</span>). Histologically, papillae appear as closely packed, flat-&#173;topped projections, with numerous inflammatory cells in the stroma surrounding a central vascular channel (Fig&#160;5-4B).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Follicular conjunctivitis</span> is characterized by the presence of follicles (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-5A</span>): small, pale, dome-shaped nodules without a prominent central vessel. Histologically, a lymphoid follicle appears as a stromal, nodular aggregate of lymphocytes, occasionally arranged in a germinal center with a surrounding mantle zone (Fig&#160;5-5B).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Granulomatous Conjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Granulomatous conjunctivitis is less common than papillary conjunctivitis and follicular conjunctivitis and has both infectious and noninfectious causes. Clinically, the nodular elevations of granulomatous conjunctivitis may be difficult to distinguish from follicles, but the clinical history and systemic symptoms may point to the diagnosis. Granulomatous conjunctivitis occurring in association with preauricular lymphadenopathy is known as <span class="italic">Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome.</span> Bacteria such as <span class="italic">Bartonella henselae</span> (cat-scratch disease) and <span class="italic">Francisella tularensis</span> (tularemia), mycobacteria (eg, <span class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span>), treponemes (eg, syphilis), and fungi (eg, sporotrichosis) are possible causes. Microorganisms may be demonstrated with Gram, acid-fast, or silver stains, depending on the organism. The diagnosis can be made based on the culture results, serologic testing, PCR analysis, or a combination of these. If conjunctival biopsy is performed, the granulomas in infectious granulomatous conjunctivitis will typically demonstrate central necrosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">One, presumably noninfectious cause of granulomatous conjunctivitis is <span class="italic">sarcoidosis,</span> a systemic disease that may involve all ocular tissues, including the conjunctiva. It manifests as small tan nodules without overt inflammatory signs, primarily within the forniceal conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-6A</span>). Conjunctival biopsy can be a simple, expedient way of providing diagnostic confirmation of this systemic disease. Histologically, noncaseating granulomatous “tubercles” (round to oval aggregates of epithelioid histiocytes with or without multinucleated giant cells) are present within the conjunctival stroma, typically with a minimal cuff of lymphocytes and plasma cells (Fig&#160;5-6B). Central necrosis is not characteristic and, if present, should suggest infectious etiologies. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is tenable only when supported by clinical findings and after infectious causes of granulomatous inflammation have been excluded by histochemical stains and/or by culture results. As an exposed surface, the conjunctiva is vulnerable to contact with foreign bodies. Some may be transient and/or inert, whereas others may become embedded and incite a foreign-&#173;body reaction, identifiable histologically as a granuloma surrounding the foreign object. Multinucleated giant cells are common. Viewing the tissue section under polarized light may be helpful in identifying the offending foreign material (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-7</span>). See Chapter&#160;12 in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for additional discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Infectious Conjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A wide variety of pathogens may infect the conjunctiva, including viruses, bacteria, atypical bacteria (eg, chlamydiae), fungi, and parasites. The most common offending agents in children are bacteria <span class="italic">(Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae)</span> and, in adults, viruses (adenovirus and the herpesviruses [simplex and zoster]). Specific diagnosis of infectious conjunctivitis may be made based on clinical history and examination findings (typically sufficient for viral disease), or it may require special stains for microorganisms (eg, Gram, Giemsa), culture, PCR analysis, or serology, depending on the organism. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty or cases unresponsive to initial treatment, cytologic evaluation of ocular surface epithelium (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-8</span>) or tissue biopsy may be helpful in establishing a definitive diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Noninfectious Conjunctivitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Toxic follicular conjunctivitis, most etiologies of papillary conjunctivitis, and some forms of granulomatous conjunctivitis are noninfectious.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP; also known as ocular cicatricial pemphigoid) is a form of cicatrizing conjunctivitis that is of autoimmune etiology. Typically, it involves not only the conjunctiva, but other mucous membranes as well; in approximately 25% of patients, MMP involves the skin. When this diagnosis is suspected clinically, conjunctival biopsy is performed to establish the diagnosis. Half of the specimen should be submitted in formalin for routine histologic examination and half submitted in a special medium (Michel or Zeus) or saline for direct immunofluorescence analysis. Histologic findings are generally nonspecific but typically show a subepithelial, bandlike, mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate rich in plasma cells. The overlying epithelium may demonstrate squamous metaplasia with loss of goblet cells. Bullae are occasionally present (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-9</span>). Immunofluorescence is the gold standard for diagnosis and demonstrates a linear deposition of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and/or IgA) and/or complement (C3) in the epithelial basement membrane zone. The clinician must bear in mind that the sensitivity of immunofluorescence may be as low as 50% (particularly in long-&#173;standing cases with severe cicatrization). Thus, a negative result does not rule out the possibility <br />of MMP.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Pyogenic Granuloma (Exuberant Granulation Tissue)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pyogenic granuloma appears as a fleshy, pedunculated, nodular elevation on the ocular surface, typically occurring in association with a chalazion (on the palpebral conjunctiva) or at a site of prior accidental or surgical trauma. The name of this condition is a misnomer because the lesion is not pus-&#173;producing and is not a true granuloma. Rather, pyogenic granuloma is exuberant granulation tissue composed of a mixture of acute and chronic inflammatory cells with proliferating capillaries that classically form a radiating or “spoke-wheel” pattern (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-10</span>).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Degenerations</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Pinguecula and Pterygium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A <span class="italic">pinguecula</span> is a small, yellowish nodule, often bilateral and typically located at the nasal and/or temporal limbus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-11A</span>). A manifestation of actinic damage (exposure to sunlight) or other environmental trauma, such as dust and wind, this growth is more common with advancing years. On histologic examination, the stromal collagen shows fragmentation and basophilic degeneration, referred to as <span class="italic">elastotic degeneration</span> because the degenerated collagen stains positively with histochemical stains for elastic fibers such as the Verhoeff–van Gieson stain (Fig&#160;5-11B,&#160;C).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">pterygium</span> is similar to a pinguecula in its etiology and location but differs from the latter in its invasion of the superficial cornea as a vascular, wing-shaped growth (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-12A</span>). Histologic examination typically shows elastotic degeneration, as in a pinguecula; prominent blood vessels correlating with the vascularity seen clinically (Fig&#160;5-12B,&#160;C); and variable degrees of chronic inflammation. So-called <span class="italic">recurrent pterygia</span> may completely lack the histologic feature of elastotic degeneration and are thus more accurately classified as an exuberant fibroconnective tissue response.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In pingueculae and pterygia, the overlying epithelium may exhibit mild squamous metaplasia, for example, loss of goblet cells and surface keratinization. Some studies have demonstrated that there is abnormal expression of Ki-67 (a proliferation marker); dysregulation of tumor suppressor genes, such as <span class="italic">p53</span> and <span class="italic">p63,</span> and other genes associated with DNA repair; cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis; loss of heterozygosity; and microsatellite instability. Thus, as with actinic damage to the skin, there is the potential for future malignant transformation, although this occurs only in rare cases in association with pingueculae and pterygia. When conjunctival squamous neoplasia arises, it often occurs overlying an area of preexisting elastotic degeneration. If features such as epithelial hyperplasia, nuclear hyperchromasia and pleomorphism, and excessive mitotic figures are identified in an excised pinguecula or pterygium, a diagnosis of ocular surface squamous neoplasia should be assigned (see the section “Ocular surface squamous neoplasia,” later in this chapter). See also BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span></p>

			<p class="h2">Amyloid Deposits</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Amyloid deposition in the conjunctiva is most commonly an idiopathic (primary) localized process seen in healthy young and middle-&#173;aged adults. The deposits are typically composed of monoclonal immunoglobulin (AL&#160;amyloid), secreted by local clonal plasma cells. Less often, conjunctival amyloidosis is induced by long-&#173;standing inflammation, such as with trachoma (ie, secondary localized amyloidosis, AA&#160;amyloid). Occasionally, conjunctival amyloidosis may occur in the setting of primary conjunctival lymphoma or plasmacytoma or secondary to systemic lymphoma or plasma cell myeloma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinically, conjunctival amyloidosis typically presents as a salmon-&#173;colored nodular elevation, which can be associated with hemorrhage (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-13A</span>). Histologically, amyloid appears as eosinophilic extracellular deposits within the stroma, sometimes in a perivascular distribution. On Congo red stain, under standard light, amyloid deposits appear orange. When viewed with polarized light and a rotating polarization filter, they exhibit birefringence with dichroism; that is, they change from orange to apple green as the filter is rotated (Fig&#160;5-13B–D). Other useful staining methods include crystal violet and the fluorescent stain thioflavin&#160;T. Electron microscopy shows characteristic fibrils (see Chapter&#160;6, Fig&#160;6-19D). Immunohistochemical methods, sequencing, and mass spectrometry–based proteomic analysis are some of the techniques that are used in amyloid subtyping.

			<p class="h2">Epithelial Inclusion Cyst</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A conjunctival epithelial inclusion cyst may form at a site of prior accidental or surgical trauma (eg, after strabismus surgery, retinal surgery, or enucleation). Clinically, the lesion appears as a transparent, cystic elevation on the ocular surface. There may be associated injection (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-14</span>). Histologic examination shows a cystic space lined by conjunctival epithelium, located in the stroma. The lumen may be empty or may contain inspissated proteinaceous material and cellular debris.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Neoplasia</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Squamous Lesions</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Squamous papillomas</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common ocular surface neoplasms are those of the squamous family. Squamous papillomas may be divided clinically into pedunculated and sessile subtypes.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Pedunculated papillomas</span> are exophytic, pink-red, strawberry-&#173;like papillary growths frequently localized to the caruncle (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-15A</span>), plica semilunaris, or forniceal conjunctiva. They occur more commonly in children than adults, with multiple lesions often present in affected patients. Pedunculated papillomas are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, subtypes&#160;6 and&#160;11. Histologic examination of a pedunculated papilloma demonstrates papillary fibrovascular cores covered by hyperplastic squamous epithelium (Fig&#160;5-15B). Goblet cells may be present as in normal conjunctival epithelium. If there is overlying tear film disruption resulting in exposure, the number of goblet cells may be reduced and the surface keratinized. Neutrophils may be seen within the epithelium, and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate is frequently present in the stroma. Pedunculated papillomas typically exhibit benign behavior.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Sessile papillomas</span> typically arise on the bulbar conjunctiva, especially adjacent to the limbus, and occur more commonly in adults. These papillomas are associated with HPV infection, subtypes&#160;16 and&#160;18—the same subtypes associated with squamous neoplasia. Clinical features worrisome for malignant transformation include leukoplakia (white patch indicative of keratinization), inflammation, atypical vascularity, and corneal involvement. Histologically, a sessile papilloma exhibits a broad base and lacks the prominent <br />fingerlike projections seen in a pedunculated papilloma. The epithelium is hyperplastic but lacks prominent atypia. Evidence of nuclear hyperchromasia and pleomorphism, altered cell polarity, and abundant mitotic figures suggest a diagnosis of ocular surface squamous neoplasia.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Ocular surface squamous neoplasia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN)</span> comprises a wide spectrum of dysplastic changes of the ocular surface epithelium, including corneal and conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). OSSN typically arises in the interpalpebral limbal area. The prevalence of OSSN is higher in equatorial regions of the world. UV-light exposure, especially in individuals with light skin pigmentation, is a known risk factor for OSSN. Mutations associated with UV&#160;light occur in tumor suppressor genes such as <span class="italic">p53</span> and have been demonstrated in OSSN. A hereditary deficiency of DNA repair (as occurs in xeroderma pigmentosum) increases the risk of OSSN formation. OSSN is also associated with HPV infection (subtypes&#160;16 and&#160;18) and with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV-&#173;associated OSSN may demonstrate rapid growth and aggressive behavior; HIV should be suspected in any OSSN patient younger than 50&#160;years. Non–HIV-&#173;related immunosuppression is also a risk factor for OSSN. Other risk factors include older age and smoking.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical appearance of OSSN is characterized by epithelial thickening, with the ocular surface appearing gelatinous or leukoplakic; the lesion may extend onto the peripheral cornea. There may be a prominent “corkscrew” vascular pattern with feeder vessels leading to the lesion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-16</span>). Histologically, the epithelium exhibits hyperplasia, loss of goblet cells, loss of cell polarity, nuclear hyperchromasia and pleomorphism, and mitotic figures. Frequently, there is surface keratinization, which correlates with the leukoplakia observed clinically. A chronic inflammatory response and increased vascularity are often present in the stroma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most important assessment to be made histologically in OSSN is whether the neoplasia is contained by the basement membrane (ie, intraepithelial or in situ) or whether neoplastic cells have traversed the epithelial basement membrane and invaded the stroma. For lesions contained by the basement membrane, the term <span class="italic">conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)</span> is used. The neoplasia may be graded as mild, moderate, or severe according to the degree of cellular atypia. In cases with the most severe atypia, there is full-&#173;thickness involvement of the epithelium, often with squamous eddies or keratin whorls or pearls. For these more advanced lesions, the term <span class="italic">squamous carcinoma in situ</span> is used. Invasion of the stroma by neoplastic cells is diagnostic of <span class="italic">squamous cell carcinoma</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-17</span>; see also Fig&#160;5-16D). Invasion through the sclera or cornea with intraocular spread is an uncommon complication of invasive squamous cell carcinoma, typically occurring at the site of a previous surgical procedure or in the setting of immunosuppression. In addition, rare variants of conjunctival carcinoma, <span class="italic">mucoepidermoid carcinoma</span> and <span class="italic">spindle cell carcinoma,</span> may demonstrate aggressive behavior, with higher rates of recurrence, intraocular spread, and orbital invasion. Although regional lymph node metastasis is not as common in OSSN with conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma as it is with squamous carcinomas of the skin or other sites, dissemination and death can occur.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Melanocytic Lesions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-table">Table&#160;5-1</span> summarizes key clinical features of the main types of ocular surface melanocytic lesions.</p>
			<p class="h3">Melanocytic nevi</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As with hemangiomas, <span class="italic">melanocytic nevi</span> are classified by some authors as hamartomas and by others as neoplasms, with this distinction resting upon whether the lesion is congenital or acquired. Conjunctival melanocytic nevi usually arise in childhood, appearing on the bulbar conjunctiva as circumscribed pigmented lesions, frequently incorporating small, clear epithelial inclusion cysts (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-18A</span>). Nevi also occur fairly commonly in the caruncle. Conjunctival nevi may be nonpigmented <span class="italic">(amelanotic),</span> in which case they have a pinkish appearance and the clinical diagnosis may be more challenging. The pigmentation and size of a nevus may increase during puberty, at which point the lesion may first be noticed. Melanocytic nevi occur only rarely in the palpebral conjunctiva; pigmented lesions in this area are more likely to represent intraepithelial melanosis or melanoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Like cutaneous melanocytic nevi, nevocellular conjunctival nevi undergo evolutionary changes. In the initial junctional phase, nevus cells are arranged in nests <span class="italic">(theques)</span> at the interface (junction) between the epithelium and the stroma. As the nevus evolves, the nests descend into the stroma and may lose connection with the epithelium. Nevus cells residing exclusively at the epithelial–stromal junction are called <span class="italic">junctional nevi,</span> whereas nevi located exclusively in the stroma are termed <span class="italic">subepithelial</span> or <span class="italic">stromal nevi;</span> nevi with both junctional and subepithelial components are designated <span class="italic">compound nevi.</span> Epithelial inclusion cysts are often encountered within compound nevi. The presence of these cysts, in conjunction with melanocytes exhibiting a nested pattern, is a histologic feature of a benign lesion (Fig&#160;5-18B).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nevi can be further categorized, for example, into Spitz nevus, halo nevus, and blue nevus. A blue nevus is a dark blue-gray to blue-black nevus in which the melanocytes are located in the deep stroma and have spindly morphology, similar to that of nevus cells seen in the uveal tract. Ocular, dermal, and oculodermal melanocytosis are forms of blue nevi typically seen unilaterally in darkly pigmented individuals (eg, African, Hispanic, and Asian persons). In <span class="italic">ocular melanocytosis,</span> the nevus is located in the deep episclera and sclera, giving the ocular surface a slate-gray appearance (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-19</span>), and also in the uveal tract, often resulting in iris heterochromia; the conjunctiva (epithelium and stroma) is uninvolved. In <span class="italic">dermal melanocytosis,</span> the nevus is located in the periocular skin. Dermal melanocytosis may also occur in conjunction with orbital melanocytosis, that is, <span class="italic">dermal orbital melanocytosis.</span> <span class="italic">Oculodermal melanocytosis,</span> also known as <span class="italic">nevus of Ota,</span> combines the features of ocular and dermal melanocytosis. Although these conditions are rare in lightly pigmented persons, the risk of malignant transformation is increased in these indi&#173;viduals. When transformation into melanoma occurs, it is generally seen in the uveal tract; cutaneous, orbital, and meningeal melanomas are rare. Recent studies have shown that nevi of Ota manifest the same mutation in the G&#160;protein <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-subunit genes <span class="italic">(GNAQ</span> and <span class="italic">GNA11)</span> that primary ciliochoroidal and central nervous system melanomas do. See also Chapter&#160;17 in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Intraepithelial melanosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Classification of non-&#173;nevoid conjunctival melanocytic proliferations is unique to this anatomical location and has been a subject of ongoing debate and critique. Traditionally, the acquired conjunctival pigmentation has been referred to as melanosis. Melanosis is divided into <span class="italic">primary acquired melanosis (PAM),</span> which occurs without predisposing conditions; <span class="italic">secondary acquired melanosis,</span> which occurs in a setting of systemic disease (eg, Addison disease) or secondary to another conjunctival lesion (eg, squamous papilloma or carcinoma); and <span class="italic">complexion-&#173;associated melanosis,</span> which occurs in individuals with darker complexions. PAM is further divided into <span class="italic">PAM without atypia</span> and <span class="italic">PAM with atypia.</span> The concept of PAM with atypia is controversial, as it denotes a spectrum of lesions—from those showing only mild cytologic atypia to severely atypical lesions frequently associated with invasive melanoma—and the precise definition of melanoma in situ is lacking. In an effort to distinguish between conjunctival hyperpigmentation and melanocytic proliferation and to standardize the grading of intraepithelial melanocytic proliferations, a new classification scheme has been proposed, one that divides conjunctival melanosis into <span class="italic">hypermelanosis, conjunctival melanocytic intraepithelial neoplasia (C-MIN),</span> and <span class="italic">melanoma in situ.</span> In the absence of universal terminology, both classification schemes are incorporated into the following discussion.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Complexion-&#173;associated melanosis</span> appears as bilateral flat patches of brown pigmentation with irregular margins, typically involving the bulbar and limbal conjunctiva, in individuals with dark skin pigmentation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-20A</span>). Streaks and whorls of melanotic pigmentation may extend onto the peripheral cornea, a condition called <span class="italic">striate melanokeratosis.</span> The caruncle and palpebral conjunctiva may also be involved. Histologically, there is increased pigmentation, localized primarily to the epithelial cells; the basal epithelial melanocytes are normal in number and cytomorphology (hence the proposed new term, hypermelanosis) (Fig&#160;5-20B).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Secondary acquired melanosis is similarly characterized by increased pigmentation in the absence of melanocytic atypia. The number of melanocytes may be mildly increased, however; this increase is triggered by the underlying conjunctival inflammatory or neoplastic process. Both complexion-&#173;associated melanosis and secondary acquired melanosis have no significant risk of progression to melanoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In contrast, PAM characteristically presents as a unilateral melanotic macule or patch in middle-&#173;aged light-&#173;skinned individuals. The lesion may remain stable or grow slowly over a period of 10 or more years. It may be difficult to predict clinically in any given patient whether PAM is likely to progress to melanoma; thus, the recommendations regarding when to observe versus when to perform biopsy are controversial. Retrospective data suggest that the number of clock-hours of conjunctival involvement (3&#160;clock-hours or more) and caruncular, forniceal, or palpebral conjunctival locations are associated with a worse prognosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-21</span>). Histologic criteria have been developed to identify patients at high risk for malignancy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">PAM without atypia is characterized by a normal or mildly increased number of cytologically unremarkable melanocytes along the basal epithelial layer, with the pigment, when present, being localized mainly to the epithelial cells (see Fig&#160;5-21B). Thus, without the clinical history, the pathologist may not be able to distinguish PAM without atypia from complexion-&#173;associated melanosis or secondary acquired melanosis, as the histologic findings for these conditions may be identical. According to the proposed classification scheme, lesions lacking melanocytic hyperplasia or atypia are classified as <span class="italic">primary conjunctival hypermelanosis</span> (see Fig&#160;5-20B), whereas those composed of a lentiginous proliferation of basal melanocytes (which are occasionally mildly enlarged) lacking cytologic atypia are termed <span class="italic">C-MIN without atypia</span> (see Fig&#160;5-21B).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In PAM with atypia <span class="italic">(C-MIN with atypia),</span> melanocytes are cytologically atypical; they form nests, demonstrate discohesiveness, and migrate into the more superficial epithelium <span class="italic">(pagetoid spread).</span> The cells often exhibit epithelioid morphology, with large hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and moderate to abundant cytoplasm. Mitotic figures may be present. A chronic inflammatory response is frequently seen in the stroma. The atypia may be graded as mild, moderate, or severe, although there is poor interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of such grading. Typically, basilar lentiginous, mildly atypical dendritic melanocytic proliferations are graded as <span class="italic">PAM with mild atypia,</span> whereas those demonstrating pagetoid spread and epithelioid cytomorphology are categorized as <span class="italic">PAM with moderate to severe atypia.</span> According to the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, involvement of greater than 75% of the conjunctival epithelium by atypical epithelioid melanocytes and/or presence of pagetoid spread are defining features of <span class="italic">conjunctival melanoma in situ</span> (see Fig&#160;5-21E–F). PAM with mild atypia carries minimal, if any, risk of malignant transformation. In contrast, PAM with moderate or severe atypia carries a substantial risk of progression to melanoma.</p>

			<p class="h3">Melanoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 50%–70% of cases of <span class="italic">conjunctival melanoma</span> arise from PAM with atypia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-22</span>); the remainder develop from either a nevus or de novo. Melanomas are usually nodular growths with vascularity that may involve any portion of the conjunctiva. The nodule may be pigmented or amelanotic. Histologically, the cellular morphology in melanomas ranges from spindle to epithelioid (see Fig&#160;5-22B). These cytologic features do not have the same prognostic significance that they have in uveal melanoma. In more aggressive lesions, mitotic figures may present. Immunohistochemical stains for melanocytes such as Melan-A (MART-1) and HMB-45, ideally complexed with red chromogen, may be of help in diagnostically challenging cases. Conjunctival melanomas metastasize to regional lymph nodes in 25% of patients, as well as to the lungs, liver, brain, bone, and skin. The overall mortality rate in these cases ranges from 15% to 30%. Histologic features associated with a worse prognosis include nonbulbar conjunctival location (ie, plica semilunaris/caruncle, forniceal or palpebral conjunctiva, palpebral conjunctiva) and greater tumor thickness.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Occasionally, extrascleral extension of an anterior uveal melanoma presents as an episcleral/conjunctival mass. This diagnosis should be considered, particularly for a nonmobile pigmented or amelanotic episcleral nodule overlying the ciliary body that is associated with sentinel vessels and without surrounding PAM (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-23</span>). A complete eye examination, including gonioscopy and dilated ophthalmoscopy, should always be performed in any patient with a conjunctival mass. In individuals with darker complexions, conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma may occasionally be associated with reactive pigmentation, masquerading as melanoma.

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Lymphoid Lesions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The normal conjunctiva contains MALT, and a few small follicles are often visible clinically in the normal inferior fornix. As described previously, the reactive lymphoid follicle consists of a germinal center and surrounding corona (see Fig&#160;5-5). The corona is divided into marginal and mantle zones, although these zones are not well delineated histologically without the use of immunohistochemical stains.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lymphoid tissue may proliferate in the conjunctiva abnormally, often in the absence of inflammation, and this lymphoid hyperplasia may be benign (reactive) or malignant. Clinically, both benign and malignant lymphoproliferative conjunctival lesions appear as soft, mobile, salmon-&#173;pink masses with a smooth-&#173;surface, characteristically localized to the forniceal and the bulbar conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-24A,&#160;B</span>). The condition may be unilateral or bilateral, and an orbital component may be present. Incisional biopsy is generally required to make a precise diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Evaluation of conjunctival lymphoid lesions is limited by the size of the biopsy specimen. Thus, communication with the pathologist regarding recommendations for optimal specimen submission is essential. Histologic examination and immunohistochemistry are routinely used in the workup. When the submitted tissue is sufficient for additional studies, flow cytometry and molecular genetic studies can also be performed (see Chapters&#160;3 and&#160;4).</p>
			<p class="body-text">On routine hematoxylin-&#173;eosin sections, histologic features favoring a diagnosis of <span class="italic">benign lymphoid hyperplasia</span> include the presence of normal-&#173;appearing lymphoid follicles with distinct germinal centers and with small, mature coronal lymphocytes (Fig&#160;5-24C). In contrast, <span class="italic">lymphoma</span> frequently demonstrates a diffuse or vaguely nodular proliferation of monomorphic lymphocytes in the stroma, without well-defined follicles (Fig&#160;5-24D). As is true for most ocular adnexal lymphomas, conjunctival lymphoma is often a low-grade small B-cell lymphoma, classified as extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type (MALT lymphoma) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-25</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Of all ocular adnexal lymphomas, conjunctival lymphoma has the best prognosis, as approximately 80% of conjunctival lymphomas are localized to the conjunctiva and not associated with systemic disease. See BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> and Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> for additional discussion.</p>

			<p class="h2">Glandular Lesions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Oncocytoma</span> is a benign proliferation of apocrine or accessory lacrimal gland epithelium, that is, an adenoma. It typically arises in the caruncle, but it may occasionally be located elsewhere on the conjunctiva. Oncocytoma most commonly occurs in elderly women. Clinically, it appears as a tan to reddish, vascularized nodule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-26</span>). Histologically, the lesion is composed of a cystadenomatous proliferation of columnar epithelium with abundant, intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm (reflecting the presence of numerous mitochondria) and granular eosinophilic material in the lumen.</p>
			<p class="h2">Other Neoplasms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Virtually any neoplasm that can occur in the orbit and eyelid skin can occur, though less frequently, in the conjunctiva, including sebaceous, neural, muscular, vascular, and fibrocytic tumors. Metastatic lesions to the conjunctiva are rare. Orbital neoplasms are discussed in Chapter&#160;14.
