			<p class="h2-h1">Bony Orbit and Soft Tissues</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Seven bones form the boundaries of the orbit (see Figs&#160;1-1 through 1-3 in BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System</span>). They are the ethmoidal, frontal, lacrimal, maxillary, palatine, sphenoid, and zygomatic bones.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The orbital cavity contains the globe, lacrimal gland, muscles, tendons, fat, fasciae, vessels, nerves, ciliary ganglion, and cartilaginous trochlea. Inflammatory and neoplastic processes that increase the volume of the orbital contents lead to <span class="italic">proptosis</span> (protrusion) of the globe and/or <span class="italic">displacement</span> (deviation) from the horizontal or vertical position. The degree and direction of ocular displacement help to localize the position of the mass.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">lacrimal gland</span> is situated anteriorly in the superotemporal quadrant of the orbit. The gland is divided into orbital and palpebral lobes by the aponeurosis of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The lacrimal gland acini are composed of low cuboidal epithelium. The ducts, which lie within the fibrovascular stroma, are lined by low cuboidal epithelium and a second outer layer of low, flat myoepithelial cells. See BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> and Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> for additional discussion.</p>

            <div id="Chapt14_Top2">
                <p class="h2-h1">Cysts</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although some cysts are congenital, there are also acquired cysts. The major categories of orbital cysts include cysts of the surface epithelium, teratomatous cysts, neural cysts, secondary cysts (mucoceles), inflammatory cysts (parasitic), and noncystic lesions with a cystic component.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Congenital dermoid cysts are believed to develop as embryonic epithelial nests that become entrapped during embryogenesis. Most manifest in childhood as a mass in the lateral brow. Cyst rupture may produce a marked granulomatous reaction. Histologically, a dermoid cyst is lined by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium and contains keratin, sebum, and hair. By definition, its walls contain dermal elements, including sebaceous glands, hair follicles, and sweat glands (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-1</span>). If the cyst wall does not have adnexal structures, the term <span class="italic">simple epithelial (epidermoid) cyst</span> is applied. Simple epithelial cysts may also be lined by respiratory, conjunctival, or apocrine epithelium.</p>
            </div>
			<p class="h1">Inflammations</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital inflammation may be idiopathic or secondary to a systemic inflammatory disease (eg, Graves disease), a retained foreign body, or infectious disease. Orbital inflammation includes diffuse inflammation of multiple tissues (eg, sclerosing orbititis, diffuse anterior inflammation) and preferential involvement of specific orbital structures (eg, orbital myositis, optic perineuritis). Conditions masquerading as orbital inflammation include congenital orbital mass lesions and orbital neoplastic disease, such as lymphoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.</p>
			<p class="h2">Noninfectious</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Nonspecific orbital inflammation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI) refers to a space-&#173;occupying inflammatory disorder that simulates a neoplasm (thus, it is sometimes known as <span class="italic">orbital pseudotumor</span>) but has no recognizable cause. This disorder accounts for approximately 5% of orbital lesions. Clinically, patients have an abrupt onset and usually report pain. The condition may affect children as well as adults. The inflammatory response may be diffuse or compartmentalized. When localized to an extraocular muscle, the condition is called <span class="italic">orbital myositis</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-2</span>); when localized to the lacrimal gland, it is called <span class="italic">dacryoadenitis.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">In the early stages of NSOI, inflammation predominates, with a polymorphous inflammatory response (eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages) that is often perivascular and that frequently infiltrates muscle and fat, producing fat necrosis. In later stages, fibrosis is the predominant feature, often with interspersed lymphoid follicles bearing germinal centers. The fibrosis may replace orbital fat and encase extraocular muscles and the optic nerve (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-3</span>). Immunophenotypic and molecular genetic analyses can differentiate NSOI from lymphoid tumors based on whether the proliferation of lymphocytes is polyclonal (NSOI) or monoclonal (lymphoma). CD20 and CD25 receptors have been found in cases of NSOI and may provide the basis for future treatments. Immunoglobulin&#160;G4 (IgG4)–positive plasmacytic infiltrates have recently become a marker for a sclerosing variant of fibroinflammatory diseases. The nature of the pathologic findings dictates the recommended treatment. See also BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>

			<p class="h3">Thyroid eye disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Thyroid eye disease (TED)</span> (also known as <span class="italic">Graves disease,</span> <span class="italic">thyroid ophthalmopathy, thyroid-&#173;associated orbitopathy,</span> and <span class="italic">Basedow disease</span>) is related to thyroid dysfunction and is the most common cause of unilateral or bilateral proptosis (exophthalmos) in adults. Signs and symptoms of TED are related to inflammation of the orbital connective tissue, inflammation and fibrosis of the extraocular muscles, and adipogenesis. The muscles appear firm and white, and the tendons are usually not involved. A cellular infiltrate of mononuclear inflammatory cells (eg, lymphocytes, plasma cells, mast cells) and fibroblasts involves the interstitial tissues of the extraocular muscles, most commonly the inferior and medial rectus muscles (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-4</span>). The fibroblasts synthesize hyaluronan and other glycosaminoglycans.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because orbital fibrocytes (considered precursor cells of fibroblasts) are derived from the neural crest and are pluripotent, the enhanced signaling promotes adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis. For more discussion of the molecular process of TED development, see BCSC Section&#160;1, <span class="italic">Update on General Medicine,</span> and Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">As a result of the increased bulk within the orbit, the optic nerve may be compromised at the orbital apex, and optic nerve head swelling may result. Late stages of TED are associated with progressive fibrosis that results in restriction of ocular movement and severe eyelid retraction with resultant exposure keratitis.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Infectious</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Bacterial infections</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The causes of bacterial infections of the orbit include bacteremia, trauma, retained surgical hardware, and, most commonly, spread from an adjacent sinus infection. Infection may involve a variety of organisms, including <span class="italic">Haemophilus influenzae,</span> <span class="italic">Streptococcus,</span> <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus,</span> <span class="italic">Clostridium,</span> <span class="italic">Bacteroides,</span> <span class="italic">Klebsiella,</span> and <span class="italic">Proteus.</span> Histologically, acute inflammation, necrosis, and abscess formation may be present. Tuberculosis, which rarely involves the orbit, produces a necrotizing granulomatous reaction.</p>
			<p class="h3">Fungal and parasitic infections</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rhinocerebral or rhino-orbito-&#173;cerebral zygomycosis (mucormycosis) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 14-5A</span>) usually occurs in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (especially those with ketoacidosis), solid malignant neoplasms, or extensive burns; in patients undergoing treatment with corticosteroid agents; or in patients with neutropenia related to hematologic malignant neoplasms. It usually represents spread from an adjacent sinus infection. Histologically, inflammation (acute and chronic) is present in a background of necrosis and is often granulomatous. Broad, nonseptate hyphae may be identified with hematoxylin-&#173;eosin, periodic acid–Schiff (PAS), and Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stains. These fungi can invade blood vessel walls and produce a thrombosing vasculitis and necrosis. Diagnosis is achieved by biopsy of necrotic-&#173;appearing tissues (eschar) in the nasopharynx.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> infection of the orbit from the adjacent sinuses may occur in immunocompromised or otherwise healthy individuals. With its slowly progressive and insidious symptoms, sino-&#173;orbital aspergillosis often goes unrecognized, producing a sclerosing granulomatous disease. <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> is often difficult to culture but may be observed in tissue as septate hyphae with 45° angle branching (Fig&#160;14-5). Despite aggressive surgical therapy and adjunct therapy with antifungal agents, if extension into the brain occurs, orbital infections due to <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> may be fatal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Allergic fungal sinusitis is a form of noninvasive fungal disease resulting from an IgE-&#173;mediated hypersensitivity reaction in atopic individuals. It is caused by several species of fungi. The disease may extend into the orbit and intracranially in some instances.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Parasitic infections of the orbit are rare. They may be produced by <span class="italic">Echinococcus</span> (orbital hydatid cyst), <span class="italic">Taenia solium</span> (cysticercosis), and <span class="italic">Loa loa</span> (ocular filariasis). These infections are seen mostly in patients who come from, or have traveled to, areas where the infections are endemic. Enzyme-&#173;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serum antibodies may aid diagnosis. See BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Amyloid</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Amyloid deposition in the orbit occurs in primary systemic amyloidosis. When it involves the extraocular muscles and nerves, it can cause ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. See Chapters&#160;5, 6, 10, and 13 in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span></p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Neoplasia</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neoplasms of the orbit may be primary or secondary (extensions from adjacent structures or metastatic disease). Secondary tumors are slightly more common than primary tumors. (See the section Secondary Tumors later in this chapter.) Children and adults are affected by different varieties of orbital tumors. Vascular and lymphoid tumors are the primary orbital lesions most often encountered in adults, and congenital tumors are the primary orbital lesions most often encountered in children.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In children, approximately 90% of orbital tumors are benign. Benign cystic lesions (dermoid or simple epithelial cysts) represent 50% of orbital lesions in childhood. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common orbital malignant tumor in childhood; it represents 3% of all orbital masses. The orbit may be involved secondarily in cases of retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and leukemia/lymphoma. See BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> for additional discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lacrimal Sac Neoplasia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lacrimal sac neoplasms are rare. In one study of patients undergoing dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) for chronic nasolacrimal duct obstruction, neoplasm was the cause in only 5% of cases. Most lacrimal sac tumors are papillomatous neoplasms that arise in the epithelial lining, but a wide variety have been reported.</p>

			<p class="h2">Lacrimal Gland Neoplasia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Because the lacrimal gland is a modified salivary gland, epithelial lacrimal gland tumors are classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) epithelial salivary gland classification system. The most common types of epithelial lacrimal gland tumors are pleomorphic adenoma, adenocarcinoma (carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma), and adenoid cystic carcinoma.</p>

			<p class="h3">Pleomorphic adenoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common epithelial tumor of the lacrimal gland is pleomorphic adenoma (benign mixed tumor). The tumor is pseudoencapsulated and grows slowly by expansion. This progressive expansive growth may excavate the bone of the lacrimal fossa. Tumor growth stimulates the periosteum to deposit a thin layer of new bone (ie, cortication). The adjacent orbital bone is not eroded. Typically, the patient experiences no pain. This tumor is slightly more common in men than in women, and the median age at presentation is 35&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, pleomorphic adenoma has a fibrous pseudocapsule and comprises a mixture of ductal-&#173;derived epithelial and stromal elements. The epithelial component may form nests or tubules lined by 2&#160;layers of cells, the outermost layer blending imperceptibly with the stroma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-6</span>). The stroma may appear myxoid and may contain heterologous elements, including cartilage and bone. Immunohistochemistry reflects the epithelial and myoepithelial components, both derived from epithelium. The tumor typically tests positive for keratin and epithelial membrane antigen in the ductal areas and positive for keratin, actin, myosin, fibronectin, and S-100 protein in the myoepithelial areas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chromosomal translocations are recognized in pleomorphic adenomas. Transformation into a malignant mixed tumor may take place in a long-&#173;standing or incompletely excised pleomorphic adenoma, with relatively rapid growth after a period of relative quiescence. Carcinomas, including adenocarcinoma (carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma) and adenoid cystic carcinoma, may also develop in recurrent pleomorphic adenomas.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Adenoid cystic carcinoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) can develop in a pleomorphic adenoma or de novo in the lacrimal gland. The tumor is slightly more common in women than in men, and the median age at presentation is about 40&#160;years. Unlike pleomorphic adenoma, ACC has no pseudocapsule; it tends to cause bone destruction and invade orbital nerves, accounting for the pain that is frequently reported on presentation. The gross appearance is grayish white, firm, and nodular. Histologic examination may reveal a variety of patterns, including the cribriform (Swiss cheese) pattern, which is the most common (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-7</span>). Other histologic patterns include basaloid (solid), comedocarcinoma, sclerosing, and tubular (ductal). Presence of a basaloid pattern has been associated with a worse prognosis (5-year survival rate of 20%) when compared with absence of a basaloid component (5-year survival rate of 70%). Immunohistochemistry is typically positive for S-100 protein, keratin, and actin, with areas of epithelial and myoepithelial differentiation. There is a positive correlation between prognosis and protein expression of Bcl-2 and BAX. Expression of p53 is associated with a poor prognosis. Exenteration is one of the currently accepted treatments for this tumor, but some advocate globe-&#173;sparing intra-&#173;arterial chemotherapy.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Lymphoproliferative Lesions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most classifications of lymphoid lesions have been based on lymph node architecture; therefore such nodal classifications have been difficult to apply to extranodal lymphoid lesions. In the ocular adnexa, the diagnosis of lymphoma involves identifying a monoclonal population of cells. Because there are no lymph nodes in the orbit, it is problematic to classify these lesions according to the criteria used for lymph nodes. The development of classification schemes for lymphomas is, thus, an ongoing and controversial process. In general, lymphoproliferative lesions are divided into reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH), atypical lymphoid hyperplasia (ALH), and ocular adnexal lymphoma (OAL). OAL is subtyped according to the <span class="italic">WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues.</span> Many lymphoid masses in the orbit that had previously been classified as reactive or atypical hyperplasia would now be considered neoplasia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Unlike patients with NSOI, those with orbital lymphoproliferative lesions present with gradual, painless progression of proptosis. Bilateral disease may occur; when it does, it heightens suspicion for systemic disease. Every patient with an orbital lymphoproliferative lesion should be staged in collaboration with a medical oncologist. Studies may include positron emission tomography (PET) scan and bone marrow biopsy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When taking a biopsy of an orbital or conjunctival lymphoproliferative lesion, the ophthalmologist should consult with the pathologist in advance to determine the optimal method for handling the tissue, including the type of fixative to use and the volume of tissue to obtain. Exposure of the biopsy specimen to air for long periods should be avoided. Tissue samples may be wrapped in saline-&#173;moistened gauze and transported on ice. It is very important that the tissue be handled gently; crush artifact can prevent the pathologist from rendering a diagnosis. Fresh (unfixed) tissue is required for touch preparations and flow cytometry. Gene rearrangement studies and immunohistochemistry can be performed on fixed tissue. See also Chapter&#160;4, Table&#160;4-1, for a checklist for requesting an ophthalmic pathologic consultation.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Lymphoid hyperplasia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is composed of well-&#173;differentiated lymphocytes with occasional plasma cells, macrophages, eosinophils, and follicles with germinal centers. The follicles usually contain tingible body macrophages (containing apoptotic debris), and there is mitotic activity; they also often have vessels with endothelial hyperplasia. Atypical lymphoid hyperplasia involves diffuse lymphoid proliferation, generally without reactive germinal centers. It is composed of an admixture of small, mature-&#173;appearing lymphocytes and larger lymphoid cells of unknown maturity. RLH and ALH are believed to represent one end of a continuum of lymphoproliferative lesions, with lymphoma at the other end.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Lymphoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lymphomas of the orbit may be a presenting manifestation of systemic lymphoma or may arise primarily from the orbit. Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-&#173;associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is the most common type of lymphoma seen in the orbit. These tumors are generally low-grade B-cell tumors with an excellent prognosis. Other types of lymphoma, such as follicular, large B-cell, and mantle cell lymphoma, occur in the orbit but with a lower incidence. Most of these are non-&#173;Hodgkin lymphomas, which constitute one-half of malignant tumors arising in the orbit and the ocular adnexa (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-8</span>). They have diffuse architecture and contain B-cells with immunopositivity for CD19 and CD20. T-cell lymphomas of the orbit are rare, more aggressive, and immunopositive for CD3, CD4, and CD8. The incidence of secondary orbital involvement in systemic lymphomas is approximately 1%–2%. Interestingly, the incidence of orbital lymphoma is increasing.</p>
			<p class="h2">Soft-Tissue Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Soft-tissue tumors are diagnosed both by recognition of the histologic patterns (ie, round cell, spindle cell, myxoid, epithelioid, pericytomatous, and pleomorphic) and by immunohistochemistry. The characteristic pathologic features of soft-&#173;tissue tumors are described on websites such as PathologyOutlines.com (www.pathologyoutlines.com/eye.html). Typically, a panel of immunohistochemical stains is used for the initial differentiation, and those results direct further studies; however, it may be challenging to classify these tumors.</p>
			<p class="h2">Vascular Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Orbital lymphatic malformations</span> (previously termed <span class="italic">lymphangiomas</span>) occur in children and are characterized by fluctuation in proptosis, often enlarging in the setting of illness. They are unencapsulated, diffusely infiltrating tumors that feature lymphatic vascular spaces and lymphoid aggregates in a fibrotic interstitium (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-9</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Hemangioma</span> in the adult is typically encapsulated and intraconal and consists of cavernous spaces <span class="italic">(cavernous hemangioma)</span> with variably thick, fibrosed walls (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-10</span>). Vessels may show thrombosis and calcification. Hemangioma in the child is unencapsulated and more cellular, often with a cutaneous component, and is composed of capillary-&#173;sized vessels <span class="italic">(capillary hemangioma).</span></p>

			<p class="h2">Tumors With Fibrous Differentiation</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Solitary fibrous tumor</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Solitary fibrous tumor is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the orbit in adults; presentation occurs in the fifth decade of life on average. Most patients present with an orbital mass causing a combination of symptoms, including proptosis, pain, diplopia, blurred vision, and epiphora. The superonasal orbit is a common site.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Recent research has demonstrated that hemangiopericytomas, fibrous histiocytomas, and giant cell angiofibromas of the orbit share several histologic characteristics and may be better categorized together under the heading of orbital solitary fibrous tumors. Two commonalities among all of these tumors are that they are collagen-&#173;rich, contain proliferating CD34-&#173;positive fibroblast-&#173;like cells, and often demonstrate strong nuclear STAT6 expression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Classically, the presence of staghorn sinusoidal blood vessels (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-11</span>) was used to distinguish hemangiopericytoma from other tumors; fibrous histiocytoma demonstrated spindle-&#173;shaped, plump histiocyte-&#173;like cells with a focal storiform architecture (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-12</span>); and giant cell angiofibroma was distinguished by the presence of multinucleated floret-&#173;type giant cells and angioectatic spaces. However, these findings overlap; for example, 87% of all fibrous tumors show staghorn vessels. Other shared histologic features may include mild hemorrhage, osteoclast-&#173;type cells, stromal myxoid change, mature adipocytes, and mineralization. The presence of overlapping features is the reason that the nomenclature of solitary fibrous tumor is preferred to define all of these tumors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most solitary fibrous tumors are benign, but marked cytologic atypia and increased mitotic activity, accentuated by strong staining for Ki-67 and/or p53, support the designation of borderline or low-grade malignant behavior.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other primary tumors of fibrous connective tissue include nodular fasciitis, fibroma, and fibrosarcoma.</p>

			<p class="h2">Tumors With Muscle Differentiation</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Rhabdomyosarcoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common primary malignant orbital tumor of childhood (average age at onset is 7–8&#160;years). Proptosis is often sudden and rapidly progressive; it requires emergency treatment. Reddish discoloration of the eyelids is <span class="italic">not</span> accompanied by local heat or systemic fever, as it is in cellulitis. Orbital rhabdomyosarcomas have a better prognosis (overall 5-year survival rate of about 90%) than do their extraorbital counterparts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Rhabdomyosarcomas arise from primitive mesenchymal cells that differentiate toward skeletal muscle. There are 3&#160;recognized histologic types of orbital rhabdomyosarcoma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-13</span>):</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma may develop in the conjunctiva and may present as grapelike submucosal clusters (ie, <span class="italic">botryoid varian</span><span class="italic">t</span>). Histologically, spindle cells are arranged in a loose syncytium with occasional cells bearing cross-&#173;striations. These cross-&#173;striations are found in approximately 60% of embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas. Well-&#173;differentiated rhabdomyosarcomas feature numerous cells with striking cross-&#173;striations. Immunohistochemical analysis is typically positive for desmin, muscle-&#173;specific actin, vimentin, and, less commonly, myogenin. Electron microscopy is helpful for demonstrating the typical sarcomeric banding pattern, especially in cases of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, which are not as well-&#173;differentiated. Cytogenetic studies are important for identifying genetic translocations such as <span class="italic">FOXO1,</span> which has prognostic implications.</p>

			<p class="h3">Leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tumors with smooth muscle differentiation are rare. <span class="italic">Leiomyomas</span> are benign tumors that typically manifest with slowly progressive proptosis in patients in the fourth or fifth decade of life. Histologically, these spindle cell tumors show blunt-&#173;ended, cigar-&#173;shaped nuclei and trichrome-&#173;positive filamentous cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry displays smooth muscle differentiation. <span class="italic">Leiomyosarcomas</span> are malignant lesions that typically occur in patients in their seventh decade. Histologically, these tumors show more cellularity, necrosis, and nuclear pleomorphism than their benign counterparts. Mitotic figures also appear in leiomyosarcomas but are typically absent in leiomyomas.</p>
			<p class="h2">Nerve Sheath Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Neurofibroma,</span> which is the most common nerve sheath tumor, is a slow-&#173;growing tumor that includes an admixture of endoneural fibroblasts, Schwann cells, and axons. Neurofibromas may be circumscribed but are not encapsulated. They are firm and rubbery. Microscopically, the spindle-&#173;shaped cells are arranged in ribbons and cords in a matrix of myxoid tissue and collagen that contains axons. Cytogenetic studies indicate that the most frequent structural rearrangements involve chromosome arm&#160;9p.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Isolated neurofibromas do not necessarily indicate systemic involvement, but the plexiform type of neurofibroma is associated with neurofibromatosis&#160;1 (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-14</span>). “Plexiform” refers to an intricate network, or “plexus,” classically described as a “bag of worms.” Studies indicate that a limited number of pathways are potentially involved in tumorigenesis of the plexiform neurofibroma. The <span class="italic">CCN1</span> gene may be a useful diagnostic or prognostic marker and form the basis for novel therapeutic strategies. The CCNs (cysteine-&#173;rich proteins) have been shown to occupy key roles as matricellular proteins, serving as adaptor molecules that connect the cell surface and the extracellular matrix.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">neurilemoma</span> (also called <span class="italic">schwannoma</span>) arises from Schwann cells. Slow growing and encapsulated, this yellowish tumor may show cysts and areas of hemorrhagic necrosis. It may be solitary or associated with neurofibromatosis. Two histologic patterns appear microscopically. Antoni A spindle cells are arranged in interlacing cords, whorls, or palisades that may form Verocay bodies (collections of fibrils resembling sensory corpuscles). The Antoni&#160;B pattern is made up of stellate cells that have a mucoid stroma. Vessels are usually prominent and thick-walled, and no axons are present (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-15</span>). Immunohistochemistry is typically positive for S-100 protein, vimentin, and CD68.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Lipomas</span> are rare in the orbit. Their pathologic characteristics include encapsulation and a distinctive lobular appearance. Because lipomas are histologically difficult to distinguish from normal or prolapsed fat, their incidence might previously have been overestimated.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Liposarcomas</span> are malignant tumors that are extremely rare in the orbit. Histologic criteria depend on the type of liposarcoma, but the unifying diagnostic feature is the presence of lipoblasts. These tumors tend to recur before they metastasize.</p>
			<p class="h2">Bony Lesions of the Orbit</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Fibrous dysplasia</span> of bone may be monostotic or polyostotic. When the orbit is affected, the condition is usually monostotic; the patient often presents during the first 3&#160;decades of life. The tumor may cross suture lines to involve multiple orbital bones. Narrowing of the optic canal and lacrimal drainage system can occur. Plain radiographic studies show a ground-glass appearance with lytic foci. Cysts that contain fluid also appear. As a result of arrest in the maturation of bone, trabeculae are composed of woven bone with a fibrous stroma that is highly vascularized rather than lamellar bone. The bony trabeculae often have a C-shaped appearance (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-16</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Fibro-osseous dysplasia (juvenile ossifying fibroma),</span> a variant of fibrous dysplasia, is characterized histologically by spicules of bone rimmed by osteoblasts (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-17</span>). At low magnification, ossifying fibroma may be confused with a psammomatous meningioma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Osseous and cartilaginous tumors are rare; of these, <span class="italic">osteoma</span> is the most common. It is slow growing and well circumscribed, and it is composed of mature bone. Most commonly, an osteoma arises from the frontal sinus. Other primary tumors in this group include</p>

			<p class="h2">Secondary Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Secondary</span> malignant orbital tumors are lesions that invade the orbit by direct extension from adjacent structures, such as sinus, bone, or eye. <span class="italic">Metastatic</span> tumors are malignant lesions that have spread from a distant primary site. The most common primary tumor sites involved in orbital metastasis are the breast in women and the prostate in men. In children, neuroblastoma is the most common primary tumor metastatic to the orbit.</p>
