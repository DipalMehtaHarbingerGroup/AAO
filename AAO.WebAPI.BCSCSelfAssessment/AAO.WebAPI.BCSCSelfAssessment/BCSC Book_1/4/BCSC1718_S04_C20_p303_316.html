			<p class="h2-h1">Metastatic Carcinoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Since the first description in 1872 of a metastatic tumor in the eye of a patient with carcinoma, a large body of literature has indicated that the most common type of intraocular or orbital tumor in adults is metastatic. Several comprehensive studies of ocular metastatic tumors have been conducted: some have reported the incidence of tumor metastases in a consecutive series in autopsies, some have dealt with tumor incidence in patients with generalized malignancy, and others have used a clinicopathologic approach. As long-term survival from systemic primary malignancy continues to increase, the ophthalmologist will be confronted with a growing incidence of intraocular and orbital metastatic disease requiring prompt recognition and appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic management.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Metastases to the eye are being diagnosed with increasing frequency for various reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2">increased incidence of certain tumor types that metastasize to the eye (eg, breast, lung)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">prolonged survival of patients with certain cancer types (eg, breast cancer)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">increased awareness among medical oncologists and ophthalmologists of the pattern of metastatic disease</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3">Primary tumor sites</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The majority of metastatic solid tumors to the eye are carcinomas from various organs. Cutaneous melanoma rarely metastasizes to the eye. <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;20-1</span> shows the most common primary tumors that metastasize to the choroid.</p>
			<p class="h3">Mechanisms of metastasis to the eye</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The mechanism of intraocular metastasis depends on the hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells. The anatomy of the arterial blood supply to the eye dictates the predilection of tumor cell deposits within the eye. The posterior choroid, with its rich vascular supply, is the most favored site of intraocular metastases; it is affected 10–20&#160;times as frequently as is the iris or ciliary body. The retina and optic nerve head, which are supplied by the single central retinal artery, are rarely the sole site of involvement. Bilateral ocular involvement has been reported in approximately 25% of cases, and multifocal deposits are frequently seen within the involved eye. Many patients with ocular metastases also have concurrent central nervous system (CNS) and pulmonary metastases (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;20-1</span>). Ocular metastatic lesions are sometimes found before a primary tumor is detected.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Clinical evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinical features of intraocular metastases depend on the site of involvement. Metastases to the iris and ciliary body usually appear as white or gray-white gelatinous nodules (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;20-2</span>, <span class="xref-figure">20-3</span>, <span class="xref-figure">20-4</span>). The clinical features of anterior uveal metastases may include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5">iridocyclitis</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">secondary glaucoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">rubeosis iridis</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">hyphema</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">irregular pupil</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anterior segment tumors are best evaluated with slit-lamp biomicroscopy coupled with gonioscopy. High-&#173;resolution ultrasound imaging may quantify tumor size and anatomical relationships.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with a tumor in the posterior pole commonly report painless loss of vision. Indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy may reveal a nonrhegmatogenous (ie, exudative) retinal detachment associated with a placoid amelanotic tumor mass (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;20-5</span>, <span class="xref-figure">20-6</span>, <span class="xref-figure">20-7</span>). These lesions are usually relatively flat and ill-&#173;defined, often gray-&#173;yellow or yellow-&#173;white, with secondary alterations at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) presenting as clumps of brown pigment (“leopard spots”; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;20-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The mushroom configuration seen in primary choroidal melanoma from breakthrough of Bruch membrane is rarely present in uveal metastases. The retina overlying the metastasis may appear opaque and become detached. Rapid tumor growth with necrosis and uveitis are occasionally observed. Dilated epibulbar vessels may be seen in the quadrant overlying the metastasis. For a differential diagnosis of choroidal metastasis, see <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;20-2</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3">Ancillary tests</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although <span class="italic">fluorescein angiography</span> may be helpful in defining the margins of a metastatic tumor, it is typically less useful in differentiating a metastasis from a primary intraocular neoplasm. The double circulation pattern and prominent early choroidal filling often seen in choroidal melanomas are rarely found in metastatic tumors.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Ultrasonography</span> is diagnostically valuable in patients with a metastatic tumor. B-scan ultrasonography shows an echogenic choroidal mass with an ill-&#173;defined, sometimes lobulated, outline (see Fig&#160;20-7C,&#160;D). Overlying secondary retinal detachment is commonly detected in these cases. A-scan ultrasonography demonstrates irregular reflectivity.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT)</span> may demonstrate a “lumpy, bumpy” contour, choriocapillaris compression, and photoreceptor loss.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Fine-&#173;needle aspiration biopsy</span> may be helpful in rare cases when the diagnosis cannot be established by noninvasive procedures. Although metastatic tumors may recapitulate the histology of the primary tumor, they are often less differentiated. Special histochemical and immunohistochemical stains assist in the diagnosis of metastatic tumors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Metastases to the optic nerve may produce edema of the optic nerve head, decreased vision, and visual field defects. Because metastases may involve the parenchyma or the optic nerve sheath, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography may be valuable in detecting the presence of additional lesions and identifying their location.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Metastases to the retina, which are very rare, appear as white, noncohesive lesions, often distributed in a perivascular location suggestive of cotton-&#173;wool spots (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;20-9</span>). Because of secondary vitreous seeding of tumor cells, these metastases sometimes resemble retinitis more than they do a true tumor. Vitreous aspirates for cytologic studies may confirm the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Other diagnostic factors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">One of the most important diagnostic factors in the evaluation of suspected metastatic tumors is a history of systemic malignancy. More than 90% of patients with uveal metastasis from carcinoma of the breast, for example, have a history of treatment prior to the development of ocular involvement. In the remaining 10% of patients, the primary tumor can usually be diagnosed by breast examination at the time the suspicious ocular lesion is detected. For other patients, however, often there is no prior history of malignancy. This is especially true of patients with ocular metastasis from the lung. A complete systemic evaluation, a family history, and a history of smoking may alert the ophthalmologist to the suspected site of an occult primary tumor. Any patient with an amelanotic fundus mass suspected of being a metastatic focus should undergo a thorough systemic evaluation, including imaging of the breast, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Prognosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diagnosis of tumor metastatic to the uvea implies a poor prognosis, because widespread dissemination of the primary tumor has usually occurred. In one report, the survival time following the diagnosis of metastasis to the uvea ranged from 1 to 67&#160;months, depending on the primary cancer type. Metastatic carcinoid is associated with long survival times. Historically, patients with breast carcinoma metastatic to the uvea survived an average of 9–13&#160;months after the metastasis was recognized, but the number of patients who survive for many years after initial diagnosis is increasing. Shorter survival time is typically seen in patients with lung carcinoma or carcinomas arising from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The goal in ophthalmic management of ocular metastases is preservation or restoration of vision and palliation of pain. Radical surgical procedures and treatments with risks greater than the desired benefits should be avoided.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Indications for treatment include decreased vision, pain, diplopia, and severe ocular prop&#173;tosis. The patient’s age and health status and the condition of the fellow eye are also critical in the decision-&#173;making process. The treatment modality in patients with metastatic ocular disease should be individually tailored. When ocular metastases are concurrent with widespread metastatic disease, systemic chemotherapy alone or in combination with local therapy is reasonable. In patients manifesting metastases in the eye alone, local therapy modalities may be sufficient, allowing conservation of visual function with minimal systemic morbidity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for sensitive tumors (eg, breast cancer) may induce a prompt response. In such patients, no additional ocular treatment may be indicated. However, when vision is endangered by choroidal metastases in spite of chemotherapy, additional modalities of local therapy, such as external-&#173;beam radiation, brachytherapy, photodynamic therapy, or transpupillary thermotherapy, may be necessary. Radiotherapy is frequently associated with rapid improvement of the patient’s symptoms, along with resolution of exudative retinal detachment and, often, direct reduction in tumor size. Possible adverse effects of the radiation include cataract, radiation retinopathy, and radiation optic neuropathy. In rare cases, enucleation is performed because of severe, unrelenting pain.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Direct Intraocular Extension</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Direct extension of extraocular tumors into the eye is rare; the sclera is usually an effective barrier against intraocular invasion. Intraocular extension occurs most commonly with conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma and less frequently with conjunctival melanoma and basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid. Only a small minority of carcinomas of the conjunctiva penetrate the globe, and these are often variants of squamous cell carcinoma: mucoepidermoid carcinoma or spindle cell variant. These more aggressive neoplasms usually recur several times after local excision before they invade the eye.</p>

			<p class="h1">Lymphomatous Tumors</p>
				<div id="Chapt20_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intraocular lymphomas may arise in different parts of the eye, expressing various clinical manifestations. <span class="italic">Primary intraocular lymphoma</span> (also known as <span class="italic">large cell lymphoma,</span> <span class="italic">vitreoretinal lymphoma,</span> or <span class="italic">retinal lymphoma</span>) is the most common and most aggressive type of lymphoma involving the eye and is often associated with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). In these cases, the vitreous and retina are involved. Less frequently, the eye is involved in <span class="italic">systemic lymphoma (also called visceral or nodal lymphoma).</span> In systemic lymphoma, the uveal tract is more commonly involved, usually in a pattern of metastatic disease. In advanced cases, the intraocular findings of the 2&#160;types may overlap. In recent decades, the incidence of PCNSL has increased significantly in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Primary Intraocular Lymphoma</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Clinical evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular signs and symptoms may occur before CNS&#160;findings. In such cases, the disease may masquerade as a nonspecific uveitis. The onset of bilateral posterior uveitis in patients older than 50&#160;years is suggestive of large cell lymphoma, as is “chronic” uveitis in patients in their fifth to seventh decade. Although 30% of patients present with unilateral involvement, delayed involvement of the second eye occurs in approximately 85% of patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diffuse vitreous cells may be associated with deep subretinal and/or sub-RPE yellow-&#173;white infiltrates (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;20-10</span>). Often, fine details of the retina are obscured by the density of the vitritis (“headlight in the fog”). Retinal vasculitis and/or vascular occlusion may be observed. The RPE may reveal characteristic clumping overlying the sub-RPE infiltrates (see Fig 10-14 and the discussion of histologic findings in Chapter&#160;10). Anterior chamber reaction may be minimal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Photographic and fluorescein angiographic studies document baseline clinical findings but are rarely helpful in defining a differential diagnosis. Ultrasonographic examination may reveal discrete nodular or placoid infiltration of the subretinal space, associated retinal detachment, and vitreous syneresis with increased reflectivity. Clinical history and neurologic evaluation reveal neurologic deficits in up to 10% of patients, and 60% of patients show concomitant CNS&#160;involvement at the time of presentation. If the diagnosis is suspected, neurologic consultation coupled with CT or MRI studies and lumbar puncture should be coordinated with diagnostic vitrectomy.</p>
			<p class="h3">Pathologic studies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diagnostic confirmation of ocular involvement requires sampling of the vitreous and, when appropriate, the subretinal space. Coordinated presurgical planning with the ophthalmic pathologist regarding sample handling is critical. The ophthalmic pathologist should be skilled in the handling of small-&#173;volume intraocular specimens and experienced in the evaluation of vitreous samples.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The best approach to pathologic evaluation of the specimen remains controversial. Diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy is indicated to obtain an undiluted vitreous specimen. If a subretinal nodule is accessible in a region of the retina unlikely to compromise visual function, subretinal aspiration of the lesion can be performed. A single vitrectomy biopsy may not be adequate; a second biopsy may be required. Evaluation of the vitreous and subretinal specimen may be performed using cytopathology (see Chapter&#160;10, Fig&#160;10-15), including immunohistochemical studies for subclassification of the cells, flow cytometry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for gene rearrangements and the ratio of interleukin-10 (IL-10) to IL-6 (see Chapters&#160;3, 4, and&#160;10).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Preferably, a pathologist familiar with the diagnosis of intraocular large cell lymphoma evaluates the specimen. If an adequate specimen is obtained, multiple pathologic approaches may be employed. Cytologic evaluation is essential in establishing the diagnosis; with flow cytometry, PCR, and cytokine levels (ratio of IL-10 to IL-6) serving as ancillary studies. Specimens that reveal malignant lymphocytic cells establish the diagnosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;20-11</span>), and evaluation of cell surface markers may allow for subclassification of the tumor.</p>
			<p class="h3">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Because the blood–ocular barriers may limit penetration of chemotherapeutic agents into the eye, irradiation of the affected eye using fractionated external-&#173;beam radiation has remained popular in some centers for treatment of intraocular lymphoma. However, although radiotherapy may induce ocular remission, the tumor can recur, and further irradiation places the patient at risk for vision loss caused by radiation retinopathy. Radiotherapy to the eye is often given with systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy. Some centers use systemic chemotherapy alone, mainly high-dose methotrexate, for the treatment of vitreoretinal lymphoma. However, studies have shown that drug penetration into the retina and vitreous is limited with systemic administration, and recurrence is common. Because of concern about the disadvantages of ocular irradiation and systemic chemotherapy, centers use intraocular chemotherapy, injecting methotrexate or rituximab into the vitreous, with very good responses and low ocular recurrence rates. Parallel to the treatment of the intraocular disease, the CNS&#160;and/or systemic lymphoma should be treated by a medical oncologist.</p>
			<p class="h3">Prognosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The prognosis for patients with large cell lymphoma is poor, but advances in early diagnosis have produced a cohort of long-term survivors. Serial follow-&#173;up with consultative management by an experienced medical oncologist is critical in the management of this disease. Patients with PCNSL should be observed carefully by an ophthalmologist for possible ocular involvement, even after remission of the CNS&#160;disease.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Uveal Lymphoproliferative Lesions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many cases of uveal lymphoid infiltration, formerly known as <span class="italic">reactive lymphoid hyperplasia,</span> are now recognized as low-grade lymphomas. These lesions, which typically pre&#173;sent in patients in the sixth decade of life, can occur at any uveal site. Similar lymphoid proliferation can occur in the conjunctiva and orbit (see also Chapter&#160;5 for conjunctival involvement, Chapter&#160;12 for uveal involvement, and Chapter&#160;14 for orbital involvement).</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients typically notice painless, progressive vision loss. Ophthalmoscopically, a diffuse or, in rare cases, nodular amelanotic thickening of the choroid is noted. On CT/MRI or ocular echography imaging, an adjacent episcleral component may be seen. Exudative retinal detachment and secondary glaucoma may be present in up to 85% of eyes. Frequently, delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnostic intervention is significant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This rare disorder is characterized pathologically by localized or diffuse infiltration of the uveal tract by lymphoid cells. The etiology is unknown. Clinically, this condition can simulate posterior uveal melanoma, metastatic carcinoma to the uvea, sympathetic ophthalmia, Vogt-Koyanagi-&#173;Harada syndrome, and posterior scleritis. Proptosis of the affected eye may occur in up to 15% of patients who develop simultaneous orbital infiltration with benign lymphoid cells. Ultrasonographic testing reveals a diffuse, homogeneous choroidal infiltrate with associated secondary retinal detachment. Extraocular extension or orbital involvement may be best detected with ultrasonography.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Pathologic studies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Biopsy confirmation should be targeted to the most accessible tissue. If extraocular involvement is present, biopsy of the involved conjunctiva or orbit may be considered. Fine-&#173;needle aspiration biopsy or pars plana vitrectomy with biopsy may be indicated for isolated uveal involvement. Coordination with the ophthalmic pathologist is crucial, as it increases the likelihood of confirmation with appropriate cell marker studies.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Historically, eyes with this type of lymphoid infiltration were generally managed by enucleation due to presumed malignancy. Current management emphasizes globe-&#173;conserving therapy aimed at vision preservation. Early intervention with low-dose ocular and orbital fractionated external-&#173;beam radiotherapy may definitively manage the disease.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Prognosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The prognosis for survival is excellent for patients with uveal lymphoid infiltration, with the rare exception of patients with systemic lymphoma. Preservation of visual function appears related to primary tumor location and secondary sequelae, including exudative retinal detachment or glaucoma. Early intervention appears to enhance the likelihood of vision preservation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Secondary Involvement of Systemic Lymphoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular lymphoma may represent secondary spread from systemic disease.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Clinical evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Secondary ocular involvement of systemic lymphoma has a variable presentation. Features may include uveitis, infiltration of any portion of the uveal tract, or a discrete mass of the conjunctiva, eyelid, or orbit. Diagnostic biopsy is directed to the most accessible region of the eye where a large amount of tissue can be accessed.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment is dictated by the type of lymphoma and extent of disease. Therapy may include systemic chemotherapy, orbital radiation, or bone marrow transplantation. Such cases are best managed in coordination with a medical oncologist.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Ocular Manifestations of Leukemia</p>
				<div id="Chapt20_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular manifestations of leukemia are common, occurring in as many as 80% of the eyes of patients examined at autopsy. Clinical studies have documented ophthalmic findings in as many as 40% of patients at diagnosis. Patients may be asymptomatic, or they may report blurred or decreased vision. Clinically, the retina is the most commonly affected intraocular structure. Leukemic retinopathy is characterized by intraretinal and subhyaloid hemorrhages, hard exudates, cotton-&#173;wool spots, and white-&#173;centered retinal hemorrhages (pseudo–Roth spots)—all of which are usually the result of associated anemia, hyperviscosity, and/or thrombocytopenia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;20-12</span>). True leukemic infiltrates are less common and appear as yellow deposits in the retina and the subretinal space. Perivascular leukemic infiltrates produce gray-white streaks in the retina. Vitreous involvement by leukemia is rare and most often results from direct extension via retinal hemorrhage. If necessary, a diagnostic vitrectomy can be performed to establish a diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although clinically, the retina is the most commonly affected ocular structure, histologic studies have shown that the uvea is more commonly affected than the retina. The uveal tract may serve as a “sanctuary site,” predisposing the eye to be the structure in which recurrent disease first manifests clinically. Choroidal infiltrates may be difficult to detect with indirect ophthalmoscopy; they may be better detected on ultrasonography as diffuse thickening of the choroid. Serous retinal detachments may overlie these infiltrates. Leukemic involvement of the iris manifests as a diffuse thickening with loss of the iris crypts, and, in some cases, small nodules may be seen at the margin of the pupil. Leukemic cells may invade the anterior chamber, forming a pseudohypopyon. Infiltration of the angle by these cells can give rise to secondary glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A patient with leukemic infiltration of the optic nerve (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;20-13</span>) may present with severe vision loss and optic nerve edema. One or both eyes may be affected. This is an ophthalmic emergency and requires immediate treatment to preserve as much vision as possible. Systemic and CNS assessment including lumbar puncture with cytology is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Systemic and intrathecal combination chemotherapy is needed, with or without radiation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Leukemic infiltrates may also involve the orbital soft tissue, with resultant proptosis. These tumors, which are more common with myelogenous leukemias, are referred to as <span class="italic">granulocytic sarcomas</span> or <span class="italic">chloromas.</span> They have a predilection for the lateral and medial walls of the orbit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of leukemic involvement of the eye generally consists of low-dose radiation therapy to the eye and systemic chemotherapy. The prognosis for vision depends on the type of leukemia and the extent of ocular involvement.</p>
