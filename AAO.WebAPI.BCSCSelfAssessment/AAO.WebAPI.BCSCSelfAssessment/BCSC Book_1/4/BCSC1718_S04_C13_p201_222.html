			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The eyelids extend from the eyebrow superiorly to the cheek inferiorly and can be subdivided into orbital and tarsal components. At the level of the tarsus, the eyelid consists of 4&#160;main histologic layers, from anterior to posterior:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">skin</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">orbicularis oculi muscle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">tarsus</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">palpebral conjunctiva</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">A surgical plane of dissection may be made through an incision along an isolated section of pretarsal orbicularis muscle (Riolan muscle), indicated by the gray line of the eyelid margin. This functionally divides the eyelid into anterior and posterior lamellae (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-1</span>). See also BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The skin of the eyelids is thinner than that of most other body sites. It consists of an epidermis of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, which contains melanocytes and antigen-&#173;presenting Langerhans cells, and a dermis of loose collagenous connective tissue, which contains the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">cilia and associated sebaceous glands (of Zeis)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">apocrine sweat glands (of Moll)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">eccrine sweat glands</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">pilosebaceous units</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Eyelid glands secrete their products in various ways. Apocrine sweat glands secrete sweat by decapitating the apical part of the cell. Eccrine and lacrimal glands secrete sweat without losing any part of the cell. Sebaceous glands are holocrine glands, meaning they lose the entire cell as they secrete.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Two muscles elevate the eyelid: the <span class="italic">levator palpebrae superioris</span> (a skeletal muscle), of which only the aponeurotic portion is present in the eyelid, and the <span class="italic">Müller muscle</span> (a smooth muscle). The <span class="italic">orbicularis oculi</span> (a striated skeletal muscle) closes the eyelid. The <span class="italic">tarsal plate,</span> a thick plaque of dense, fibrous connective tissue, contains the sebaceous meibomian glands. Also present near the upper border of the superior tarsal plate (and less so along the lower border of the inferior tarsal plate) are the accessory lacrimal glands of Wolfring; the accessory lacrimal glands of Krause are located in the conjunctival fornices. The <span class="italic">palpebral conjunctiva</span> adheres tightly to the posterior surface of the tarsus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following are some common dermatopathological terms that also relate to ophthalmology:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2"><span class="italic">acanthosis:</span> increased thickness (hyperplasia) of the stratum malpighii (consisting of the strata basale and spinosum) of the epidermis</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">hyperkeratosis:</span> increased thickness of the stratum corneum of the epidermis</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">parakeratosis:</span> retention of nuclei within the stratum corneum</li>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Congenital Anomalies</p>
				<div id="Chapt13_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For additional discussion of the congenital anomalies listed in this chapter, see BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Distichiasis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Distichiasis is the aberrant formation of cilia within the tarsus that causes them to exit the eyelid margin through the orifices of the meibomian glands. The pathogenesis of distichiasis is thought to be an anomalous formation within the tarsus of a complete pilosebaceous unit rather than the normal sebaceous (meibomian) gland. Histologically, hair follicles can be seen within the tarsal plate. The tarsus may be rudimentary, and the glands of Moll are often hypertrophic. See BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> and Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for additional discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Phakomatous Choristoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A rare congenital tumor, phakomatous choristoma (Zimmerman tumor), is formed from the aberrant location of lens epithelium within the inferonasal portion of the lower eyelid. These cells may undergo cytoplasmic enlargement, identical to the “bladder” cell in a cataractous lens. Basement membrane material that exhibits positive periodic acid–Schiff staining is produced, recapitulating the lens capsule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-2</span>). The nodule formed is usually present at birth and enlarges slowly. Complete excision is the usual treatment.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Congenital Dermoid Cyst</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital dermoid cysts are not uncommon in the lateral brow of the eyelid. However, they are more traditionally regarded as orbital lesions and are therefore discussed in Chapter&#160;14 of this volume.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Inflammations</p>
				<div id="Chapt13_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Infectious</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Depending on the causative agent, eyelid infections may produce disease that is localized (eg, hordeolum), multicentric (eg, papillomas), or diffuse (eg, cellulitis). Routes of infection include primary inoculation through a bite or wound, direct spread from a contiguous site such as a paranasal sinus infection, or hematogenous dissemination from a remote site. Infectious agents may be</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">bacterial, such as <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> in hordeolum and infectious blepharitis</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">viral, such as poxvirus in molluscum contagiosum</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-4">fungal, such as blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, or aspergillosis</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Hordeolum</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Also known as a <span class="italic">stye,</span> hordeolum is a primary, acute, self-&#173;limited inflammatory process typically involving the glands of Zeis and, less often, the meibomian glands. A small abscess, or focal collection of neutrophils and necrotic debris (ie, pus), forms at the site of infection. Lesions may drain spontaneously or require surgical drainage.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Cellulitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diffuse spread of acute inflammatory cells through tissue planes is known as <span class="italic">cellulitis. Preseptal cellulitis</span> involves the tissues of the eyelid anterior to the orbital septum, which is the fibrous membrane that connects the borders of the tarsal plates to the bony orbital rim. Cellulitis is most often secondary to bacterial infection of the paranasal sinuses. Histologic examination reveals neutrophilic infiltration of the soft tissues, accompanied by interstitial edema and, occasionally, necrosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-3</span>). See BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> for further information.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Viral infections</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Human papillomavirus may infect the skin of the eyelids, typically manifesting as <span class="italic">verruca vulgaris,</span> commonly known as a <span class="italic">wart.</span> Clinically, it is usually an elevated papillary lesion. Histologically, the lesions exhibit a papillary growth pattern and demonstrate hyperkeratosis and acanthosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-4A</span>). Infected cells may demonstrate cytoplasmic clearing (koilocytosis) (Fig&#160;13-4B). A mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate is typically present in the superficial dermis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In <span class="italic">molluscum contagiosum,</span> which is caused by a member of the poxvirus family, dome-shaped, waxy epidermal nodules with central umbilication form. If present on the eyelid margin, the nodules may cause a secondary follicular conjunctivitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-5</span>). Histologically, the lesions are distinctive; they are described in the legend for <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;13-6</span>.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Noninfectious</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Chalazion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A chalazion is a chronic, often painless nodule of the eyelid that develops when the lipid secretions of the meibomian glands or, less often, the glands of Zeis are discharged into the surrounding tissues, inciting a lipogranulomatous reaction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-7</span>).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Degenerations</p>
				<div id="Chapt13_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Xanthelasma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Xanthelasma consists of single or multiple soft yellow plaques occurring in the medial canthal region of the eyelids. Associated hyperlipoproteinemic states, particularly hyperlipoproteinemia types&#160;II and III, are present in 30%–40% of patients with xanthelasma. These eyelid xanthomas consist of collections of histiocytes with foamy, lipid-&#173;laden cytoplasm distributed diffusely and often around blood vessels within the dermis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-8</span>). Associated inflammation is minimal.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Amyloidosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">amyloid</span> refers to a heterogeneous group of extracellular proteins that exhibit birefringence and dichroism under polarized light when stained with Congo red (see Chapter&#160;5 and Fig&#160;5-13). These features result from the 3-dimensional configuration of the proteins into a <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-pleated sheet. Proteins that may form amyloid deposits include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">immunoglobulin light chain fragments (AL amyloid) in plasma cell dyscrasias</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">transthyretin mutations in familial amyloid polyneuropathy types&#160;I and&#160;II</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">gelsolin mutations in familial amyloidosis—Finnish type, also known as gelsolin amyloidosis or Meretoja syndrome</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Amyloid deposits in the skin are usually multiple, bilateral, symmetric, waxy yellow-&#173;white nodules. The deposition of amyloid within blood vessel walls in the skin causes increased vascular fragility and often results in intradermal hemorrhages, accounting for the purpura seen clinically (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-9</span>). On routine histologic sections, amyloid appears as an amorphous, eosinophilic extracellular deposit. Stains useful in demonstrating amyloid deposits include Congo red, crystal violet, and thioflavin&#160;T (see Figure&#160;10-12). Electron microscopy reveals that the deposits are composed of randomly oriented extracellular fibrils measuring 7–10&#160;nm in diameter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Amyloid deposits within the skin of the eyelid are highly indicative of a systemic disease process, either primary or secondary, whereas deposits elsewhere in the ocular adnexa are more likely to represent a localized disease process. Other systemic diseases with eyelid manifestations are listed in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;13-1</span>.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Cysts</p>
				<div id="Chapt13_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Epidermoid Cysts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epidermoid cysts, also known as <span class="italic">epidermal inclusion cysts,</span> are common in the eyelids. They may arise spontaneously or as a result of the entrapment of epidermis beneath the skin surface following surgery or trauma. Epidermoid cysts are lined with keratinized stratified squamous epithelium and contain keratin (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-10</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Ductal Cysts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The eyelid contains the ducts of numerous structures, including the lacrimal gland and the apocrine and eccrine sweat glands. Cysts may develop in any of these ducts. Ducts are typically lined with a double layer of cuboidal epithelium, as are ductal cysts. The lumen of the cyst typically appears empty histologically. A cyst arising from the duct of the lacrimal gland is called <span class="italic">dacryops.</span> Cysts arising from sweat ducts are referred to as either <span class="italic">apocrine</span> or <span class="italic">eccrine hidrocystomas</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-11</span>).</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-12">Neoplasia</p>
				<div id="Chapt13_Top6">
			<p class="h2-h1">Epidermal Neoplasms</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Seborrheic keratosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Seborrheic keratosis, a common benign epithelial proliferation, typically occurs in middle age. Clinically, it is a well-&#173;circumscribed, oval, dome-shaped to verrucoid “stuck-on” papule, varying from pink to dark brown in color. Histologically, although several architectural patterns are possible, all of them demonstrate hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and some degree of papillomatosis. The acanthosis is a result of the proliferation of either polygonal or basaloid squamous cells without dysplasia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pseudohorn cysts, which are concentrically laminated collections of surface keratin within the acanthotic epithelium, are a characteristic finding in most types of seborrheic keratosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-12</span>). Irritated seborrheic keratosis, also termed <span class="italic">inverted follicular keratosis,</span> shows nonkeratinized squamous epithelial whorling, or squamous “eddies,” instead of pseudohorn cysts (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-13</span>). Sudden onset of multiple seborrheic keratoses is known as the <span class="italic">Leser-&#173;Trélat sign</span> and is associated with malignancy, usually a gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma; these keratoses may in fact represent evolving acanthosis nigricans. <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;13-2</span> lists other systemic malignant tumors with cutaneous manifestations.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Keratoacanthoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Keratoacanthoma is a rapidly growing epithelial proliferation with a potential for spontaneous involution. Strong evidence supports the idea that keratoacanthomas are a variant of a well-&#173;differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. These dome-shaped nodules, which have keratin-&#173;filled central craters, may attain a considerable size, up to 2.5&#160;cm in diameter, within a matter of weeks to months (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-14</span>). The natural history is typically spontaneous involution over several months, resulting in a slightly depressed scar.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, keratoacanthomas show a cup-shaped invagination of well-&#173;differentiated squamous cells that form irregularly configured nests and strands and incite a chronic inflammatory host response. The proliferating epithelial cells undermine the adjacent normal epidermis. At the deep aspect of the proliferating nodules, mitotic activity and nuclear atypia may occur, making it difficult to differentiate between keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Many dermatopathologists and ophthalmic pathologists prefer to call this lesion <span class="italic">well-&#173;differentiated squamous cell carcinoma</span> because of the possibility of perineural invasion and metastasis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If treated surgically, the lesion should be completely excised to permit optimal histologic examination of the lateral and deep margins of the tumor–host interface.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Actinic keratosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Actinic keratoses are precancerous squamous lesions that appear, clinically in middle age, as erythematous, scaly macules or papules on sun-&#173;exposed skin, particularly on the face and the dorsal surfaces of the hands. Actinic keratoses range from a few millimeters to 1&#160;cm. Hyperkeratotic types of these lesions may form a cutaneous horn, and hyperpigmented types may clinically simulate lentigo maligna. Squamous cell carcinoma may develop from preexisting actinic keratosis. However, when squamous cell carcinoma arises in actinic keratosis, the risk of subsequent metastatic dissemination is very low (0.5%–3.0%).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, there are 5&#160;subtypes, which range from hypertrophic to atrophic. All types demonstrate changes in the epidermis with hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis. Cellular atypia (nuclear hyperchromasia and pleomorphism and an increased nuclear-to-&#173;cytoplasmic ratio) is present and ranges from mild (involving only the basal epithelial layers) to frank carcinoma in situ (full-&#173;thickness involvement of the epidermis). Dyskeratosis (premature individual cell keratinization) and mitotic figures above the basal epithelial layer are often found (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-15</span>). The underlying dermis shows solar elastosis (elastotic degeneration of collagen) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-16</span>), which manifests as fragmentation, clumping, and loss of eosinophilia of dermal collagen. A chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate is usually seen in the superficial dermis. Histologic examination of the base of the lesion is necessary to determine whether stromal invasion indicative of squamous cell carcinoma is present.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Carcinoma</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Basal cell carcinoma</span> Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common malignant neoplasm of the eyelids, accounts for more than 90% of all malignant eyelid tumors. Although exposure to sunlight is the main risk factor, genetic factors can play a role in familial syndromes. The lower eyelid is more commonly involved than the upper eyelid, with the medial canthus being the second most common site of involvement. Tumors in the medial canthal area are more likely to be deeply invasive and to involve the orbit. Nodular BCC (the most common type) is a slow-&#173;growing, slightly elevated lesion with ulceration and pearly, raised, rolled edges (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-17</span>). The morpheaform, or sclerosing, variant of BCC is a flat or slightly depressed, pale yellow, indurated plaque; this type is often infiltrative, and its extent is difficult to determine clinically. A small percentage of BCCs are pigmented or multicentric.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As the name implies, BCCs originate from the stratum basale, or stratum germinativum, of the epidermis and the outer root sheath of the hair follicle and occur only in hair-&#173;bearing tissue. Tumor cells are characterized by relatively bland, monomorphous nuclei and a high nuclear-to-&#173;cytoplasmic ratio. BCC forms cohesive islands with nuclear palisading of the peripheral cell layer. BCCs may exhibit a variety of histologic patterns, including keratotic (hair follicle), squamous (metatypical), sebaceous, adenoid, and eccrine (syringoid) differentiation. In the morphea (sclerosing) variant, thin cords and strands of tumor cells are set in a fibrotic stroma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-18</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The treatment of choice is complete excision, and surgical margin control is required. Typically, margin control is achieved with frozen sections or Mohs micrographic surgery. Morbidity in BCCs is almost always the result of local spread; metastasis is extremely unusual.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Squamous cell carcinoma</span> Although <span class="italic">squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)</span> may occur in the eyelids, it is far less common than BCC. Like BCCs, most SCCs arise in solar-&#173;damaged skin, so the lower eyelid is more frequently involved than the upper. However, SCC is more likely to involve the upper eyelid than is BCC. The clinical appearance of SCC is diverse, ranging from ulcers to plaques to fungating or nodular growths. Accordingly, the clinical differential diagnosis is long; an accurate diagnosis requires pathologic examination of excised tissue.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologic examination shows atypical squamous cells that form nests and strands, extend beyond the epidermal basement membrane, infiltrate the dermis, and incite a fibrotic tissue reaction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-19</span>). Tumor cells may be well differentiated (forming keratin and easily recognizable as squamous), moderately differentiated, or poorly differentiated (requiring ancillary studies to confirm the nature of the neoplasm). When the diagnosis is in question, the pathologist should look for the presence of intercellular bridges between tumor cells. Perineural and lymphatic invasion may be present and should be reported when identified microscopically. To treat this tumor adequately, frozen section (conventional or Mohs micrographic surgery) or permanent section margin control is required. Regional lymph node metastasis may occur in patients with SCC of the eyelid.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Dermal Neoplasms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Capillary hemangiomas</span> are common in the eyelids of children. They usually appear at or shortly after birth as a bright red lesion, grow over weeks to months, and involute by school age. Intervention is reserved for lesions that affect vision because of ptosis or astigmatism, promoting amblyopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The histologic appearance depends on the stage of evolution of the hemangioma. Early lesions may be very cellular, with solid nests of plump endothelial cells and correspondingly little vascular luminal formation. Established lesions typically show well-&#173;developed, flattened, endothelium-&#173;lined capillary channels in a lobular configuration (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-20</span>). Involuting lesions demonstrate increased fibrosis and hyalinization of capillary walls with luminal occlusion.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Neoplasms and Proliferations of the Dermal Appendages</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Syringoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Syringoma, a common benign lesion of the lower eyelid, typically manifests as multiple, tiny, flesh-&#173;colored papules. Syringomas result from a malformation of the eccrine sweat gland ducts. Histologically, syringomas consist of multiple comma-&#173;shaped or round ductules lined with a double layer of epithelium and containing a central lumen, often with secretory material (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-21</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Sebaceous hyperplasia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sebaceous hyperplasia is an uncommon benign lesion of the eyelid and face. Clinically, it appears as a small, yellow papule. Histologically, it is typically a single enlarged sebaceous gland with numerous lobules attached to a single central duct (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-22</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Sebaceous adenoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sebaceous adenoma is a rare benign lesion of the eyelid that typically manifests as a yellow, circumscribed nodule. Histologically, it is composed of multiple sebaceous lobules that are irregularly shaped and incompletely differentiated (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-23</span>). The possibility of Muir-&#173;Torre syndrome should be considered when sebaceous adenoma is diagnosed (see Table&#160;13-2).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Sebaceous carcinoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sebaceous carcinoma most commonly involves the upper eyelid of elderly persons. It may originate in the meibomian glands of the tarsus, the glands of Zeis in the skin of the eyelid, or the sebaceous glands of the caruncle. Clinically, the diagnosis is often missed or delayed because of this lesion’s propensity to mimic a chalazion or chronic unilateral blepharoconjunctivitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-24</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, well-&#173;differentiated sebaceous carcinomas are readily identified by the microvesicular foamy nature of the tumor cell cytoplasm (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-25A</span>). Moderately differentiated tumors may show some sebaceous features. Poorly differentiated tumors, however, may be difficult to distinguish from other, more common malignant epithelial tumors. Special stains, such as oil red&#160;O or Sudan black&#160;B, can be used to diagnose sebaceous carcinomas, because they reveal lipid within the cytoplasm of tumor cells. Tissue staining for lipids should be performed on frozen or cryostat sections, because the lipid constituents are often removed during paraffin processing. When sebaceous carcinoma is suspected clinically, the pathologist should be alerted so that tissue handling allows for any special stains needed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A primary characteristic of sebaceous carcinoma is <span class="italic">pagetoid spread,</span> the dissemination of both individual tumor cells and clusters of tumor cells within the epidermis or conjunctival epithelium (Fig&#160;13-25B). Another characteristic is the complete replacement of conjunctival epithelium by tumor cells, or <span class="italic">sebaceous carcinoma in situ</span> (Fig&#160;13-25C). A rare variant of sebaceous carcinoma involves only the epidermis and conjunctiva without demonstrable invasive tumor.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment recommendations include wide local excision of nodular lesions. Large or deeply invasive tumors may require exenteration. Because it can be difficult to identify intraepithelial spread, permanent margins are often more reliable than frozen section control of surgical margins or Mohs micrographic surgery. Preoperative mapping via routine processing of multiple biopsies may afford a more accurate assessment of the extent of spread of the carcinoma. Survival rates for sebaceous carcinoma are worse than those for SCC, but they have improved in recent years as a result of increased awareness, earlier detection, more accurate diagnosis, and more appropriate treatment. Metastases first involve regional lymph nodes; sentinel lymph node biopsy can therefore be helpful in tumor staging.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Melanocytic Neoplasms</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Melanocytic nevus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Melanocytic nevi are benign proliferations of melanocytes that commonly occur on the eyelids. Melanocytic nevi may be visible at birth or shortly after birth (congenital nevi) or become apparent in adolescence or adulthood; congenital nevi tend to be larger than those appearing in later years. Nevi greater than 20&#160;cm in diameter are called <span class="italic">giant congenital melanocytic nevi.</span> The risk for development of melanoma in congenital nevi is proportional to the size of the nevus; close follow-&#173;up and/or excision of congenital nevi is warranted. Congenital nevi of the eyelid may develop in utero before the separation of the upper and lower eyelids, resulting in a “kissing” nevus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-26</span>). Nevi in adults often appear as dome-shaped lesions on the eyelid margin. Other forms of rare nevi can occur on the eyelid, including blue nevi, Spitz nevi, and dysplastic nevi.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, most nevi are composed of nevus cells, specialized melanocytes that have a round rather than dendritic shape and tend to cluster together in nests. The cytoplasm of the nevus cell contains a variable amount of melanosomes. Other characteristics of these cells include growth within and around adnexal structures, vessel walls, and the perineurium and extension into the deep reticular dermis or subcutaneous tissue. When a combination of round and spindle-&#173;shaped cells is seen in a lesion, the term <span class="italic">combined nevus</span> is used.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nevi typically begin as macular (flat) lesions and evolve with age. When histologic examination reveals nests of melanocytes along the dermal–epidermal junction, these lesions are termed <span class="italic">junctional nevi</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-27</span>). Clinically, a junctional nevus is indistinguishable from an ephelis, or freckle, but in the latter, the basal layer of epidermal cells contains the pigment. Typically in adolescence, the junctional nests of nevus cells begin to migrate into the superficial dermis, and the nevus becomes increasingly elevated. At this stage, the nevus may also increase in pigmentation. When both junctional and intradermal components are present, the histologic classification becomes <span class="italic">compound nevus</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-28</span>). Finally, sometime in adulthood, the junctional component disappears, leaving only nevus cells within the dermis, and the classification accordingly becomes <span class="italic">intradermal or dermal nevus</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-29</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cytomorphology of the nevus cells also evolves: the cells in the superficial portion of the nevus are polygonal, or epithelioid, in shape (type&#160;A nevus cells). Within the midportion, the cells become smaller, have less cytoplasm, and resemble lymphocytes (type&#160;B nevus cells). At the deepest levels, the nevus cells appear similar to Schwann cells of peripheral nerves with a spindle configuration (type&#160;C nevus cells). Recognition of this “maturation” is useful for classifying melanocytic neoplasms as benign. Multinucleated giant melanocytes and interspersed adipose tissue are common in older nevi.</p>
			<p class="h3">Melanoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cutaneous melanoma occurs rarely on the eyelids. It may be associated with a preexisting nevus, develop de novo, or extend from a tumor elsewhere on the face. Clinical features that suggest malignancy are the same as those for dysplastic nevi; in addition, melanoma is heralded by a vertical (perpendicular to the skin surface) growth phase. There are 3&#160;main histologic subtypes of melanoma that occur on the eyelids (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-30</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">lentigo maligna</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">superficial spreading</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">nodular</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Lentigo maligna melanoma,</span> which develops on the face of elderly individuals, has a long preinvasive phase and is the most common type occurring on the eyelids. <span class="italic">Superficial spreading melanoma</span> is the most common type of cutaneous melanoma; it demonstrates a radial (intraepidermal) growth pattern that extends beyond the invasive component. <span class="italic">Nodular melanoma</span> has a significant vertical growth phase that results in a raised or indurated mass.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The characteristic histologic features of melanoma include pagetoid intraepidermal spread of atypical melanocytic nests and single cells, nuclear abnormalities (as previously listed), lack of maturation in the deeper portions of the mass, and atypical mitotic figures. A bandlike lymphocytic host response along the base of the mass is more common in melanoma than in benign proliferations. Prognosis is correlated with tumor thickness (Breslow thickness) in stage&#160;I (localized) disease. Metastases, when they occur, typically involve regional lymph nodes first.</p>

The invasive component is seen as brown cells (spindle and epithelioid) in the superficial dermis. <span class="figure-caption-bold">B,</span>&#160;In superficial spreading melanoma, tumor cell nests are present in all levels of the epidermis, often in a pagetoid fashion, with cells or clusters of cells scattered among epithelial cells.
