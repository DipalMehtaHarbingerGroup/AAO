			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intraocular tumors make up a broad spectrum of benign and malignant lesions that can lead to loss of vision and/or loss of life. Effective management of these lesions depends on accurate diagnosis. In most cases, experienced ophthalmologists diagnose intraocular neoplasms via clinical examination and ancillary diagnostic tests.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the past 3&#160;decades, significant advances have been made in managing intraocular tumors and understanding their biology. The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) gathered important information concerning the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults, choroidal melanoma. The COMS&#160;incorporated both randomized clinical trials for patients with medium and large choroidal melanomas and an observational study for patients with small choroidal melanomas. The COMS&#160;reported outcomes for enucleation versus brachytherapy for the treatment of medium-&#173;sized tumors and for enucleation alone versus pre-&#173;enucleation external-&#173;beam radiotherapy for large melanomas. In addition to the study’s primary objectives, the COMS&#160;provided data regarding local tumor failure rates and visual acuity outcomes after iodine-125 brachytherapy, which conserves the globe. The results confirmed that conservative management for well-&#173;selected patients does not alter melanoma-&#173;related morbidity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In recent years, there have been several other advances in the management of choroidal melanoma. Researchers have identified key cytogenetic aberrations, specifically monosomy&#160;3 and isochromosome arm 8p, that are associated with metastatic disease. Fine-&#173;needle aspiration biopsy (discussed in greater detail in Chapter&#160;4) is available for tumor prognostication and identification of patients at high risk for distant metastasis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The predisposing gene for retinoblastoma, which is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in children, has been isolated, cloned, and sequenced. As with choroidal melanoma, treatment of retinoblastoma has transitioned toward globe-&#173;conserving therapy, primarily systemic and focal chemotherapy. The trend away from external-&#173;beam radiotherapy and toward chemotherapy has been fueled by growing recognition of the former’s potential risk for increasing the incidence of secondary malignancies in children who harbor a germline mutation of the retinoblastoma gene. Advances in the understanding of the molecular genetics of retinoblastoma continue to enhance clinicians’ ability to screen and counsel families with this ocular malignancy (see Chapter&#160;19).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The majority of malignancies in the United States and Europe are staged using the classification system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). <br />The AJCC system stages cancer in patients based on tumor size, lymph node status, and distant metastasis. Clinical and pathological data may be used to clinically stage a tumor. It is an important distinction that patients (not a single organ such as the eye) are staged. Other systems are used to group eyes for particular diagnoses, such as retinoblastoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any ophthalmic pathology may result in vision loss, and the appropriate patient education and referral to vision rehabilitation should be provided early, before loss of independence and function occur. The SmartSight patient handout on the American Academy of Ophthalmology website (www.aao.org/smart-sight-low-vision) provides tips on making the most of remaining vision and outlines how patients can identify vision rehabilitation resources in their community.</p>
