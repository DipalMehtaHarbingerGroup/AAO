			<p class="chapter-title">Retinoblastoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor of childhood and is the second most common (after uveal melanoma) primary intraocular malignant tumor in all age groups. The frequency of retinoblastoma ranges from 1 in 14,000 to <br />1 in 20,000&#160;live births. It is estimated that 250–300&#160;new cases occur in the United States each year. Both sexes and all races are equally affected, and the tumor occurs bilaterally in 30%–40% of cases. Approximately 90% of cases are diagnosed in patients younger than 3&#160;years. The mean age at diagnosis depends on family history and the laterality of the disease:</p>

				<li class="bullet-list-last">patients with unilateral disease: 24&#160;months</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="h1">Genetic Counseling</p>
			<div id="Chapt19_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In nearly all cases, retinoblastoma is caused by a mutation in the <span class="italic">RB1</span> tumor suppressor gene located on the long arm of chromosome&#160;13 at locus&#160;14 (13q14). In order for a tumor to form, both copies of the <span class="italic">RB1</span> gene must be mutated. If a patient has bilateral retinoblastoma, there is an approximately 98% chance that it represents a germline mutation. About 10% of retinoblastoma patients have a family history of retinoblastoma. The children of a patient who has the hereditary form of retinoblastoma have a 45% chance of being affected (50% chance of inheriting and 90% chance of penetrance). In these cases, the child inherits an abnormal gene from the affected parent, which, when coupled with somatic mutations in the remaining normal <span class="italic">RB1</span> allele, leads to the development of multiple tumors in 1 or both eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sporadic cases constitute approximately 90% of all retinoblastomas. Of these, 60% of patients have unilateral disease with no germline mutations. The remaining patients have new germline mutations and multiple tumors will develop. Approximately 15% of the sporadic unilateral patients are carriers of a germline <span class="italic">RB1</span> mutation. Unless there are multiple tumors in the affected eye, these patients cannot be distinguished from those without a germline mutation. Much like their counterparts with bilateral retinoblastoma, children with unilateral retinoblastoma and a germline mutation are more likely to present at an earlier age. Commercial laboratories are able to test retinoblastoma patients’ blood for germline mutations. Methods of genetic testing used in retinoblastoma screening include gene sequencing via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), multiplex ligation-&#173;dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis. With these screening methods, there is a 96% chance of finding a new tumor mutation, if one exists. The success rate can be further increased if blood and freshly harvested tumor are available for analysis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Between 1% and 3% of retinoblastomas in children younger than 6&#160;months are associated with a mutation in <span class="italic">N-MYC</span> (not <span class="italic">RB1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Counseling with a genetic specialist is recommended for all families afflicted with or a risk for developing retinoblastoma. Genetic counseling for retinoblastoma can be very complex (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-1</span>). As mentioned earlier, a bilateral retinoblastoma survivor has a 45% chance of having an affected child, whereas a unilateral survivor has a 7%–15% chance of having an affected child. Unaffected parents of a child with bilateral involvement have less than a 5% risk of having another child with retinoblastoma. If 2 or more siblings are affected, the chance that another child will be affected increases to 45%.

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Diagnostic Evaluation</p>
				<div id="Chapt19_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retinoblastoma is a clinical diagnosis. Fine-&#173;needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) should be undertaken only with extreme caution and only by an experienced ocular oncologist, because of the risk of systemic dissemination of tumor.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Clinical Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The presenting signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma are determined by the extent and location of the tumor at the time of diagnosis. In the United States, the most common presenting signs of retinoblastoma are leukocoria (white pupillary reflex), strabismus, and ocular inflammation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-2</span>, <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;19-1</span>). Other presenting features, such as iris heterochromia, spontaneous hyphema, and orbital cellulitis or inflammation, are uncommon. In rare instances, a small lesion may be found on routine examination. Reported vision problems are infrequent because most patients are preschool-&#173;aged children.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of retinoblastoma can generally be made on the basis of an office examination that includes documented visual acuity. An examination under anesthesia (EUA) is needed for all patients suspected of having retinoblastoma in order to completely assess the extent of ocular disease prior to treatment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-3</span>). The intraocular pressure and corneal diameter of both eyes should be measured intraoperatively. The location of all tumors in each eye should be clearly documented.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retinoblastoma begins as a translucent, gray to white intraretinal tumor, fed and drained by dilated, tortuous retinal vessels (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;19-4, 19-5</span>). As the tumor grows, foci of calcification develop, giving the tumor its characteristic chalky white appearance. Exophytic tumors grow beneath the retina and may have an associated serous retinal detachment. As these tumors grow, the retinal detachment may become extensive, obscuring visualization of the tumor (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-6</span>). Endophytic tumors grow on the retinal surface into the vitreous cavity. Blood vessels may be difficult to discern in endophytic tumors. Endophytic tumors are more likely to give rise to <span class="italic">vitreous seeds</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-7</span>), which are cells shed from retinoblastoma that remain viable in the vitreous and subretinal space and may eventually result in tumor implants throughout the eye. Vitreous seeds may also enter the anterior chamber, where they can aggregate on the iris to form nodules or settle inferiorly to form a pseudohypopyon (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-8</span>). Secondary glaucoma and rubeosis iridis occur in approximately 50% of such cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Diffuse infiltrating retinoblastoma</span> is a rare variant of retinoblastoma that is detected later in childhood (&gt;5&#160;years); it is typically unilateral. Diffuse infiltrating retinoblastoma presents a diagnostic dilemma, as the retina may be difficult to see through the dense vitreous cells. This variant is often mistaken for an intermediate uveitis of unknown etiology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ultrasonography can aid the diagnosis of retinoblastoma by demonstrating characteristic calcifications within the tumor. Although these calcifications can also be seen on computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the preferred diagnostic modality for evaluating the optic nerve, orbits, and brain. MRI not only offers better soft-&#173;tissue resolution but also avoids exposing the patient to potentially harmful radiation. Recent studies have suggested that systemic metastatic evaluation, typically via bone marrow and lumbar puncture, is not indicated in children without neurologic abnormalities or evidence of extraocular extension. If optic nerve extension is suspected, lumbar puncture may be performed. Parents and siblings should be examined for evidence of untreated retinoblastoma or retinocytoma, which would represent evidence of a hereditary predisposition to the disease. Children with retinoblastoma should have a complete history and physical examination done by a pediatric oncologist.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the United States, patients rarely present with metastases or intracranial extension at the time of diagnosis. The most frequently identified sites of metastatic involvement in children with retinoblastoma include abdominal viscera, brain, distal bones, lymph nodes, skull bones, and spinal cord. Retinoblastoma cells may escape the eye by invading the optic nerve and extending into the subarachnoid space. In addition, tumor cells may massively invade the choroid before traversing emissary canals or eroding through the sclera to enter the orbit. Extraocular extension may result in proptosis as the tumor grows in the orbit (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-9</span>). In the anterior chamber, tumor cells may invade the trabecular meshwork, gaining access to the conjunctival lymphatics. Subsequently, palpable preauricular and cervical lymph nodes may develop.</p>
			<p class="h2">Differential Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several lesions simulate retinoblastoma (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;19-2</span>). Most of these conditions can be differentiated from retinoblastoma on the basis of a comprehensive history, clinical examination, and results from appropriate ancillary diagnostic testing.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Persistent fetal vasculature</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV), also known as <span class="italic">persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV),</span> is typically recognized within days or weeks of birth. The condition is unilateral in two-thirds of cases and is associated with microphthalmos, a shallow or flat anterior chamber, a hypoplastic iris with prominent vessels, and a retrolenticular fibrovascular mass that draws the ciliary body processes inward. On indirect ophthalmoscopy, a vascular stalk may be seen arising from the optic nerve head and attaching to the posterior lens capsule. Ultrasonography confirms the diagnosis by showing persistent hyaloid remnants arising from the optic nerve head, usually in association with a closed funnel retinal detachment. No retinal tumors are seen, and the axial length of the eye is shortened. Calcification may be present. See also Chapter&#160;10 and BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span></p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Coats disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Coats disease is clinically evident within the first decade of life and is more common in boys. The lesion is typically characterized by unilateral retinal telangiectasia associated with intraretinal yellow exudation without a distinct mass (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-10</span>). The progressive leakage of fluid may result in extensive retinal detachment and neovascular glaucoma. Ultrasonography documents the absence of retinal tumors and shows the collection of cholesterol in the subretinal fluid. Fluorescein angiography shows classic telangiectatic vessels and areas of retinal ischemia (see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Ocular toxocariasis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular toxocariasis typically occurs in older children who have a history of soil ingestion or exposure to puppies or kittens. Toxocariasis presents with posterior and peripheral granulomas, with associated uveitis. Exudative retinal detachment, organized vitreoretinal traction, and cataracts may be present. Ultrasonography shows vitritis, retinal detachment, granulomas, retinal traction, and the absence of calcium. See BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for additional discussion.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Astrocytoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retinal astrocytoma, or astrocytic hamartoma, generally appears as a small, smooth, white, glistening tumor located in the nerve fiber layer of the retina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-11</span>). It may be single or multiple, unilateral or bilateral. In some cases, it may grow and calcify, typically having a mulberry appearance. Astrocytomas occasionally arise from the optic nerve head; such tumors are often referred to as <span class="italic">giant drusen.</span> Retinal astrocytomas commonly occur in patients with tuberous sclerosis and may also be found in patients with neurofibromatosis; most are not associated with a phakomatosis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Medulloepithelioma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Medulloepithelioma is a tumor derived from the inner layer of the optic cup (medullary epithelium); it can be either benign or malignant (see Chapter&#160;11, Fig&#160;11-48). This type of tumor typically becomes clinically evident in children aged 4–12&#160;years, but it may also occur in adults. It usually appears as a variably pigmented mass arising from the ciliary body (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-12A</span>), but it has also been documented in the retina and optic nerve. Smaller lesions may present with unexplained neovascular glaucoma accompanied by iris heterochromia. The tumor may erode through the iris root or grow along the&#160;lens zonular fibers, entering the anterior chamber. Diagnostic imaging may reveal large cysts on the surface of the tumor or within the lesion (Fig&#160;19-12B). See Chapter&#160;11 for a discussion of the histologic features of medulloepithelioma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Management of medulloepithelioma usually consists of enucleation or observation. Small lesions have been successfully treated with plaque brachytherapy, but most eyes treated in this fashion succumb to enucleation. For most of these tumors, surgical resection is specifically avoided because of late complications and documented metastases associated with this treatment. Fortunately, metastasis is rare with appropriate management, even if the tumor appears frankly malignant on histologic examination.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Classification</p>
				<div id="Chapt19_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Reese-&#173;Ellsworth Classification for Intraocular Tumors is the historic method of grouping intraocular retinoblastomas. The system takes into account the number, size, and location of tumors and the presence or absence of vitreous seeding. This classification sorts eye tumors into groups from very favorable (group&#160;I) to very unfavorable (group&#160;V) by probability of eye preservation when treated with external-&#173;beam radiation alone. The Reese-&#173;Ellsworth classification does not stage extraocular disease, nor does it provide prognostic information about patient survival or vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The use of external-&#173;beam radiotherapy for the treatment of retinoblastoma has been supplanted by the use of primary local and/or systemic chemotherapy. As a result, the International Classification System for Intraocular Retinoblastoma is now the most commonly used system worldwide. In this system, eyes are grouped on the basis of the size of the tumor and the presence of subretinal fluid, as well as the extent of vitreous and subretinal seeding. Eyes are assigned a letter from A to E (most to least salvageable with chemotherapy). Eyes with anterior chamber involvement, neovascular glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, and/or necrosis are generally considered unsalvageable (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;19-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) also has a staging system for retinoblastoma that relates to both intraocular and extraocular disease, but it is not used clinically by most ocular oncologists.</p>

			<p class="h1">Associated Conditions</p>
				<div id="Chapt19_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Retinocytoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retinocytoma is clinically indistinguishable from retinoblastoma. Chapter&#160;11 describes the histologic characteristics that distinguish retinocytoma from retinoblastoma (see Fig&#160;11-47). The developmental biology of retinocytoma is controversial; some authorities believe that retinocytoma is retinoblastoma that has undergone differentiation, analogous to ganglioneuroma, the differentiated form of neuroblastoma. Other authorities contend that retinocytoma is a benign counterpart of retinoblastoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although histologically benign, retinocytoma carries the same genetic implications as retinoblastoma. A child harboring a retinoblastoma in 1&#160;eye and a retinocytoma in the other should be considered capable of transmitting an <span class="italic">RB1</span> mutation to offspring.</p>
			<p class="reference-single ParaOverride-7">Singh AD, Santos MM, Shields CL, Shields JA, Eagle RC, Jr. Observations on 17&#160;patients with retinocytoma. <span class="italic">Arch Ophthalmol.</span> 2000;118(2):199–205.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET),</span> or <span class="italic">trilateral retinoblastoma,</span> is reserved for cases of bilateral retinoblastoma associated with ectopic intracranial disease. The ectopic focus is usually located in the pineal gland or the parasellar region and has historically been known as a <span class="italic">pinealoblastoma.</span> This tumor affects up to 5% of children with a germline <span class="italic">RB1</span> mutation. In rare cases, a child may present with ectopic intracranial retinoblastoma prior to ocular involvement. More commonly, this independent malignancy presents months to years after treatment of the intraocular retinoblastoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several observations support the concept of primary intracranial pinealoblastoma. CT findings helped establish that intracranial tumors in some patients with terminal retinoblastoma are anatomically separate from the primary tumors in the orbit. These intracranial tumors are not associated with metastatic disease elsewhere in the body, and unlike metastatic retinoblastoma, they often demonstrate features of differentiation such as <span class="italic">Flexner-&#173;Wintersteiner rosettes</span> (see Chapter&#160;11, Fig&#160;11-43). Embryologic, immunologic, and phylogenic evidence of photoreceptor differentiation in the pineal gland offers further support for the concept of trilateral retinoblastoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All patients with retinoblastoma should undergo baseline neuroimaging studies to exclude intracranial involvement. Experts disagree on the role of serial imaging in screening for PNETs. Reports suggest a decline in their incidence; whether this is due to the prophylactic effect of systemic chemotherapy or a decrease in the use of radiation therapy is unclear.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Treatment</p>
				<div id="Chapt19_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When treating retinoblastoma, the ophthalmologist must understand that it is a malignancy. In industrialized countries, survival rates exceed 95% when the disease is contained within the eye. However, with extraocular spread, survival rates decrease to below 50%. Therefore, when determining the treatment strategy, the clinician’s first goal must be preservation of life, then preservation of the eye, and finally preservation of vision. Modern management of intraocular retinoblastoma incorporates a combination of different treatment modalities, including enucleation, local and systemic chemotherapy, laser therapy, cryotherapy, external-&#173;beam radiation therapy, and plaque brachytherapy. Metastatic disease is managed using intensive chemotherapy, radiation, and bone marrow transplantation. Treating children with retinoblastoma requires a team composed of an ocular oncologist, pediatric ophthalmologist, pediatric oncologist, and radiation oncologist.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Enucleation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Enucleation remains the definitive treatment for retinoblastoma, providing, in most cases, a complete surgical resection of the disease. Typically, enucleation is considered an appropriate intervention when</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-9">the tumor involves more than 50% of the globe</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">orbital or optic nerve involvement is suspected</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">anterior segment involvement is present</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">neovascular glaucoma is present</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-10">the affected eye has limited vision potential</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The goal of enucleation techniques is to minimize the potential for inadvertent globe penetration while obtaining the greatest possible length of resected optic nerve, typically longer than 10&#160;mm. Most surgeons use porous integrated implants, such as hydroxyapatite or porous polyethylene.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Attempts at globe-&#173;conserving therapy should be undertaken only by ophthalmologists well versed in the management of this rare childhood tumor and in conjunction with similarly experienced pediatric oncologists. Failed attempts at eye salvage may place a child at risk of metastatic disease.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Chemotherapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Over the past 30&#160;years, systemic intravenous chemotherapy has replaced primary external-&#173;beam radiation as the preferred globe-&#173;salvaging method. Most treatment regimens include various combinations of carboplatin, vincristine, and etoposide and are most successful in curing eyes belonging to group&#160;A, B, or&#160;C. After initial regression, tumors are consolidated with laser therapy, cryotherapy, or brachytherapy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-13</span>) (see the following sections for discussion of these treatments). Due in part to concerns associated with systemic chemotherapy (such as second tumors and ototoxicity), local methods such as intra-&#173;arterial and intravitreal chemotherapy have gained acceptance in many centers. Intra-&#173;arterial chemotherapy involves selective cannulation of the ophthalmic artery and direct injection of chemotherapy to the ocular vasculature (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;19-14</span>). Various drugs have been used for this purpose, most commonly melphalan. Studies suggest that this drug is highly effective for subretinal seeds. Direct intravitreal injection of agents such as melphalan is gaining acceptance for the management of persistent or recurrent vitreous seeds. Given the potential for significant complications associated with local therapy, these approaches should be used only by clinicians well trained in the management of retinoblastoma to avoid potential extraocular extension.</p>
			<p class="h2">Laser Therapy Including Transpupillary Thermotherapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Various lasers have been employed to treat retinoblastoma; most experts use the 810-nm infrared diode laser. Lasers can either be used as a primary modality or serve as an adjuvant therapy after systemic or local chemotherapy.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Cryotherapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cryotherapy is an effective treatment for tumors with an apical thickness of up to 3&#160;mm. It is applied under direct visualization with a triple freeze–thaw technique. Typically, laser photoablation is chosen for posteriorly located tumors and cryoablation for more anteriorly located tumors. Repetitive tumor treatments are often required for both techniques, in addition to close monitoring for tumor growth or treatment complications.</p>
			<p class="h2">External-Beam Radiation Therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Because retinoblastoma tumors are responsive to radiation, external-&#173;beam radiation has become a salvage technique, used only when chemotherapy has failed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Two major concerns have limited the application of external-&#173;beam radiotherapy using standard techniques:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-8">&#9;1.&#9;the association between germline mutations of the <span class="italic">RB1</span> gene and a lifelong increase in the risk of second, independent primary malignancies (eg, osteosarcoma) that is exacerbated by exposure to external-&#173;beam radiotherapy</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-1">&#9;2.&#9;the potential for radiation-&#173;related sequelae, which include midface hypoplasia, radiation-&#173;induced cataract, and radiation optic neuropathy and retinopathy</p>
			<p class="h2">Plaque Radiotherapy (Brachytherapy)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Radioactive plaque therapy may be used both as a salvage therapy for eyes in which globe-&#173;conserving therapies have failed to destroy all viable tumor and as a primary treatment for eyes with relatively small to medium-&#173;sized tumors. This technique is generally applicable for tumors less than 16&#160;mm in basal diameter and 8&#160;mm in apical thickness. The most commonly used isotopes are iodine-125 and ruthenium-106. Intraoperative localization with ultrasound enhances local tumor control for plaque brachytherapy. When compared with external-&#173;beam radiotherapy, this radiotherapy modality may be associated with a greater likelihood of radiation optic neuropathy or retinopathy. Limiting the radiation dose to periocular structures may lower the incidence of radiation-&#173;induced second malignancies.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Prospective Trials</p>
				<div id="Chapt19_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) has begun a series of international, multicenter prospective trials to improve the outcomes and clarify the toxicities associated with the modern treatment of retinoblastoma. These studies are assessing various aspects of care, including the role of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in high-risk histopathology, treatment of extraocular retinoblastoma with intensive chemotherapy, and the efficacy of intra-&#173;arterial chemotherapy in unilateral group&#160;D disease.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Spontaneous Regression</p>
				<div id="Chapt19_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In rare instances, retinoblastoma can undergo complete and spontaneous necrosis (although this is seldom recognized with active disease). Spontaneous regression is recognized clinically after involutional changes such as phthisis have occurred. The incidence of spontaneous regression is unknown. Although the mechanism by which spontaneous regression occurs is not understood, its histologic appearance is diagnostic. The vitreous cavities of these phthisical eyes are filled with islands of calcified cells embedded in a mass of fibroconnective tissue. Close inspection of the peripheral portion of these calcified islands reveals the ghosted contours of fossilized tumor cells.

				<div id="Chapt19_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Children with intraocular retinoblastoma who have access to modern medical care have a very good prognosis for survival; survival rates are greater than 95% for children in industrialized countries. The most important risk factor associated with death is extraocular extension of tumor, either directly through the sclera or, more commonly, by invasion of the optic nerve, especially to the surgically resected margin (see Chapter&#160;11, Fig&#160;11-45). The impact of choroidal invasion on survival rates is unclear. Although a multivariate analysis of a large case series showed that choroidal invasion is not predictive of metastases, the significance of this pathologic finding remains controversial and is still under investigation. Some evidence suggests, however, that bilateral tumors may increase the risk of death because of their association with primary intracranial tumors (see the section Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor in this chapter).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Children who survive bilateral retinoblastoma have an increased incidence of nonocular malignancies later in life. The mean latency for second tumor development is approximately 9&#160;years from management of the primary retinoblastoma. The <span class="italic">RB1</span> mutation is associated with an approximately 25% incidence of second tumor development within 50&#160;years in patients treated without exposure to radiation therapy. External-&#173;beam radiation therapy decreases the latency period, in turn increasing both the incidence of second tumors in the first 30&#160;years of life and the proportion of tumors in the head and neck. The most common type of second cancer in these patients is osteogenic sarcoma. Other relatively common second malignancies include pinealoblastomas, brain tumors, cutaneous melanomas, soft-&#173;tissue sarcomas, and primitive unclassifiable tumors (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;19-4</span>). Estimates suggest that up to 20% of patients who have bilateral retinoblastoma will present with an apparently unrelated neoplasm within 20&#160;years and that up to 40% will present with a third malignancy within 30&#160;years. The prognosis for survival in patients with retinoblastoma who later present with sarcomas is lower than 50%.</p>
