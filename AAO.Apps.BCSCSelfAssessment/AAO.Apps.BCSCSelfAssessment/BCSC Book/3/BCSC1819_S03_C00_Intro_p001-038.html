			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Introduction </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="CharOverride-1">optics</span> refers to the properties and manipulation of light. In this part of the &#173;Quick-&#173;Start Guide, we introduce the basic ideas of optics—sufficient to understand the essence of clinical refraction, as presented in Part 2, “How to Refract.” Readers already familiar with this material are welcome to turn immediately to Part 2. </p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">The Tale of the Camera Obscura </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="CharOverride-1">camera obscura</span> (Latin for “dark chamber”) was introduced in the 17th century to describe the use (already known to the ancients) of a small &#173;light-&#173;tight room or box fitted with a small hole on 1 side. The hole allowed the inverted image of a bright scene or bright object to be projected onto the opposite wall or side of the box, where it might be conveniently viewed or studied. The earliest known drawing of such a device is shown in <span class="xref-figure">Figure I-1</span>, where it is being used to view a solar eclipse.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Experience with such devices leads to 3 important observations:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-5">1.&#9;The projected image is inverted.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;The “depth of field” of the projected image is superb: objects are simultaneously in focus at all distances, from foreground objects to distant hills and even astronomical objects (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-6">3.&#9;The image is very dim.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The inverted image clearly arises from the &#173;straight-&#173;line propagation of light rays originating from each point in the original object, with the pinhole acting like a sort of fulcrum (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The great depth of field is due to the small aperture, which allows light rays from each object to reach only a very small region in the image plane. </p>
			<p class="body-text">Of course, the small aperture also greatly limits the amount of light that is available to form the image, which explains why it is so dim. </p>
			<p class="body-text">To obtain a brighter image, suitable for the activation of a detector (such as a photographic plate, a CCD chip, or the retina), it is necessary to enlarge the pinhole aperture to admit more light. Unfortunately, enlarging the aperture also allows the rays of light emanating from each point of the source object to form a cone of light, which illuminates a proportionally larger disc on the image plane. These “blur circles” (or perhaps more generally, “blur ellipses”) smear out the image, resulting in substantial blurring (<span class="xref-figure">Figures&#160;I-4</span>, <span class="xref-figure">I-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">To recover a sharp image while retaining the image intensity afforded by a larger aperture, it is necessary to recombine the light rays that originate from each point of the source object so that they will converge on a single image point. This can be accomplished by placing a suitable lens in the aperture (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-6</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, the strategy of using a lens to recover the sharpness of images by enlarging the aperture necessarily sacrifices the depth of field obtained with the simple pinhole. Though the lens will simultaneously bring to focus rays of light from different points in the source object, it can do so only for source points at the same distance from the lens (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-7</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">These observations about image formation in simple cameras essentially summarize the entire challenge of basic optics: to form sharp images from beams of light defined by apertures of finite size to provide sufficient brightness for the application at hand. The rules for the proper selection of lenses for this purpose are discussed in the next section.</p>
			<p class="h1">Convex Lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Consider a thin (spherical) convex lens intended to form an image of an object at “optical infinity”—that is, very far away (say, a star)—located to the left of the lens. The image will be formed to the right of the lens—say, at a distance <span class="CharOverride-1">f,</span> measured in meters. This distance is referred to as the <span class="CharOverride-1">focal length</span> of the lens. The <span class="CharOverride-1">power</span> of the lens is then <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> = 1/<span class="CharOverride-1">f</span><span class="CharOverride-1">,</span> where the unit for <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> is reciprocal meters, which is referred to as the “diopter” (abbreviated “D”). For example, a lens that images starlight 0.5 m to its right has a power of <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> = 1/0.5 m = 2.0 D (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Combining Lenses </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If 2 (thin) lenses—say, of powers <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span><span class="CharOverride-3">1</span> and <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span><span class="CharOverride-3">2</span>—are placed in contact immediately adjacent to one another, and we consider them together as a single compound lens system, the power of the 2 lenses taken together is given, to an excellent approximation, by the sum of the powers of the constituent lenses: <span class="CharOverride-1">P = P</span><span class="CharOverride-3">1</span><span class="CharOverride-1"> + P</span><span class="CharOverride-3">2</span>. This summation is the utility of the reciprocal description of lens power.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Imaging Nearby Objects: Vergence and the Vergence Equation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If the source object is located only a finite distance to the left of a convex lens, but at greater distance than the focal length, <span class="CharOverride-1">f,</span> the image will be farther to the right of the lens than the image of an object that is infinitely far away, such as a star. The distance from the source object to the lens is referred to as the <span class="CharOverride-1">object distance</span>; the distance from the lens to the image is known as the <span class="CharOverride-1">image distance</span>. Assuming both the source object and the image are in air, the formula for locating the image is </p>
			<p class="equation-single ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-1">U</span> +<span class="CharOverride-1"> P</span> = <span class="CharOverride-1">V</span> </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">where <span class="CharOverride-1">U </span>= 1/<span class="CharOverride-1">u</span> is the <span class="CharOverride-1">vergence</span> of the object at a distance <span class="CharOverride-1">u</span> to the left of the lens, <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> is the power of the lens, and <span class="CharOverride-1">V </span>= 1/<span class="CharOverride-1">v</span> is the vergence of the light emerging from the lens to form the image at distance<span class="CharOverride-1"> v</span> to the right of the lens (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-9</span>). Note: In this <span class="CharOverride-1">vergence equation</span>, distances to the LEFT of the lens are treated as <span class="CharOverride-1">negative numbers</span> (so, in this situation,<span class="CharOverride-1"> u</span>&#160;&lt; &#160;0). The vergence<span class="CharOverride-1">, U </span>= 1/<span class="CharOverride-1">u</span>, of an object to the left of a lens is likewise a <span class="CharOverride-1">negative number</span>. Distances to the RIGHT of a lens, and thus, in this case, the image vergence <span class="CharOverride-1">V = 1/v</span>, are considered <span class="CharOverride-1">positive</span>. In this context, it is important to keep track of the <span class="CharOverride-1">sign</span> of the power of a convex lens as a <span class="CharOverride-1">positive number</span> as well. Objects infinitely far from the lens generate beams of light that reach the lens with a vergence of <span class="CharOverride-1">V = </span>1<span class="CharOverride-1">/∞ = </span>0<span class="CharOverride-1">.</span></p>

			<p class="h1">Concave Lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Concave lenses do not by themselves form images, but they can be used to shift an image away (to the right) from an existing lens or lens system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A (spherical) concave lens will cause light from an infinitely distant object to diverge. If these divergent rays are extended back toward the light source (eg, to the left of the lens for a source object to the left), they will intersect at a “virtual” focal point—say, at a distance <span class="CharOverride-1">f</span> to the left of the lens (<span class="xref-figure">Figure 1-10</span>). In keeping with the sign conventions above, the power of this lens is given by <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> = 1/<span class="CharOverride-1">f</span> (with <span class="CharOverride-1">f</span> in meters). Here, <span class="CharOverride-1">f</span> is a <span class="CharOverride-1">negative</span> number, and the power of the concave lens is likewise a <span class="CharOverride-1">negative</span> number. </p>
			<p class="body-text">Concave lenses can be combined with other immediately adjacent lenses. The power of such a lens system follows the same simple addition formula that we introduced for convex lenses:</p>
			<p class="equation-single ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> = <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span><span class="CharOverride-3">1</span> + <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span><span class="CharOverride-3">2</span></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">where, now, we must track the algebraic signs carefully. </p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-11"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-5" src="BCSC1819_S03_C00_Intro_p001-038-web-resources/image/5.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Summary Thus Far </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Starting with an object a finite distance to the left of a convex lens that is strong enough to form an image to the right of the lens (that is, with a focal length <span class="CharOverride-1">f</span> shorter than the object distance), there are 2 ways to move the image to the left (closer to the lens): by moving the object to the LEFT or by adding an additional convex lens to the lens system. Similarly, there are 2 ways to move the image to the right (farther from the lens): by moving the object to the RIGHT (so long as it remains farther from the lens than the focal length) or by adding a concave lens to the system. </p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-12">Images in Denser Media </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If the light leaving a lens travels in a medium in which the speed of light is less than its speed in air, such as a watery tissue like the aqueous or vitreous humor of the eye, we must modify the image vergence term in the vergence equation. Here</p>
			<p class="equation-single"><span class="CharOverride-1">V</span> = η/<span class="CharOverride-1">v</span> </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">where η is the <span class="CharOverride-1">refractive index</span> of the denser medium: the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (or air—they are nearly the same) to the speed of light in the “denser” medium. The refractive index is always a number greater than 1.00, as light travels more slowly in dense media than in air. For the watery tissues in the eye, the value η = 1.33 is a useful approximation. (This casual use of the term “denser” has nothing to do with the specific gravity of the medium!)</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-13"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" src="BCSC1819_S03_C00_Intro_p001-038-web-resources/image/6.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">A Very Much Simplified Model Eye</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">We now have in hand the tools to illustrate the correction of simple axial refractive errors, which arise from a mismatch between the optical power of the anterior segment (cornea and crystalline lens) and the axial length of the eye.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Emmetropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Suppose that all the refracting power of the eye is concentrated at a single plane, at the apex of the cornea, and assume the typical axial length of 24.0 mm. If this &#173;ultra-&#173;simplified model eye is to focus light from distant objects on the retina (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-11A</span>)—the power at the corneal apex must be given by the vergence equation: 0 + P = 1.33/0.024 m = 55.42 D. [The actual total nominal power of the human eye is in fact about 60 D, so our simplistic model is off by only about 10%.]</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Myopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Now suppose that our eye has the standard anterior segment with optical power 55.42 D but is 1.0 mm longer than normal—so the axial length is 25.0 mm. In such an eye, which is said to be <span class="CharOverride-1">myopic</span>, light from a distant point source comes to a focus where the retina “should have been” (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-11B</span>); then the rays cross and continue for another millimeter before they form an (annoying) &#173;blur-&#173;circle on the retina. To correct the refractive error, we must shift the image location 1.0 mm toward the back of the eye. This can be done, say, with a concave (diverging, “minus” power) contact lens of power <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> placed adjacent to the corneal apex according to the vergence equation: 0 + (<span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> + 55.42 D) = 1.33/.025 D = +53.20 D. Thus, the power of the required contact lens is <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> = 53.20 D – 55.42 D = –2.22&#160;D. [In a more precise calculation, the correction would be about –3 D for each millimeter of excess axial length.]</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Hyperopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Similarly, if the axial length of our &#173;ultra-&#173;simplified model eye were reduced by 1.0 mm, distant objects would form an image behind the retina (Figure I-11C). Such an eye is <span class="CharOverride-1">hyperopic</span>. The required contact lens power would be given by the vergence equation: 0 + (<span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> + 55.42&#160;D] = 1.33/0.023 m = +57.83 D, or <span class="CharOverride-1">P</span> = +57.83 D – 55.42 D = +2.41 D, a convex “plus” lens.</p>

			<p class="h1">Astigmatism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition to the axial refractive errors discussed previously, it is necessary to deal with refracting surfaces that lack circular symmetry, which allows spherical lenses to focus all the light emerging from a point source in a single image point. Consider a “toroidal” surface, such as the side of a rugby ball, an (American) football, or the outer rim of automobile tire inner tube (a torus), as in <span class="xref-figure">Figure I-13</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To envision the effect of such a refracting surface, called a <span class="CharOverride-1">toric lens</span>, consider the curvature of the intersection of the surface with a plane that rotates about the line perpendicular to the surface at the apex (the “normal” line; see <span class="xref-figure">Figure I-14</span>). The orientation of such a plane, or the intersection curve itself, is referred to as a <span class="CharOverride-1">meridian</span> of the lens. </p>
			<p class="body-text">As this normal plane rotates, the curvature of the intersection varies, from a flattest meridian to a steepest meridian, 90° away (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-15</span>). </p>
			<p class="body-text">Light rays from a distant point source that land on the steepest meridian are refracted as if they encountered a spherical lens of the same curvature. Light rays that land on the flattest meridian are refracted as if they encountered a spherical lens with less dioptric power. Thus, the focal length varies with the choice of meridian, and the toroidal surface does not image the light from a single point source at a single image point. This situation is referred to as <span class="CharOverride-1">astigmatism</span>, from the Latin for “absence” of a (single) point, or focus (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-16</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The flattest and steepest meridians lie 90° apart from each other; they are known as <span class="CharOverride-1">principal meridians</span>. We can keep track of this situation by drawing a <span class="CharOverride-1">power cross</span>, which shows the orientation of the steepest and flattest meridians, and indicates their respective refractive powers (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-17</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In practice, it is often convenient to emphasize the <span class="CharOverride-1">difference</span> in the refractive powers of the principal meridians. In this case, we can interpret the refracting surface as the combination of a spherical refracting surface, which refracts equally in all directions, and a purely “cylindrical” refracting surface, with maximal power corresponding to one of the directions indicated in the power cross (and no refracting power in the orthogonal direction). Thus, for example, a lens with a power of +1.00 D horizontally and + 2.00 D vertically could be described as the combination of a spherical lens with power +1.00&#160;D and a cylindrical lens with power +1.00 D in the vertical direction.

			<p class="h1">Astigmatic Refractive Errors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Astigmatic refractive errors of the human eye are not uncommon. Corneal astigmatism is most common, but lenticular astigmatism is also found. In each case, we can consider the net refractive surface as equivalent to a spherical component with a concurrent plus&#160;&#173;cylinder astigmatic component (corresponding to the forward bulging of the cornea into the surrounding air). For example, the most common pattern of corneal astigmatism seen in younger patients, known as “with-the-rule” astigmatism, suggests a compression of the cornea by the pressure of the eyelids. This compression deforms the cornea, steepening the vertical meridian and flattening the horizontal meridian. This acts as a plus cylinder lens with axis horizontal (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-19</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The net astigmatic error is corrected by placing a cylinder of equal power and opposite sign over the eye, with the same axis as the intrinsic cylindrical error. For example, with-&#173;the-rule astigmatism can be corrected with a minus cylinder correcting lens placed with axis horizontal (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-20</span>). </p>
			<p class="body-text">Equivalently, such a refractive error can be corrected by placing a plus cylinder lens with axis vertical, and then compensating with a corresponding reduction in the power of the spherical component. </p>
			<p class="body-text">Thus, correction of an eye with an astigmatic refractive error requires the determination of <span class="CharOverride-1">3</span> quantities: the power and axis of the correcting cylindrical component, and the power of the remaining spherical component. In practice, this task is accomplished as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-15">Attempt to correct the eye with spherical lenses only, or at least to determine the optimal purely spherical correction.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Determine whether there is an astigmatic component to the refractive error.</li>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Introduction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="CharOverride-1">Clinical refraction</span> is the process of measuring the refractive status of the eyes of a patient. It is an essential tool in a great many eye examinations: refractive errors are present in nearly half of all adults and children. In most settings, “best-corrected visual acuity” is the gold standard for measuring visual performance. In this section of the &#173;Quick-&#173;Start Guide, we outline the basic technique of <span class="CharOverride-1">manifest refraction</span>—the measurement of refractive errors through patients’ subjective descriptions of how well they can see.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Do not confuse manifest refraction with the prescribing of eyeglasses. The latter is a clinical art, for which refraction is only a first step. Guidelines for prescribing glasses are presented in Chapter 4.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Manifest refraction is a subjective process. Success is based on the ability to elicit the cooperation of the patient as much as the knowledge and skill of the examiner. </p>
			<p class="body-text">The steps in the process of manifest refraction follow this sequence:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;Perform the preliminaries (check visual acuity, obtain a visual history). </p>
			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list">a.&#9;Indications for refraction: which patients should be refracted?</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;Occlude 1 eye.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;Make an initial estimate of the refractive error:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list">a.&#9;Determine the best initial estimate of the refraction, if available, from prior records, old glasses, retinoscopy, or the &#173;auto-&#173;refractor, and place it in the phoropter or trial frame. If there is any known cylindrical correction, go to step 4; if not, go to step 5.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list ParaOverride-20">&#9;OR</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list">b.&#9;If there is no prior refraction information, retinoscopy, or &#173;auto-&#173;refractor data, begin by refracting only with spherical lenses to obtain the &#173;best-&#173;possible refraction using only spheres. Go to step 3c.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-sub-lettered-list">c.&#9;Check for astigmatism by inserting a cylinder lens, adjusting the sphere to preserve the spherical equivalent, and rotating the cylinder—if this affects image clarity, you have detected some astigmatism. Leave the cylinder in the optimal position (this becomes the starting point for cross cylinder refinement—go to step 4); if rotating the cylinder has no effect on image clarity, assume there is no astigmatism. Remove the cylinder, restore the original sphere, and go directly to step 5. </p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">4.&#9;Refine the cylinder using the Jackson cross cylinder, first in the “axis position” to identify the correct cylinder axis, then in the “power position” to determine the optimal cylinder power. Preserve spherical equivalent when adjusting cylinder power by adjusting sphere power 1 click (0.25 D) in the opposite direction for every 2-click (0.50 D) change in cylinder power. Go to step 5. </p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">5.&#9;Refine the sphere power, first using a 0.50 D difference between the alternative, bracketing the previous selection, then using 0.25 D difference between the alternatives. </p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">6.&#9;Reverse the occlusion, and repeat for the fellow eye. </p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-19">7.&#9;Check for binocular balance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Additional comments, set off in boxes, are interspersed between the &#173;step-&#173;by-step instructions. Most of the &#173;step-&#173;by-step instructions that we discuss here describe refraction performed with minus cylinder equipment.

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-21">Step 1: Perform the Preliminaries</p>
			<p class="h2-h1">Check Visual Acuity </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">We use eye charts consisting of optotypes (letters or pictures) to test visual acuity. If a patient’s visual acuity is known from a prior examination, start at that line of the eye chart. Otherwise, first cover the left eye, and ask the patient to read the 20/40 line on the eye chart with the right eye (<span class="xref-figure">Figure I-21A</span>). Go up or down the eye chart to find the line your patient can just barely read. Then cover the right eye and repeat the process to measure the acuity of the left eye. </p>

Checking visual acuity well takes more time than you would imagine. Think of it as an opportunity to observe your patient’s vision, much as a neurologist carefully watches a patient walk into the exam room.

Get into this habit to minimize confusion as to which findings go with which eye. Notice systematic errors at the beginning or end of the lines of the eye chart, which might suggest a visual field defect. Craning of the neck may indicate an attempt to cheat in cases of amblyopia (“lazy eye”). “Searching” may suggest a central scotoma (blind spot). Discourage squinting!</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-21">Step 7: Accommodative Control and Binocular Balance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="CharOverride-1">Accommodation </span>is the ability of the eye to increase the focusing power of the crystalline lens, mainly to allow clear vision for near objects. In general, the primary goal of clinical refraction is to determine the refractive error, if any, with the accommodation fully relaxed. That means the eyes are focused for distant targets; the patient has the full use of the accommodative amplitude to focus over as large a range of nearer objects as possible. In addition, accommodation should be equally relaxed for the 2 eyes—a state referred to as <span class="CharOverride-1">binocular balance</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In practice, this fully relaxed state of accommodation may not occur spontaneously as patients sit for refraction, complicating the task of the refractionist. Many factors, such as hyperopic refractive errors (which can often be corrected by a patient’s own accommodative effort), awareness of near objects (including the refracting instruments and lenses), and “accommodative spasm,” may induce an increase in accommodative tone, steering the refractive process toward undercorrection of a hyperopic error or overcorrection of a myopic error. In some cases, patients seem to prefer the &#173;high-&#173;contrast, minified image seen by accommodating to compensate for a myopic overcorrection. It is thus important to make every effort to use <span class="CharOverride-1">accommodative control</span>—techniques that relax the accommodation during the refraction process and guard against inadvertent stimulation of accommodation and overminusing the patient as a result. The use of a &#173;plus lens occluder (instead of an opaque occluder), and biasing the binary comparisons to offer the &#173;more-&#173;plus choice first, will help prevent spurious accommodation. </p>

			<p class="body-text">The “Rule-1” test is a quick and easy way to check accommodative control. You can perform this test for each eye separately or binocularly if the vision is comparable in the 2 eyes:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">A.&#9;Dial in +1.00 D sphere power above the final refractive correction. Visual acuity should fall at least <span class="CharOverride-1">2</span> lines on the eye chart. (For example, if the final refraction brings the acuity to 20/20, adding +1.00 D sphere to both eyes should reduce the acuity to 20/30 or worse.)</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">B.&#9;If the acuity does not drop 2 lines as expected, continue to increase the plus sphere power until the acuity is reduced by 2 lines. </p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">C.&#9;Next, remove the excess added plus sphere power 1 click (0.25 D) at a time until the acuity returns to the optimal level. (Ask <span class="CharOverride-4">“Is this step definitely better, or are the letters just smaller and blacker?”</span>) The final endpoint should be the last step that permits the patient to read <span class="CharOverride-1">additional</span> letters. Disregard the patient’s enthusiasm for any additional minus sphere (or reduced plus sphere) power that does not allow more letters to be read.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If you perform this procedure for each eye separately, it also serves as a check of “binocular balance”—that is, assuring that the 2 eyes are accommodating to the same degree.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Lancaster &#173;red-&#173;green (“duochrome”) test is recommended for patients with 20/40 or better &#173;best-&#173;corrected acuity. It can be performed monocularly or binocularly. Performed for each eye separately, this test functions as an effective check of binocular balance:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">A.&#9;Bring up the duochrome slide or filter on your chart projector. This will display 1 side of the chart against a bright red background, and the other side against a bright green background</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">B.&#9;Ask <span class="CharOverride-4">“Which side of the chart has the clearer, crisper, blacker letters: the red side or the green side?”</span> (If the patient is confused by the intense colors, add <span class="CharOverride-4">“Concentrate on the letters, not on the backgrounds. Look at the smallest letters you can read</span><span class="CharOverride-1">.</span><span class="CharOverride-4">”</span> </p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">C.&#9;If the patient reports that the letters seen against the <span class="CharOverride-1">red</span> background are clearer, more <span class="CharOverride-1">minus</span> sphere power is needed; if the <span class="CharOverride-1">green</span> side is preferred, more <span class="CharOverride-1">plus</span> sphere power is indicated.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-28">D.&#9;When in doubt, leave the patient with the more plus (or less minus) sphere choice (ie, with a slight preference for the seeing against the red background), which will better relax the accommodation. </p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Final Remarks</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">At the core of ophthalmic practice is the ability to assess a patient’s visual function. To accomplish this, your capacity to perform an efficient, accurate refraction is critical. Subjective refraction is a clinical art—facility takes time to develop. Learn to refract well.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">There are many excuses to avoid refracting almost any patient you see. Refract every patient who needs it. Just because a refraction is not easy does not mean it is not important to the patient or that successful refraction would not greatly benefit the patient. Difficult refractions are an inevitable part of ophthalmology. If necessary, reschedule the difficult patient to allow the additional time.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Carefully adjust the pace of the refraction to the ability of the patient to respond. The patient should not feel rushed, but offer the binary comparisons crisply to encourage the patient to respond based on his or her initial visual impression. The pace should discourage the patient from attempting to accommodate before deciding on the better lens choice.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Cycloplegia (paralysis of accommodation with anticholinergic eyedrops) is indicated whenever there is uncertainty about the accommodative status. This technique should be routine for children below the age of 10 years. (See Chapter 4.)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Many healthy young adults can see 20/15 if given the chance. Don’t settle for 20/20, let alone 20/25. Children below the age of 6 or even 7 years are frequently uninterested in reading past the 20/30 line, even though more sophisticated testing methods have shown that they may possess 20/20 acuity. (That is why many “picture” eye charts stop at the 20/30 line.)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">For children under the age of 6 or 7 years, use a chart with “tumbling” E’s, Landolt Cs, or picture targets (see Figure 3-6). Do not rely on a parent’s assurance that the child knows the letters.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">There are few opportunities in clinical ophthalmology to improve your patient’s visual function as convincingly as the chance to prescribe a good pair of glasses. Competent refraction is key tool toward developing a patient’s confidence in you.</p>
