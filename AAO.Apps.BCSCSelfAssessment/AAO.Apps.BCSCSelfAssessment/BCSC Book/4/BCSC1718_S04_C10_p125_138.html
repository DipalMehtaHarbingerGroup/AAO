			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vitreous humor makes up most of the volume of the globe and is important in many diseases that affect the eye. See BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> and Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> for discussion of the anatomy of the vitreous. The strength of vitreoretinal adhesion or attachment is important in the pathogenesis of retinal tears and detachment, macular hole formation, and vitreous hemorrhage from neovascularization.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The embryologic development of the vitreous is generally divided into 3&#160;stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">primary vitreous</span> consists of fibrillar material; mesenchymal cells; and vascular components: the hyaloid artery, vasa hyaloidea propria, and tunica vasculosa lentis (see Fig&#160;4-3 in BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract</span>). The <span class="italic">secondary vitreous</span> begins to form at approximately the ninth week of gestation and is destined to become the main portion of the vitreous in the postnatal and adult eye. The primary vitreous atrophies with formation of the secondary vitreous, leaving only a clear central zone through the vitreous (called the <span class="italic">hyaloid canal,</span> or the <span class="italic">Cloquet canal</span>) and, occasionally, the Bergmeister papilla and Mittendorf dot as vestigial remnants (discussed later). The secondary vitreous is relatively acellular and completely avascular. The cells present in the secondary vitreous are called <span class="italic">hyalocytes.</span> The lens zonular fibers (also referred to as the <span class="italic">zonules of Zinn</span>) represent the <span class="italic">tertiary vitreous.</span></p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Congenital Anomalies</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Persistent Fetal Vasculature</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV; previously known as <span class="italic">persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous,</span> or <span class="italic">PHP</span><span class="italic">V</span>) is characterized by the persistence of variable components of the primary vitreous and is most often unilateral. In most cases of clinically significant PFV, a fibrovascular plaque in the retrolental space extends laterally to involve the ciliary processes, which may be pulled centripetally by traction from the fibrovascular tissue. The clinical and gross appearance of elongated ciliary processes results. The anterior fibrovascular plaque is generally contiguous posteriorly with a remnant of the hyaloid artery that may attach to the optic nerve head (also called optic disc) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-1</span>). Involvement of the posterior structures may be more extensive, with detachment of the peripapillary retina resulting from traction from preretinal membranes. The lens is often cataractous, and nonocular tissues such as adipose tissue and cartilage may be present in the retrolental mass. Eyes affected by PFV are often microphthalmic. See also Chapter&#160;19 in this volume, BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Bergmeister Papilla</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As mentioned in the earlier Topography section, the persistence of a small part of the posterior portion of the hyaloid artery is referred to as a <span class="italic">Bergmeister papilla.</span> This anomaly generally takes the form of a veil-like structure or a fingerlike projection extending anteriorly from the surface of the optic nerve head (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-2</span>). Retinal vessels may grow into a Bergmeister papilla and then return to the optic nerve head, creating prepapillary vascular loops. See Figure&#160;16-6 in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Mittendorf Dot</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The hyaloid artery attaches to the tunica vasculosa lentis just inferior and nasal to the center of the lens. With regression of these vascular structures, development of a focal lens opacity at this site, referred to as a <span class="italic">Mittendorf dot,</span> is not uncommon (see Fig&#160;2-41 in BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Vitreous Cysts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vitreous cysts generally occur in eyes with no other pathologic findings, but they have been seen in eyes with retinitis pigmentosa, those with uveitis, and eyes with remnants of the hyaloid system. Histologic studies have suggested the presence of hyaloid remnants in the vitreous cysts. The exact origin of the cysts is not known.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Inflammations</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As a relatively acellular and completely avascular structure, the vitreous is generally not a primary site for the initiation of inflammatory disorders. It does become involved secondarily in inflammatory conditions of adjacent tissues, however. The term <span class="italic">vitritis</span> is used to denote the presence of benign or malignant white blood cells in the vitreous. Vitreous inflammation associated with infectious agents, particularly bacteria and fungi, is clinically referred to as <span class="italic">infectious endophthalmitis.</span> Bacterial endophthalmitis is characterized by neutrophilic infiltration of the vitreous (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-3</span>) that leads to liquefaction of the vitreous, with subsequent posterior vitreous detachment. Severe inflammation may be accompanied by formation of fibrocellular membranes, typically in the retrolental space; these may exert traction on the peripheral retina. The vitreous infiltrate in noninfectious uveitis is typically composed of chronic inflammatory cells, including T&#160;and B&#160;lymphocytes and histiocytes (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-4</span>). See also BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span></p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Degenerations</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Syneresis and Aging</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Syneresis</span> of the vitreous is defined as liquefaction of the gel. Syneresis of the central vitreous is a nearly universal consequence of aging. It also occurs as a result of vitreous inflammation and hemorrhage and in the setting of pathologic myopia. The prominent lamellae and strands that develop in aging and following inflammation or hemorrhage are the result of abnormally aggregated collagenous vitreous fibers around syneretic areas (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-5</span>). Syneresis is one of the contributing factors leading to vitreous detachment.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Posterior Vitreous Detachment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) occurs when a dehiscence in the vitreous cortex allows fluid from a syneretic cavity to enter the potential subhyaloid space, causing the remaining cortex to be stripped from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-6</span>). As fluid drains out of the syneretic cavities under the newly formed posterior hyaloid, the vitreous body collapses anteriorly, remaining attached at its base. Vitreous detachment generally occurs rapidly over the course of a few hours to days.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An age-related weakening of the adherence of the cortical vitreous to the ILM also plays a role in PVDs. Clinical and pathologic studies have reported a prevalence of 50% or more of PVD in individuals aged 70&#160;years and older. The incidence of PVD is increased in individuals with intraocular inflammation, aphakia or pseudophakia, trauma, myopia, and other vitreoretinal diseases. PVD is important in the pathogenesis of many conditions, including retinal tears and detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and macular hole formation. See BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> for additional discussion.</p>
			<p class="h3">Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and proliferative vitreoretinopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Retinal tears</span> form from vitreous traction on the retina during or after PVD or secondary to ocular trauma. Tears are most likely to occur at sites of greatest vitreoretinal adhesion, such as the vitreous base (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-7</span>) or the margin of lattice degeneration. Histologic examination of retinal tears reveals that the vitreous adheres to the retina along the flap of the tear. In the area of retina separated from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), there is loss of photoreceptors.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Retinal detachment</span> occurs when vitreous traction and fluid currents resulting from eye movements combine to overcome the forces maintaining retinal adhesion to the RPE. The principal histopathologic findings in retinal detachment consist of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">degeneration of the outer segments of the photoreceptors</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">eventual loss of photoreceptor cells</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">migration of Müller cells</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">proliferation and migration of RPE cells</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Small cystic spaces develop in the detached retina, and in chronic detachment, these cysts may coalesce into large macrocysts (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">With rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, cellular membranes may form on either surface (anterior or posterior) of the retina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-9</span>). Clinically, this process is referred to as <span class="italic">proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).</span> These membranes form as a result of proliferation of RPE cells and other cellular elements, including glial cells (Müller cells, fibrous astrocytes), macrophages, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and possibly hyalocytes. The cell biology of PVR is complex and involves the interaction of various growth factors and integrins, as well as cellular proliferation. Studies have shown a significant association between clinical grades of PVR and the expression levels of specific cytokines and/or growth factors in the vitreous fluid.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Macular holes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Idiopathic macular holes most likely form as the result of degenerative changes in the vitreous. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has greatly advanced our understanding of the anatomical features of full-&#173;thickness macular holes and early macular hole formation. These studies are most consistent with a focal vitreomacular traction mechanism. Localized perifoveal vitreous detachment (an early stage of age-&#173;related PVD) appears to be the primary pathogenetic event in idiopathic macular hole formation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-10</span>). Detachment of the posterior hyaloid from the pericentral retina exerts anterior traction on the foveola and localizes the dynamic vitreous traction associated with ocular rotations into the perifoveolar region.</p>
			<p class="body-text">OCT has clarified the pathoanatomy of early macular hole stages, beginning with a foveal pseudocyst (stage&#160;1a), typically followed by disruption of the outer retina (stage&#160;1b), before progressing to a full-&#173;thickness dehiscence (stage&#160;2). Histologically, full-&#173;thickness macular holes are similar to holes in other locations. A full-&#173;thickness retinal defect with rounded tissue margins (stage&#160;3) is accompanied by loss of the photoreceptor outer segments in adjacent retina that is separated from the RPE by subretinal fluid (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-10C</span>). An epiretinal membrane composed of Müller cells, fibrous astrocytes, and fibroblasts with myoblastic differentiation is often present on the surface of the retina adjacent to the macular hole. Cystoid macular edema in the parafoveal retina adjacent to the full-&#173;thickness macular hole is relatively common. Following surgical repair of macular holes, closer apposition of the remaining photoreceptors and variable glial scarring close the macular defect. See BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> for further discussion.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Hemorrhage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A constellation of pathologic features may develop in the vitreous following vitreous hemorrhage. After 3–10&#160;days, red blood cell clots undergo fibrinolysis, and red blood cells may diffuse throughout the vitreous cavity. At this time, breakdown of the red blood cells also occurs. Loss of hemoglobin from the red blood cells produces ghost cells (see Chapter&#160;7, Fig&#160;7-10) and hemoglobin spherules. Obstruction of the trabecular meshwork by these cells may lead to <span class="italic">ghost cell glaucoma.</span> See also BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">The process of red blood cell dissolution attracts macrophages, which phagocytose the effete red blood cells. Iron (Fe<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3+</span>) is released during hemoglobin breakdown. This can occur intracellularly in macrophages with iron storage as ferritin or hemosiderin, or extracellularly with iron binding to vitreous proteins such as lactoferrin and transferrin. In massive hemorrhages, cholesterol crystals caused by the breakdown of red blood cell membranes may be present, often surrounded by a foreign body giant cell reaction. Cholesterol appears clinically as refractile crystals in the vitreous cavity; the crystals are typically not attached to vitreous fibrils (synchysis scintillans). Syneresis of the vitreous and PVD are common after vitreous hemorrhage.</p>
			<p class="h2">Asteroid Hyalosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Asteroid hyalosis is a condition with a spectacular clinical appearance (see Fig&#160;16-9 in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous</span>) but little clinical significance. Histologically, asteroid bodies are rounded structures measuring 10–100&#160;nm, typically attached to vitreous fibrils, that stain positively with alcian blue and with stains for neutral fats, phospholipids, and calcium (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-11</span>). The bodies stain metachromatically and exhibit birefringence. Occasionally, asteroid bodies will be surrounded by a foreign body giant cell reaction, but the condition is not generally associated with vitreous inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The exact mechanism of formation of asteroid bodies is not known; however, element mapping by electron spectroscopic imaging has revealed a homogeneous distribution of calcium, phosphorus, and oxygen. Thus, asteroid bodies exhibit structural and elemental similarity to hydroxyapatite, and proteoglycans and their glycosaminoglycan side chains appear to play a role in regulating the biomineralization process.</p>

			<p class="h2">Vitreous Amyloidosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">amyloidosis</span> refers to a group of diseases that lead to extracellular deposition of amyloid. Amyloid is composed of various types of proteins that have a characteristic ultrastructural appearance of nonbranching fibrils with variable length and a diameter of 75–100&#160;Å. The proteins forming amyloid are able to form a tertiary structure characterized as a β-&#173;pleated sheet, which enables the proteins to bind Congo red stain and show birefringence in polarized light (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-12</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Amyloid’s protein of origin is characteristic for different forms of amyloidosis. Amyloid deposits occur in the vitreous when the protein forming the amyloid is <span class="italic">transthyretin.</span> There are multiple genetic mutations that can result in various amino acid substitutions in the transthyretin protein. The most common mutations were originally described in <span class="italic">familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP).</span> Systemic manifestations in patients with FAP include vitreous opacities and perivascular infiltrates (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-13</span>), peripheral neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and carpal tunnel syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The mechanism by which the vitreous becomes involved is not known with certainty. Because amyloid deposits are found within the walls of retinal vessels and in the RPE and ciliary body, amyloid may gain access to the vitreous through these tissues. In addition, because transthyretin is a blood protein, it may gain access to the vitreous by crossing the blood–aqueous or blood–retina barrier.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Neoplasia</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Intraocular Lymphoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Primary neoplastic involvement of the vitreous is uncommon because of the relatively acellular nature of the vitreous. However, the vitreous can be the site of primary involvement in cases of B-cell lymphoma. This type of lymphoma has been referred to as <span class="italic">primary intraocular/central nervous system lymphoma, large cell lymphoma,</span> and <span class="italic">vitreoretinal/retinal lymphoma.</span> Immunohistochemical and molecular genetic studies have confirmed that this entity is typically a B-cell lymphoma; however, T-cell lymphomas may occur in rare instances.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinically, <span class="italic">primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL)</span> presents most commonly as a vitritis. Some patients have sub-RPE infiltrates (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-14</span>) with a very characteristic speckled pigmentation overlying tumor detachments of the RPE. The sub-RPE infiltrates are present in a minority of patients with intraocular lymphoma. Recent evidence suggests that the lymphoma cells may be attracted to the RPE by B-cell chemokines and subsequently migrate from the sub-RPE space into the vitreous. More than half of patients presenting with ocular findings have or will develop involvement of the central nervous system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma can be challenging and relies primarily on cytologic analysis of vitreous and/or subretinal specimens. Cytologically, the vitreous infiltrate in intraocular lymphoma is heterogeneous. The atypical cells are large lymphoid cells, frequently with a convoluted nuclear membrane and multiple, conspicuous nucleoli. An accompanying infiltrate of small lymphocytes almost always appears, and the normal cells may obscure the neoplastic cell population. These small round lymphocytes are mostly reactive T&#160;cells. Numerous necrotic cells are usually present, and this feature is very suggestive of a diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-15</span>). Immunohistochemically, the viable tumor cells can be labeled as a monoclonal population of B&#160;cells. Flow cytometry is helpful in demonstrating a monoclonal population. Other laboratory tests that may be useful in the diagnosis and follow-&#173;up of patients with intraocular lymphoma are determination of the interleukin-10 to interleukin-6 ratio and the use of microdissection and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and translocation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The subretinal/sub-RPE infiltrates are composed of neoplastic lymphoid cells (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-16</span>). With or without treatment, the subretinal infiltrates may resolve, leaving a focal area of RPE atrophy. Optic nerve and retinal infiltration may also be present. Infiltrates in these locations tend to be perivascular and may lead to ischemic retinal or optic nerve damage. The choroid is typically free of lymphoma cells; however, secondary chronic inflammation may be present in the choroid. In the setting of systemic lymphoma with ocular involvement, the choroid (rather than the vitreous, retina, or subretinal space) is the primary site of involvement (see Chapter&#160;12 for more on choroidal lymphoma).</p>
