			<div id="Chapt8_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The sclera is the white, nearly opaque portion of the outer wall of the eye that covers from four-fifths to five-sixths of the eye’s surface area. It is continuous anteriorly at the limbus with the corneal stroma. Posteriorly, the outer two-thirds of the sclera merge with the optic nerve dural sheath; the inner third continues as perforated sclera known as the lamina cribrosa, through which pass axonal fibers of the optic nerve (see Chapter&#160;15, Fig&#160;15-1). Histologically, the sclera is divided into 3&#160;layers (from outermost inward): episclera, stroma, and lamina fusca (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-1</span>). Embryologically, the sclera is derived predominantly from the neural crest. See BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The episclera is a loose, thin fibrovascular tissue that covers the outer surface of the scleral stroma. The bulk of the sclera is made up of the stroma, a layer of sparsely vascularized, dense type&#160;I collagen fibers. In comparison to corneal stroma, scleral collagen fibers are thicker and more variable in thickness and orientation. Transmural emissary canals provide outlets within the stroma as follows (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-2</span>; see also Fig&#160;8-1):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">in the posterior region, for posterior ciliary arteries and nerves</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">in the equatorial region, for vortex veins</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">in the anterior regions, for anterior ciliary arteries and veins and long posterior ciliary nerves (Axenfeld nerve loops)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The lamina fusca is a delicate, pigmented fibrovascular tissue that loosely binds the uvea to the sclera. Sclerouveal attachments are strongest along the major emissary canals, the anterior base of the ciliary body, and the juxtapapillary region.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Nanophthalmos</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nanophthalmos is a rare, usually bilateral, developmental disorder characterized by an eye with short axial length (&lt;20&#160;mm), a normal or slightly enlarged lens, thickened sclera, hyperopia, and a predisposition to uveal effusion and glaucoma. Most cases are sporadic, but both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns have been reported. Autosomal recessive cases have been linked to mutations in the MFRP gene that encodes a frizzle-&#173;related transmembrane protein, selectively expressed in retinal pigment epithelium and ciliary body.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In studies of patients with nanophthalmos, the collagen fibrils in the characteristic thick and nonelastic sclera demonstrated fraying and splitting, and abnormalities were found in the glycosaminoglycan matrix. These scleral changes may predispose the nanophthalmic eye to uveal effusion due to reduced protein permeability and impaired venous outflow through the vortex veins.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nanophthalmic eyes are predisposed to angle-&#173;closure glaucoma due to a normal or enlarged lens in a small anterior segment.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Microphthalmos</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Microphthalmos refers to small eyes with associated developmental defects. Colobomas and cysts with associated scleral abnormalities are also common, due to failure of the fetal fissure to close properly.</p>

			<p class="h1">Inflammations</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for additional discussion of episcleritis and scleritis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Episcleritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Episcleritis is classified as simple or nodular. <span class="italic">Simple episcleritis</span> is a self-&#173;limited, often idiopathic condition. Histologic examination shows vascular congestion, stromal edema, and a chronic nongranulomatous perivascular inflammatory infiltrate that is composed primarily of lymphocytes.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Nodular episcleritis</span> more often affects females and those with systemic illness, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is characterized by tender, elevated, pink-red nodules on the anterior episclera. Histologically, the nodules are composed of a <span class="italic">necrobiotic granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate,</span> which is a palisading arrangement of epithelioid histiocytes around a central core of necrotic collagen. This light microscopic pattern is the same as that seen in rheumatoid nodules in subcutaneous tissue.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Scleritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Scleritis can be infectious or noninfectious; infectious scleritis may be distinguished from noninfectious scleritis by appropriate laboratory testing. Special stains may aid in identifying causative organisms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Noninfectious scleritis is often a painful, progressive ocular disease with potentially serious sequelae. Histologic examination of noninfectious scleritis reveals 2&#160;main categories: necrotizing and nonnecrotizing inflammation. Either type may occur anteriorly or posteriorly, but anterior scleritis is more common (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-3</span>). <span class="italic">Necrotizing scleritis</span> may be nodular or diffuse (also called brawny scleritis) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-4</span>). Both patterns demonstrate granulomas similar to those of episcleritis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-5</span>). A rim of lymphocytes and plasma cells is peripheral to the histiocytes. Multiple foci may show different stages of evolution. In the course of healing, the necrotic stroma is resorbed, leaving a thinned scleral remnant prone to staphyloma formation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-6</span>). Severe ectasia of the scleral shell predisposes the sclera to herniation of uveal tissue through the defect, a condition known as <span class="italic">scleromalacia perforans.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Nonnecrotizing scleritis</span> is characterized by a perivascular lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrate without a granulomatous inflammatory component. Vasculitis may be present in the form of fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for additional discussion of episcleritis and scleritis.</p>

			<p class="h1">Degenerations</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Senile Calcific Plaque</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Senile calcific plaques occur commonly in individuals over 70&#160;years of age; they appear as flat, firm, sharply circumscribed, rectangular to ovoid gray scleral patches. The plaques, which appear bilaterally, are typically located anterior to the medial and lateral rectus muscle insertions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-7A</span>) in the interpalpebral fissure. The etiology is unknown; various causes, such as dehydration, actinic damage, and stress on scleral collagen exerted by rectus muscle insertions, have been proposed but not proven.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologic sections show that the calcium is present within the midportion of the scleral stroma. It begins as a finely granular deposition but may progress to a confluent plaque involving both superficial and deep sclera (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-7B</span>). Senile plaques may be highlighted by special stains for calcium, such as von Kossa and alizarin red.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Scleral Staphyloma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Scleral staphylomas are scleral ectasias that are lined internally by uveal tissue. Staphylomas may develop at points of weakness in the scleral shell, either in inherently thin areas (such as posterior to the rectus muscle insertions; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-8</span>) or in areas weakened by tissue destruction (as in scleritis; see Fig&#160;8-6). In children, staphylomas may occur as a result of long-&#173;standing increased intraocular pressure or axial myopia, owing to the relative distensibility of the sclera in the young. Location and age at onset, therefore, vary according to the underlying etiology. Histologic examination invariably reveals thinned sclera, with or without fibrosis and scarring, depending on the cause.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Neoplasia</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neoplasms of the sclera are exceedingly rare. Tumors originate predominantly in the conjunctiva or uvea with secondary scleral involvement.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Fibrous Histiocytoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fibrous histiocytoma <span class="italic">(fibroxanthoma)</span> and its malignant variant <span class="italic">(pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma)</span> can occur in the sclera (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-9</span>), although it is rare.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See Chapter&#160;14 for further discussion of fibrous histiocytomas.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Nodular Fasciitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nodular fasciitis is a reactive process that may, in rare instances, cause a mass in the episclera. The disease usually affects young adults, 20 to 40&#160;years of age, as a rapidly growing, round to oval, firm, white-gray nodule that measures 0.5–1.5&#160;cm and appears at the limbus or anterior to a rectus muscle insertion. In other body sites, antecedent trauma has been implicated as an etiologic factor for the development of nodular fasciitis, but in the sclera such an association is infrequent. Though self-&#173;limited, nodular fasciitis is usually excised because of its rapid growth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologic examination reveals a circumscribed spindle cell proliferation in which the appearance of individual cells resembles that of fibroblasts growing in tissue culture. These spindle cells aggregate in short fascicles (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-10</span>). Older lesions may show foci of dense collagen deposition. Although mitotic figures may be present, atypical mitoses are absent. When diagnosing, the clinician should avoid the pitfall of misinterpreting nodular fasciitis histologically as sarcoma (soft-&#173;tissue malignancy); this can happen because of the cellular nature of the proliferations and the presence of mitotic figures.</p>
