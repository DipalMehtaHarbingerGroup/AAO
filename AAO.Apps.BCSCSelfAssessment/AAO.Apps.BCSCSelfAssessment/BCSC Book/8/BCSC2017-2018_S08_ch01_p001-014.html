			</div>
			<p class="h1">Eyelids</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The functions of the eyelid are protection of the eye, distribution of tears, mechanical cleaning of the ocular surface, regulation of light exposure for the eye, and partial production of the tear film. The eyelid is composed of skin, subcutaneous connective tissue, fibrous tissue (tarsus), muscle, and mucous membrane (palpebral conjunctiva). The eyelid skin varies in thickness, from 0.5&#160;mm at the eyelid margin to 1&#160;mm at the orbital rim. Except for fine vellus hairs, the eyelashes (cilia) are the only hairs of the eyelids and are twice as numerous along the upper eyelid compared with the lower margin. Eyelashes are replaced every 3–5&#160;months and usually regrow in 2&#160;weeks when cut and within 2&#160;months if epilated. They catch small particles and also work as sensors to stimulate reflex eyelid closure. Blinking stimulates the lacrimal pump to release tears, which are then spread across the cornea, flushing foreign material. Most individuals blink an average of 10–15&#160;times per minute at rest, 20&#160;times per minute or more during a conversation, and as few as 5&#160;times per minute when concentrating (eg, reading). Blink frequency has also been shown to change in different positions of gaze. The orbicularis oculi muscle, which is innervated by cranial nerve (CN)&#160;VII, closes the upper and lower eyelids (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-1</span>). The levator palpebrae muscle, innervated by CN&#160;III, inserts into the tarsal plate and skin and elevates the upper eyelid. The Müller muscle, innervated by sympathetic nerves, increases the width of the palpebral fissure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The epidermis of the eyelids abruptly changes from keratinized to nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium at the mucocutaneous junction of the eyelid margin, along the row of <span class="italic">meibomian gland</span> orifices. Holocrine sebaceous glands and eccrine sweat glands are present in the eyelid skin. Near the eyelid margin are apocrine sweat glands (the <span class="italic">glands </span><span class="italic">of Moll</span>) and numerous modified sebaceous glands (the <span class="italic">glands of Zeis</span>).</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Lacrimal Functional Unit</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lacrimal functional unit (LFU; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-2</span>) is a highly complex apparatus comprising the lacrimal glands, ocular surface, and eyelids, as well as the sensory and motor nerves that connect these components. The LFU is responsible for the regulation, production, and health of the tear film. The LFU responds to environmental, endocrinologic, and cortical influences. Its overall functions are to preserve the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-4">integrity of the tear film (by carrying out lubricating, antimicrobial, and nutritional roles)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">health of the ocular surface (by maintaining corneal transparency and the surface stem cell population)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-5">the quality of the image projected onto the retina</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The afferent component of the LFU is mediated through ocular surface and trigeminal nociceptors, which synapse in the brainstem with autonomic and motor (efferent) nerves. The autonomic nerve fibers innervate the meibomian glands, conjunctival goblet cells, and lacrimal glands. The motor nerve fibers innervate the orbicularis muscle to initiate blinking. During blinking, the meibomian glands express lipid, and the tears are replenished from the inferior tear meniscus and spread across the cornea while excess tears are directed into the lacrimal puncta.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Tear Film</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Our understanding of the structure and composition of the tear film has gradually evolved. The tear film was formerly described as a structure composed of 3&#160;layers: lipid (expressed from the meibomian glands), aqueous (expressed from the lacrimal gland), and mucin (produced primarily by goblet cells). It is now thought of as a uniform gel consisting of soluble mucus, which is secreted by conjunctival goblet cells, mixed with fluids and proteins secreted by the lacrimal glands (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The air–tear film interface at the surface of the cornea constitutes the primary refractive element of the eye. The tear film is primarily responsible for maintaining a smooth optical surface between blinks. It also serves as a medium to remove irritants and pathogens and contains a variety of elements that control the normal ocular flora. Further, tears dilute toxins and allergens and allow for the diffusion of oxygen and other nutrients. Maintenance of the tear film is thus critical to normal corneal function.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Conjunctiva</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The conjunctiva can be broadly divided as follows: bulbar (covers the eyeball), forniceal (covers the superior and inferior fornices), and palpebral, or tarsal (starts at the mucocutaneous junction of the eyelid and covers the inner eyelid). The <span class="italic">caruncle</span>—a fleshy, ovoid modified mass approximately 5 mm high and 3 mm wide, containing the lacus lacrimalis—<br />is attached to the inferomedial side of the plica semilunaris and bears goblet cells and lacrimal tissue, as well as hairs, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. The <span class="italic">plica semilunaris</span> is a crescent-&#173;shaped vertical fold at the medial angle of the eye. The <span class="italic">palpebral,</span> or <span class="italic">tarsal, conjunctiva</span> is tightly adherent to the underlying tarsus. The <span class="italic">bulbar conjunctiva</span> is loosely attached to the Tenon capsule, and both insert into the limbus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cell morphology of the conjunctival epithelium varies from stratified cuboidal over the tarsus and columnar in the fornices to squamous on the globe. Goblet cells account for up to 10% of basal cells of the conjunctival epithelium and are most numerous in the tarsal conjunctiva, the inferonasal bulbar conjunctiva, and in the area of the plica semilunaris.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">substantia propria</span> of the conjunctiva consists of loose connective tissue. Conjunctiva-&#173;associated lymphoid tissue (CALT), which consists of lymphocytes and other leukocytes, is present, especially in the fornices. Lymphocytes interact with mucosal epithelial cells through reciprocal regulatory signals mediated by growth factors, cytokines, and neuropeptides.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The palpebral conjunctiva shares its blood supply with the eyelids. The bulbar conjunctiva is supplied by the anterior ciliary arteries, which arise from muscular branches of the ophthalmic artery. These capillaries are fenestrated and leak fluid, producing chemosis (conjunctival swelling), as a response to allergies or other inflammatory events.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Cornea</p>
            <div id="Chapt1_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cornea is a transparent, avascular tissue that consists of 5&#160;layers (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-4</span>): epithelium, Bowman, stroma, Descemet membrane, and endothelium; these are discussed in the following subsections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In adults, the cornea measures 11–12&#160;mm horizontally and 10–11&#160;mm vertically. It is approximately 500–600 µm thick at its center and gradually increases in thickness toward the periphery. The cornea is aspheric, although the central portion of the anterior corneal surface is often described as a spherocylindrical convex mirror. The general refractive index of the cornea is 1.376. The average radius of curvature of the anterior central cornea is 7.8&#160;mm, which would produce a dioptric power of 43.25&#160;D for the front surface of the cornea, using the keratometer calibration index of 1.3375. The total dioptric power of a normal human eye is 58.60&#160;D, to which the cornea contributes 74%. The cornea is also the major source of astigmatism in the human optical system. For further discussion of corneal optics, see Evaluation of Corneal Curvature in Chapter&#160;2.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For its nutrition, the cornea depends on diffusion of glucose from the aqueous humor and of oxygen through the tear film. In addition, the peripheral cornea is supplied with oxygen from the limbal circulation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The density of nerve endings in the cornea is among the highest in the body, and the sensitivity of the cornea is 100&#160;times that of the conjunctiva. Sensory nerve fibers extend from the long ciliary nerves and form a subepithelial plexus.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Corneal Epithelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The corneal epithelium is composed of 4–6&#160;layers, which include 1–2&#160;layers of superficial squamous cells, 2–3&#160;layers of broad wing cells, and an innermost layer of columnar basal cells. It is 40–50 µm thick (see Fig&#160;1-4; also see the Pachymetry section in Chapter&#160;2). The epithelium and tear film form an optically smooth surface. Tight junctions between superficial epithelial cells prevent penetration of tear fluid into the stroma. Continuous proliferation of limbal stem cells gives rise to the other layers, which subsequently differentiate into superficial cells. With maturation, these differentiated cells become coated with microvilli on their outermost surface and then desquamate into the tears. The process of differentiation takes approximately 7–14&#160;days. Basal epithelial cells secrete a continuous, 50-nm-thick basement membrane, which is composed of type&#160;IV collagen, laminin, and other proteins. Corneal clarity depends on the tight packing of epithelial cells, which results in a layer with a nearly uniform refractive index and minimal light scattering.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Bowman Layer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Bowman layer lies anterior to the corneal stroma. Previously considered a membrane, the Bowman layer is rather the acellular condensate of the most anterior portion of the stroma (see Fig&#160;1-4). This layer is 15 µm thick and helps maintain the shape of the cornea. When disrupted, it will not regenerate.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Corneal Stroma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The corneal stroma makes up roughly 90% of the total corneal thickness (see Fig&#160;1-4). The regular arrangement of stromal cells (keratocytes), fibers, and extracellular matrix is necessary for a clear cornea. Keratocytes vary in size and density throughout the stroma and form a 3-dimensional network throughout the cornea. They are flattened fibroblasts, located between the stromal collagen lamellae (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-5</span>), and they continually digest and manufacture stromal molecules. Keratocyte density declines with age, by 0.9% per year for anterior density and by 0.3% per year for posterior density. It can also decline with refractive laser surgery and may not be completely restored.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The corneal stroma is composed of an extracellular matrix formed of collagens and proteoglycans. Type&#160;I and type&#160;V fibrillar collagens are intertwined with filaments of type&#160;VI collagen. The major corneal proteoglycans are decorin (associated with dermatan sulfate) and lumican (associated with keratan sulfate).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal transparency depends on maintaining the water content of the corneal stroma at 78%. Corneal hydration is largely controlled by intact epithelial and endothelial barriers and the functioning of the endothelial pump, which is linked to an ion-&#173;transport system controlled by temperature-&#173;dependent enzymes such as Na<span class="CharOverride-2">+</span>,K<span class="CharOverride-2">+</span>-ATPase. In addition, negatively charged stromal glycosaminoglycans tend to repel each other, producing a <span class="italic">swelling pressure (SP).</span> Because the intraocular pressure (IOP) tends to compress the cornea, the overall imbibition pressure of the corneal stroma is given as IOP – SP. The total transendothelial osmotic force is calculated by adding the imbibition pressure and the various electrolyte gradients produced by the endothelial transport channels. Corneal hydration varies from anterior to posterior and increases closer to the endothelium.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Descemet Membrane</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Descemet membrane is the basement membrane of the corneal endothelium (see Fig&#160;1-4). It is 3&#160;µm at birth and increases in size, to 10–12&#160;µm in adulthood, as the endothelium gradually lays down a posterior amorphous, nonbanded zone. Though controversial, a novel layer in the posterior part of the cornea (pre-&#173;Descemet layer or Dua’s layer) has been reported. This layer may be important during deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. The <span class="italic">Schwalbe line</span> is a gonioscopic landmark that defines the end of the Descemet membrane and the beginning of the trabecular meshwork.</p>

			<p class="h2">Corneal Endothelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal endothelial cells lie on the posterior surface of the cornea, composing a monolayer of closely interdigitated cells arranged in a mosaic pattern of mostly hexagonal shapes (see Fig&#160;1-4). Human endothelial cells do not proliferate in vivo, but they can divide in cell culture. If cell loss occurs, especially as a result of trauma or surgery, the defective area is covered via enlargement and spread of residual cells or perhaps peripheral stem cells. These cell findings can be observed by specular microscopy as polymegethism (variability in cell size) and polymorphism (variability in cell shape). Cell density varies over the endothelial surface; normally, the concentration is highest in the periphery. Central endothelial cell density decreases with age at an average rate of approximately 0.6%/year, diminishing from a count of about 3400&#160;cells/mm<span class="CharOverride-2">2</span> at age 15&#160;years to about 2300&#160;cells/mm<span class="CharOverride-2">2</span> at age 85&#160;years. The normal central endothelial cell count is between 2000 and 3000&#160;cells/mm<span class="CharOverride-2">2</span>. It has been observed that eyes with an endothelial cell count below 500&#160;cells/mm<span class="CharOverride-2">2</span> may be at risk for development of corneal edema. The endothelium maintains corneal transparency by controlling corneal hydration and maintaining stromal deturgescence through its functions as a barrier to the aqueous humor and as a metabolic pump that moves ions, and draws water osmotically, from the stroma into the aqueous humor. The barrier and pump functions of the endothelium can be measured clinically by fluorophotometry and pachymetry. The endothelium must also be permeable to nutrients and other molecules from the aqueous humor. Increased permeability and insufficient pump sites occur with reduced endothelial cell density, although the cell density at which clinically evident edema occurs is not an absolute.</p>

			<p class="h1">Limbus</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The limbus is the transition zone between transparent cornea and opaque sclera. This area harbors corneal epithelial stem cells, which are responsible for the normal homeostasis and wound repair of the corneal epithelium. The <span class="italic">palisades of Vogt,</span> which are concentrated in the superior and inferior limbus, are thought to be the site of the limbal stem cells’ niche and can be observed biomicroscopically as radially oriented fibrovascular ridges concentrated along the corneoscleral limbus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-6</span>). The posterior limbus appears to be responsible for stem cell maintenance, while the function of the anterior limbus may be to prompt regeneration of corneal epithelium. Renewal occurs from basal cells, with centripetal migration of stem cells from the periphery. This is known as the<span class="italic"> XYZ hypothesis,</span> where <span class="italic">X</span> represents proliferation and stratification of limbal basal cells; <span class="italic">Y,</span> centripetal migration of basal cells; and <span class="italic">Z,</span> desquamation of superficial cells. The health of the cornea depends on the sum of X and Y being equal to Z. Damage to epithelial stem cells impairs long-term regeneration of corneal epithelial cells. Damage to the limbus leads to loss of the barrier that prevents invasion of the conjunctiva and neovascularization of the ocular surface.</p>

			<p class="h1">Defense Mechanisms of the External Eye and Cornea</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The external eye and cornea comprise complexly integrated tissues that, along with the tear film, help protect the eye against infection. For an in-depth discussion of the various features of the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, see BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span> BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> discusses the biochemistry, metabolism, and immunology of the tear film and cornea in detail.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Components of the ocular adnexa—periorbital area, eyelids and lashes, lacrimal and meibomian glands—play different but important roles in the production, spread, and drainage of the tear film. As discussed earlier, the tear film serves as a protective layer, washing away irritants and pathogens and diluting toxins and allergens. Each functional blink promotes tear turnover. Tears are secreted from the lacrimal gland and spread across the cornea while excess tears are directed into the lacrimal puncta; all of these actions reduce the contact time of microbes and irritants with the ocular surface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Immunoregulation of the ocular surface occurs through tolerance and regulation of the innate and adaptive arms of the ocular immune response (Fig 1-7). The normal tear film contains components of the complement cascade, proteins, growth factors, and an array of cytokines. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor&#160;<span class="CharOverride-3">α</span> are significantly upregulated in a variety of corneal inflammatory diseases, such as corneal graft rejection and dry eye disease. Similarly, increased expression of growth factors, prostaglandins, neuropeptides, and proteases has been observed in a wide array of immune disorders of the ocular surface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The normal, uninflamed conjunctiva contains polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils), lymphocytes (including regulatory T&#160;cells [Treg cells], which dampen the immune response), macrophages, plasma cells, and mast cells. The conjunctival stroma has an endowment of dendritic antigen-&#173;presenting cells (APCs). The conjunctival epithelium contains a special subpopulation of dendritic APCs known as <span class="italic">Langerhans cells,</span> which are capable of both uptake of antigens and priming (sensitizing) of naive (antigen-&#173;inexperienced) T&#160;lymphocytes. Hence, these dendritic cells serve as the sentinel cells of the immune system of the ocular surface. In addition to containing immune cells, the conjunctiva has a plentiful supply of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, which facilitate the trafficking of immune cells and antigens to the draining lymph nodes, where the adaptive immune response is generated. This occurs through the recruitment of Treg cells, which return to the ocular surface to modulate and suppress the local immune response.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The normal, uninflamed cornea, like the conjunctiva, is also endowed with dendritic cells. Like those in the conjunctiva, the dendritic APCs in the corneal epithelium are Langerhans cells. They are located primarily in the corneal periphery and limbus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-8</span>). These APCs are in an activated, mature state (expressing class&#160;II major histocompatibility complex [MHC] antigens and costimulatory molecules) and hence are capable of efficiently stimulating T&#160;cells. In addition to these dendritic cells, small numbers of lymphocytes are present in the peripheral epithelium and anterior stroma of the cornea. A highly regulated process, mediated by vascular endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines, controls the recruitment of the various leukocyte subsets from the intravascular compartment into the limbal matrix. Immune responses are also mediated by Treg cells in the regional lymph nodes and perhaps at the local level as well. See also Chapter&#160;11 on corneal graft rejection.</p>

					<p class="figure-caption ParaOverride-8"><span class="figure-number">Figure 1-7</span> Immunoregulation of the ocular surface. <span class="figure-caption-bold">A,</span>&#160;Immunoregulation of the ocular surface: The ocular surface tissues contain a variety of soluble and cellular factors to reduce inflammation-&#173;induced pathology in the lacrimal functional unit. Those implicated in immunoregulation within the ocular surface tissues include the following: (1)&#160;Natural regulatory T&#160;cells (nTreg cells) (eg, CD4<span class="CharOverride-2">+</span>, CD8<span class="CharOverride-2">+</span>, and natural killer T&#160;cells), which include many of the conjunctival intraepithelial lymphocytes, are thought to dampen or inhibit the inflammatory/autoimmune response on the ocular surface. (2)&#160;The anti-&#173;inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor&#160;<span class="greek--fig-caption-">b</span> (TGF-<span class="greek--fig-caption-">b</span>) is present on the ocular surface and has profound suppressive effects on resident dendritic cell (DC) maturation in the cornea; proliferation, differentiation, and survival of autoreactive T&#160;cells; and Treg cell differentiation and maintenance. The activity of the potent acute-&#173;response, proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is modulated by the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), which is expressed and secreted by corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) also seems to be protective; VIP secreted by sensory nerve endings in the cornea increases production of TGF-<span class="greek--fig-caption-">b</span> and IL-10 and inhibits expression of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, IL-1<span class="greek--fig-caption-">b</span>, tumor necrosis factor&#160;<span class="greek--fig-caption-">a</span>, interferon-<span class="greek--fig-caption-">c</span>, and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand&#160;2. Hormones are also implicated in curbing inflammation and maintaining homeostasis. In addition, the corneal epithelium expresses vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-1 to sequester VEGF and reduce neovascularization. (3)&#160;Antigen-&#173;presenting cells (APCs) bearing self-&#173;antigen derived at the ocular surface may migrate to the regional lymph nodes to induce antigen-&#173;specific Treg cells (iTreg cells). <span class="figure-caption-bold">B,</span>&#160;Immunoregulation in the lymphoid organs: nTreg cells may exert their immunosuppressive function through (1)&#160;release of soluble factors (eg, TGF-<span class="greek--fig-caption-">b</span>, IL-10); </p>
