			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1 body-text--no-indent-"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Exposure keratopathy can develop as a result of any disease associated with poor blinking or any process that limits eyelid closure. Lagophthalmos can be caused by the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">neurogenic disease such as seventh nerve palsy</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">degenerative neurologic conditions such as Parkinson disease</li>

				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">proptosis (eg, due to thyroid eye disease or other inflammatory or infiltrative orbital disease)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> When corneal sensation is normal, the symptoms of exposure keratopathy are similar to those associated with dry eye, including foreign-&#173;body sensation and photophobia. Exposure keratopathy is characterized by punctate epithelial erosions that usually involve the inferior one-third of the cornea; however, the entire corneal surface can be involved in severe cases. Large, coalescent epithelial defects may result, which may in turn lead to infectious or sterile ulceration and perforation. The risk of a stromal melt is greater when exposure is associated with a neurotrophic or anesthetic cornea (see the section Neurotrophic Keratopathy and Persistent Corneal Epithelial Defects).</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Therapy is similar to that for severe evaporative dry eye. In the earliest stages, nonpreserved artificial tears instilled during the day and ointment applied at bedtime may suffice. Taping the eyelid shut at bedtime can help if the exposure occurs mainly during sleep. Bandage contact lenses should be used with caution in patients with exposure keratopathy because of the risk of desiccation and infection. For cases in which the problem is likely to be temporary or self-&#173;limited, temporary tarsorrhaphy using tissue adhesive or sutures may be helpful. However, if the problem is likely to be long-&#173;standing, definitive surgical therapy to correct the exposure is recommended.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most commonly, surgical management consists of permanent lateral and/or medial tarsorrhaphy (see Chapter&#160;13). Insertion of gold or platinum weights into the upper eyelid is also an effective, more cosmetic approach to promote eyelid closure. Reported complications of gold weight implants include infection, implant malposition, extrusion, induced astigmatism, unacceptable ptosis, and noninfectious inflammatory response to the gold. The weights remain stable during magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, correction of any associated eyelid abnormalities, such as ectropion, entropion, and/or trichiasis, is indicated. For example, in cases of paralytic ectropion of the lower eyelid, a horizontal tightening procedure may also be beneficial.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Neurotrophic Keratopathy and Persistent Corneal Epithelial Defects</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top3">
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1 body-text--no-indent-"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> There are a number of causes of neurotrophic keratopathy, one being damage to cranial nerve&#160;V, which results in corneal hypoesthesia or anesthesia (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;4-1</span>). Probably the most common cause of neurotrophic keratopathy is herpetic keratitis, which can be associated with persistent or recurrent corneal epithelial defects in the absence of replicating virus or active inflammation. A neurotrophic cornea can also occur after penetrating keratoplasty or deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty, in the early postoperative period.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some medications used to treat ocular surface disease and glaucoma may impair epithelial wound healing, resulting in the formation of persistent corneal epithelial defects. The drugs most frequently implicated include topical anesthetics, topical nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), trifluridine, β-&#173;blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and, in sensitive individuals, all eyedrops containing the preservative benzalkonium chloride (BAK). Some authors refer to the condition as <span class="italic">toxic ulcerative keratopathy.</span> This clinical problem usually presents as a diffuse punctate keratopathy, and the cause may be unrecognized by the ophthalmologist. In some instances, pericentral pseudodendritiform lesions and pseudogeographic defects may occur. These clinical findings are often misinterpreted as a worsening of the underlying disease and thus may lead to more frequent dosing of the offending medication.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with diabetic retinopathy, persistent epithelial defects often occur following epithelial debridement in the course of vitreoretinal procedures. Diabetic neuropathy is thought to be a potential cause of neurotrophic keratopathy and nonhealing epithelial defects.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Persistent corneal epithelial defects typically occur in the central or paracentral cornea and tend to be located inferiorly or inferonasally because of the protective effect of the Bell phenomenon on the superior cornea. The round or oval lesions frequently have elevated gray-white edges of “heaped-&#173;up” epithelium, which are associated with underlying stromal inflammation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-1</span>). Left untreated, persistent corneal epithelial defects can progress to vascularization and corneal opacification or corneal thinning and possible perforation. Secondary bacterial keratitis may also occur in this setting.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Management of neurotrophic keratopathy with or without persistent epithelial defect starts with eliminating or limiting the use of potentially aggravating topical medications to the degree possible. Frequent lubrication with nonpreserved drops, gels, or ointments is suggested. Autologous serum drops (20%), which contain growth factors and fibronectin, can be useful. In cases involving significant dry eye, temporary or permanent punctal occlusion can be effective in improving the volume and stability of the tear film and restoring the ocular surface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patching, low-water-&#173;content bandage lenses (soft, thin, highly oxygen-&#173;permeable lenses), or scleral contact lenses with a fluid-&#173;filled reservoir may facilitate reepithelialization or improve the keratopathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In cases associated with stromal melting, medications with specific activity against matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as a tetracycline administered orally, may help prevent or halt keratolysis. Corneal crosslinking performed early in the course of stromal ulceration has been reported to be useful in a small number of patients. Amniotic membrane transplantation has been reported to encourage healing of persistent epithelial erosions. Lateral and/or medial tarsorrhaphy may be required to prevent ocular surface desiccation. Tarsorrhaphy, which can be performed in a temporary or permanent manner, decreases the ocular surface area and tear film evaporation. Partial or total conjunctival flaps prevent corneal melting, but they should be used as a last resort. See Chapter&#160;13 for further discussion of surgical management of ocular surface disorders.</p>

			<p class="h1">Floppy Eyelid Syndrome</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Floppy eyelid syndrome is an ophthalmic disorder consisting of chronic ocular irritation and inflammation and characterized by a lax upper tarsus that everts with minimal upward force applied to the upper eyelid. The syndrome is most frequently seen in obese individuals, who often have obstructive sleep apnea. Clinical findings include small to large papillae on the upper palpebral conjunctiva, mucous discharge, and corneal involvement ranging from mild punctate epitheliopathy to superficial vascularization (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-2</span>). Keratoconus has also been reported in patients with floppy eyelid syndrome. The problem may result from spontaneous eversion of the upper eyelid when it comes into contact with the pillow or other bed linens during sleep. This may result in trauma to the upper tarsal conjunctiva, inducing inflammation and chronic irritation. The condition is most often bilateral but can be asymmetric or unilateral if the patient always sleeps on the same side. The differential diagnosis includes vernal conjunctivitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, and toxic keratopathy. Treatment consists of covering the affected eye with a metal shield, taping the eyelids closed at night, or performing a surgical procedure to tighten the upper eyelid. See also BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>

			<p class="h1">Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) is a chronic, recurrent inflammatory condition involving the superior tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva, as well as the superior limbus and superior cornea.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The pathogenesis of SLK has not been established, but the condition is thought to result from mechanical trauma transmitted from the upper eyelid to the superior bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva. An association with autoimmune thyroid disease has been observed. In addition, SLK has been associated with graft-vs-host disease and has been seen following blepharoplasty.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> SLK is a chronic, recurrent condition characterized by ocular irritation and injection superiorly. It is most frequently seen in women between 20 and 70&#160;years of age and may recur over a period of 1–10&#160;years. Vision is not usually affected. SLK is often bilateral but can be asymmetric. The condition can be associated with aqueous tear deficiency (ATD) or blepharospasm. Ocular findings may include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">a fine papillary reaction on the superior tarsal conjunctiva</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">injection and thickening of the superior bulbar conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-3A</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">hypertrophy of the superior limbus</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">fine punctate fluorescein, lissamine green, or rose bengal staining of the superior bulbar conjunctiva above the limbus with involvement of the superior cornea just below the limbus (Fig&#160;4-3B)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">superior filamentary keratitis</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This condition must be differentiated from contact lens–induced keratoconjunctivitis (CLK), which is in effect a focal limbal stem cell deficiency. Unlike in SLK, vision in CLK may be impaired by punctate keratopathy, which extends through the visual axis. Also, in CLK, filamentary keratitis does not typically occur, and contact lens wear is a cause, not a treatment.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Hyperproliferation, acanthosis, loss of goblet cells, and keratinization are seen in histologic sections of the superior bulbar conjunctiva. SLK can often be diagnosed clinically. However, scrapings or impression cytology of the superior bulbar conjunctiva showing characteristic features of nuclear pyknosis with “snake nuclei,” increased epithelial cytoplasm–nucleus ratio, goblet cell loss, or keratinization may be helpful in the diagnosis of mild or confusing cases. Patients with SLK should undergo thyroid function tests, including free thyroxine (T<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span>), thyroid-&#173;stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid antibodies.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> A variety of therapies have been reported to provide temporary or permanent relief of symptoms, but in general, medical treatment of SLK is less effective than surgical treatment. Medical treatment options include topical anti-&#173;inflammatory agents, topical cyclosporine, autologous serum eyedrops, and large-&#173;diameter bandage contact lenses. Surgical options include thermocauterization of the superior bulbar conjunctiva, resection of the superior limbal bulbar conjunctiva, amniotic membrane transplantation, and conjunctival fixation sutures.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Conjunctivochalasis</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Conjunctivochalasis</span> is a term used to describe laxity or redundancy of the otherwise normal conjunctiva. The condition is typically seen in the inferior bulbar conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-4</span>). The tissue may roll up on the eyelid margin or over the lacrimal punctum, in which case it may obstruct tear outflow.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> The pathogenesis has not been established but may be similar to that of SLK (see the section Superior Limbic Keratoconjunctivitis). Histologic studies have revealed elastosis and chronic nongranulomatous inflammation. In addition, collagenolysis may explain the conjunctival laxity.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Patients typically present with chronic ocular irritation that does not respond to treatment with topical lubricants or topical corticosteroid. They may also present with epiphora. In addition to the conjunctival folds on the eyelid margin, punctate staining may be observed. This surface disruption is presumably caused by conjunctival tissue chafing against itself with movement of the eye. These patients may be predisposed to recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhages. A grading system has been proposed (see Meller and Tseng reference) that may help characterize the findings in this underrecognized condition.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h5-head">management</span> It is reasonable to try topical lubricants, antihistamines, a short course of topical corticosteroid, or nocturnal patching. Cauterization of the redundant folds is sometimes effective. Alternatively, the clinician may consider excision of excess conjunctival tissue with primary closure to relieve the chronic ocular irritation and, in some cases, the epiphora. Tissue adhesive may facilitate wound closure without the need for sutures. Amniotic tissue grafting and conjunctival fixation are alternative surgical procedures. See Chapter&#160;13 for further discussion of surgical management.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Recurrent Corneal Erosion</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Recurrent erosions typically occur either in eyes that have suffered a sudden, sharp, abrading corneal injury (eg, from a fingernail, paper cut, tree branch), in patients with a history of herpetic keratitis, or in those with preexisting epithelial basement membrane dystrophy or other dystrophy involving the epithelial basement membrane complex. The superficial injury produces an epithelial abrasion that heals rapidly, frequently leaving no clinical evidence of damage. After an interval ranging from days to years, symptoms suddenly recur without any obvious precipitating event. Symptoms subside spontaneously in most cases, only to recur periodically. In contrast to shearing injuries, small, superficial lacerating injuries involving the cornea rarely result in recurrent erosions.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Poor adhesion of the corneal epithelium is thought to be caused by underlying abnormalities in the epithelial basement membrane complex. The precise nature of these abnormalities has yet to be fully determined.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Recurrent corneal erosions are characterized by the sudden onset of eye pain, usually during the night or upon first awakening, accompanied by redness, photophobia, and tearing. Individual episodes may vary in severity and duration. Minor episodes usually last from 30&#160;minutes to several hours; typically, the cornea has an intact epithelial surface at the time of examination. More severe episodes may last for several days and are often associated with greater pain, eyelid edema, decreased vision, and extreme photophobia. Many patients seem to experience ocular discomfort that is out of proportion to the degree of observable pathology. However, slit-lamp examination using retroillumination frequently reveals subtle corneal abnormalities (eg, epithelial cysts). The corneal epithelium is loosely attached to the underlying basement membrane and Bowman layer, both at the time of a recurrent attack and between attacks, when the cornea appears to be entirely healed. During an acute attack, the epithelium in the involved area often appears heaped up and edematous. Although no frank epithelial defect may be present, significant pooling of fluorescein around the affected area is often visible.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A key to distinguishing between posttraumatic erosion and dystrophic erosion in a patient who has no clear-cut history of superficial trauma is careful examination of the contralateral eye following maximal pupillary dilation. Occasionally, subtle areas of loosely adherent corneal epithelium can be identified by applying gentle pressure with a surgical sponge following instillation of topical anesthetic. The presence of basement membrane changes in the <span class="italic">unaffected</span> eye implicates a primary basement membrane defect in the pathogenesis, whereas the absence of such findings suggests a posttraumatic etiology. Other clinical conditions with associated abnormalities of the epithelial basement membrane include diabetes mellitus and dystrophies of the stroma and Bowman layer (see also the discussion on corneal dystrophies in Chapter&#160;7).</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Traditional therapy for the acute phase of this condition consists of frequent lubrication or patching with antibiotic ointments and cycloplegia, followed by use of nonpreserved lubricants or hypertonic saline solution (5% sodium chloride) during the day and ointment at bedtime for at least 6&#160;weeks to facilitate epithelial attachment. Hypertonic agents provide lubrication and may transiently produce an osmotic gradient, drawing fluid from the epithelium and theoretically promoting the adherence of epithelial cells to the underlying tissue. Some patients find hypertonic medications unacceptably irritating, but many others do quite well with this therapy indefinitely. Low-dose oral doxycycline and short-term use of topical corticosteroids have been shown to be very efficacious. The mode of action is thought to be localized inhibition of MMPs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although use of a bandage contact lens may be helpful, proper patient education and judicious monitoring are crucial to a successful outcome. The ideal bandage lens fits without excessive movement and has high oxygen transmissibility (Dk). New-&#173;generation soft contact lenses with lens-&#173;surface treatments that decrease bacterial adherence may offer a better safety profile than older lens designs. Concomitant use of a topical broad-&#173;spectrum antibiotic 2–4&#160;times daily may reduce the possibility of secondary infection but increase the risk of toxicity and bacterial resistance over the long term. Some cornea specialists prefer not to prescribe topical antibiotics for a patient using a bandage contact lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When consistent conservative management fails to control the symptoms, surgical therapy may be indicated. Surgical management of recurrent corneal erosion includes epithelial debridement and anterior stromal puncture. Some clinicians prefer to use debridement for central erosions or erosions related to corneal dystrophy, and stromal puncture in patients with posttraumatic recurrent erosions. An alternative to these procedures is excimer laser ablation either with phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) or photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Trichiasis and Distichiasis</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Trichiasis</span> is an acquired condition in which eyelashes emerging from their normal anterior origin curve inward toward the cornea. It can be idiopathic or secondary to chronic inflammatory conditions such as mucous membrane pemphigoid, Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome, blepharitis, or chemical burns. Most cases are probably the result of subtle cicatricial entropion of the eyelid margin.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Distichiasis</span> is a congenital (often autosomal dominant) or acquired condition in which an extra row of eyelashes emerges from the ducts of meibomian glands. These eyelashes can be fine and well tolerated or coarser and a threat to corneal integrity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aberrant eyelashes and poor eyelid position and movement should be corrected. Aberrant eyelashes may be removed by mechanical epilation, electrolysis with a radiofrequency probe, or cryotherapy. Mechanical epilation is temporary because the eyelashes normally grow back in as few as 3&#160;weeks. Electrolysis works well for removing only a few eyelashes; however, it may be preferable in younger patients for cosmetic reasons. Cryotherapy is still a common treatment for aberrant eyelashes, but freezing can result in eyelid margin thinning, loss of skin pigmentation, loss of adjacent normal eyelashes, and persistent lanugo (hairs), which may continue to abrade the cornea. Treatment at –20°C should be limited to less than 30&#160;seconds to minimize complications. The preferred surgical technique for aberrant eyelashes due to marginal cicatricial entropion is tarsotomy with eyelid margin rotation. See BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> for additional discussion of trichiasis and cicatricial entropion.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Factitious Ocular Surface Disorders</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top9">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Factitious disorders include a spectrum of self-&#173;induced injuries with symptoms or physical findings. Factitious conjunctivitis usually shows evidence of mechanical injury to the inferior and nasal quadrants of the cornea and conjunctiva. The areas of involvement show sharply delineated borders. The conjunctival tissues usually show no evidence of inflammation on pathologic examination.</p>
			<p class="h2">Mucus-Fishing Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mucus-fishing syndrome is characterized by a well-&#173;circumscribed pattern of rose bengal or lissamine green staining on the nasal and inferior bulbar conjunctiva. All patients have a history of increased mucus production as a nonspecific response to ocular surface damage. The inciting event is typically keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Patients usually demonstrate vigorous eye rubbing and compulsive removal of strands of mucus from the fornix (mucus fishing). The resultant epithelial injury heightens the ocular surface irritation, which in turn stimulates additional mucus production, resulting in a vicious cycle.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Topical Anesthetic Abuse</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinical application of topical anesthetics has become an integral part of the modern practice of ophthalmology. However, indiscriminate use of topical anesthetics can cause serious ocular surface toxicity and complications. Local anesthetics are known to inhibit epithelial cell migration and division. Loss of microvilli, reduction of desmosomes and other intercellular contacts, and swelling of mitochondria and lysosomes have been reported in ultrastructural studies. The characteristic clinical feature of anesthetic abuse is failure of the presenting condition, for example, corneal abrasion or keratitis, to respond to appropriate therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Initially, a punctate keratopathy is seen. As the abuse continues, the eye becomes more injected and epithelial defects appear or take on a neurotrophic appearance. As the process continues, keratic precipitates and hypopyon develop, thus mimicking an infectious course. Diffuse stromal edema, dense stromal infiltrates, and a large ring opacity are common presenting signs (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-5</span>). Stromal vascularization may occur in chronic abuse, and secondary infection may ensue. Because of the presence of corneal infiltrates and anterior segment inflammation, infectious keratitis and corneal scraping, culture, or biopsy should be considered.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis includes bacterial, fungal, herpetic, and amebic keratitis. Suspicion of anesthetic abuse should be raised in any patient with negative culture results who does not respond to appropriate therapy. A trial of patching in suspected cases, with the patch appropriately labeled to detect removal, may be therapeutic as well as diagnostic. Often, the condition is diagnosed only when the patient is discovered concealing the anesthetic drops. Once the diagnosis is made and the offending anesthetics are removed, corneal healing usually ensues. In advanced cases, permanent corneal scarring or perforation may occur. Psychiatric counseling is sometimes helpful. Health care workers and others with access to topical anesthetics may be more likely to abuse these agents.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Toxic Reactions to Topical Ophthalmic Medications</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top10">
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Toxic ocular surface disease can occur as a complication of exposure to various substances (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;4-2</span>). Epithelial keratopathy secondary to use of topical ophthalmic medications can result in a dose-&#173;dependent cytotoxic effect on the ocular surface. One of the most toxic ingredients in these preparations is the preservative, usually BAK. The corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells absorb and retain preservatives, with residual amounts of preservative being detectable in the corneal epithelium days after a single application of a topical preserved medication.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Punctate staining of the corneal or conjunctival epithelium, erosive changes, and subepithelial corneal infiltrates are all indicative of direct toxicity. Conjunctival injection, a follicular response, mild to severe papillary reaction, and mucopurulent discharge may be seen. Occasionally, the discharge may be copious and mimic bacterial conjunctivitis. Infrequently, a monocular reaction occurs despite the medication being applied to both eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">More severe cases of toxic keratitis can present with a diffuse punctate epitheliopathy, occasionally in a whorl pattern called <span class="italic">vortex</span> or <span class="italic">hurricane keratopathy</span>. The most severe cases may present with a corneal epithelial defect of the inferior or central cornea, stromal opacification, and neovascularization and may be associated with extensive damage to the limbal stem cells. A sign of limbal stem cell deficiency is effacement of the palisades of Vogt, which can be seen with prolonged use of preserved topical medications or agents that block fibrin formation (eg, mitomycin&#160;C). Mitomycin&#160;C, even when used with care, has been associated with prolonged, irreversible stem cell damage with a resultant chronic keratopathy. Localized application of mitomycin (applied only to the surgical site) using a cellulose surgical sponge, as in trabeculectomy or pterygium excision, followed by copious irrigation is believed to reduce the risk of limbal stem cell damage and is, therefore, the preferred approach.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Toxic keratitis manifesting as peripheral corneal infiltrates in the epithelium and anterior stroma, with a clear zone between the lesions and the limbus, is typically associated with aminoglycoside antibiotics, antiviral agents, or medications preserved with BAK or thimerosal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chronic follicular conjunctivitis generally involves both the upper and the lower palpebral conjunctivae but is usually most prominent inferiorly. Bulbar follicles are uncommon but, when present, are highly suggestive of a toxic etiology (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-6</span>). The medications most commonly associated with toxic follicular conjunctivitis include atropine, antiviral agents, miotics, sulfonamides, epinephrine (including dipivefrin), <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-adrenergic agonists (eg, apraclonidine, brimonidine tartrate), and vasoconstrictors. Inferior punctate epithelial erosions may occasionally accompany toxic follicular conjunctivitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Contact lens solutions can also cause severe epithelial damage and pain when contact lenses soaked in cleaning or preservative-&#173;laden solutions are inadvertently placed in the eye without rinsing. The alkaline cleaning material or preservative (often thimerosal) can cause chemical injury of the cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Asymptomatic subconjunctival fibrosis is sometimes associated with the long-term use of topical ophthalmic drugs (eg, miotics); however, in a small minority of affected patients, a more severe type of progressive subconjunctival scarring develops, which can lead to contraction of the conjunctival fornix, symblepharon formation, punctal stenosis, and corneal pannus formation. This entity is called <span class="italic">drug-&#173;induced cicatricial pemphigoid.</span></p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Treatment of ocular toxicity requires that the offending topical medications be discontinued. Severe cases may take months to resolve completely; thus, failure of symptoms and signs to resolve within a period of days to a few weeks is not inconsistent with a toxic etiology. Patients who are experiencing significant ocular irritation may find relief with nonpreserved topical lubricant drops or ointment. It is important to stress that toxic reactions to ocular medications can lead to irreversible changes, for example, conjunctival scarring and/or shrinkage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Drug-induced pemphigoid should be confirmed with a conjunctival biopsy, which often (but not always) demonstrates the characteristic diffuse, nonlinear immunofluorescent staining indicative of antibody deposition. Withdrawal of the medication is generally followed by a lag of weeks before progressive scarring can be stabilized (see Chapter&#160;11).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Dellen</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top11">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dellen are saucerlike depressions in the corneal surface due to focal stromal dehydration. Desiccation of the corneal epithelium and subepithelial tissues occurs at or near the limbus, adjacent to conjunctival surface elevations such as those produced after recession–<br />resection surgery or in the presence of large filtration blebs. Normal blinking does not wet the involved area properly because the tear film is interrupted by these surface elevations. Patching followed by frequent topical lubrication is most effective in rapidly restoring stromal hydration, although resolution of conjunctival chemosis or bleb revision may be necessary for permanent resolution of dellen.</p>
                </div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency</p>
            <div id="Chapt4_Top12">
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ocular surface comprises populations of epithelial cells, which are replaced throughout life via proliferation of a distinct subpopulation of cells known as <span class="italic">stem cells.</span> Corneal stem cells are located in the basal cell layer of the limbus, whereas conjunctival stem cells may be uniformly distributed throughout the bulbar surface or located in the fornices. Stem cells have an unlimited capacity for self-&#173;renewal and are slow cycling (ie, they have low mitotic activity). Once stem cell differentiation begins, it is irreversible. The process of differentiation occurs by means of transit amplification. Transit-&#173;amplifying cells, which have a limited capacity for self-&#173;renewal, can be found at the limbus as well as at the basal layer of the corneal epithelium. Each of these cells is able to undergo a finite number of cell divisions. Corneal and conjunctival stem cells can be identified only by indirect means, such as clonal expansion and identification of slow cycling.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Approximately 25%–33% of the limbus must be intact to ensure normal ocular resurfacing. The normal limbus acts as a barrier against corneal vascularization from the conjunctiva and invasion of conjunctival cells from the bulbar surface.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> When the limbal stem cells are congenitally absent, injured, or destroyed, conjunctival cells migrate onto the ocular surface, often accompanied by surface irregularity and superficial neovascularization. The absence of limbal stem cells reduces the effectiveness of epithelial wound healing, as evidenced by compromised ocular surface integrity with an irregular ocular surface and recurrent epithelial breakdown.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Stem cell deficiency states result from both primary and secondary causes. Primary causes include <span class="italic">PAX6</span> gene mutations (aniridia), ectodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–clefting syndrome, sclerocornea, keratitis-&#173;ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome, and congenital erythrokeratodermia. Secondary causes include chemical burns, thermal burns, radiation, contact lens wear, ocular surgery, immune-&#173;based mucous membrane conjunctivitis (eg, mucous membrane pemphigoid, Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome), mucous membrane conjunctivitis related to infection (eg, trachoma), pterygia, long-term use of topical medications (pilocarpine, β-&#173;blockers, antibiotics, antimetabolites), and dysplastic or neoplastic lesions of the limbus.</p>
                <p class="body-text">See <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;4-3</span> for an etiologic classification of limbal stem cell deficiency.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Clinically, stem cell deficiency of the cornea can be found in several ocular surface disorders. Affected patients usually have recurrent ulceration and decreased vision as a result of the irregular corneal surface. Corneal neovascularization is invariably present in the involved cornea. A whorl-like irregularity of the ocular surface emanating from the limbus can be more easily observed following the instillation of topical fluorescein (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-7</span>).</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> In mild or focal cases associated with local factors such as contact lens use or topical medications, any possible inciting cause should be discontinued. In these cases, treatment with topical corticosteroids is advocated by some clinicians. If the stem cell deficiency is sectoral and mild, the abnormal epithelium can be debrided, allowing for resurfacing of the denuded area with cells derived from the remaining intact limbal epithelium.</p>
                <p class="body-text">In more extensive or severe cases of limbal stem cell deficiency, initial therapy with a scleral contact lens may be helpful. If this is not effective, replacement of stem cells by limbal transplantation is an alternative. When the limbus is focally affected in 1&#160;eye (eg, pterygium), a limbal or conjunctival autograft can be harvested from the same eye. For unilateral, moderate or severe chemical injuries, a limbal autograft can be obtained from the healthy fellow eye. For bilateral limbal deficiency, as with Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome or bilateral chemical burns, a limbal allograft from a human leukocyte antigen–matched living related donor (or, if unavailable, an eye bank donor eye) can be considered; however, systemic immunosuppression is required following limbal allograft transplantation (see the discussion of ocular surface surgery in Chapter&#160;13). Another alternative in cases of severe limbal cell deficiency is a keratoprosthesis (see Chapter&#160;15).</p>
