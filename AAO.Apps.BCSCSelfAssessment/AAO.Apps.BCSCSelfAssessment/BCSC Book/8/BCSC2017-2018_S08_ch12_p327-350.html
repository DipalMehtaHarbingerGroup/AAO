			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the United States, approximately 1&#160;person in 2500&#160;seeks ophthalmic care for a tumor of the eyelid or ocular surface each year, or about 100,000&#160;per year. Benign neoplasms of the eyelid and ocular surface are at least 3&#160;times more common than malignant lesions. Most of these tumors arise from the eyelid skin; they are discussed in BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> and Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Tumors of the conjunctiva and cornea are considered together because the lesions can affect both tissues concurrently. These lesions are classified by cell type: epithelium, melanocytes and nevus cells, vascular endothelium, mesenchymal cells, and lymphocytes. Many are analogous to lesions affecting the eyelid.</p>

			<p class="h1">Approach to the Patient With a Neoplastic Ocular Surface Lesion</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">During the initial evaluation of a patient with a conjunctival or corneal neoplasm, the clinician should obtain a detailed history, including extensive sun exposure, skin cancer, or immunosuppression. The clinician should inquire about the length of time the patient has had the lesion and whether there has been any change in the lesion’s appearance. The racial or ethnic background of the patient is relevant, as conjunctival pigmentation may be normal in some patients (eg, darker-&#173;skinned persons) but worrisome in others.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A complete eye examination, including a dilated fundus examination, should be performed during the initial evaluation of the patient with a suspicious ocular surface lesion. The entire ocular surface should be examined, including the superior fornix, which requires eyelid eversion. Palpation for lymphadenopathy in the neck and preauricular region is an important part of the examination of tumor patients—especially when malignancy is suspected—because malignant lesions, especially conjunctival melanoma, can spread to regional lymph nodes. The clinical characteristics of the lesion should be noted, with the following considered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Is there a single lesion, or is it multifocal?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Is the lesion pigmented or amelanotic?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Where is it located—on the bulbar conjunctiva, at the limbus, in the fornix, on the palpebral conjunctiva?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Does the lesion extend onto the cornea?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Is the lesion solid or cystic?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Is it flat or elevated?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Is the lesion fixed to underlying tissues, or is it mobile?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">Is there a feeder vessel?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician should document the appearance and extent of the lesion, using either photographs or a detailed diagram. This aids in surgical planning if the lesion is to be removed or in following the lesion if observation is recommended.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Management of Patients With Ocular Surface Tumors</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An experienced clinician often has an opinion about the nature of a conjunctival or corneal lesion after completing the history and physical examination. Many lesions are not worrisome for malignancy (eg, inclusion cysts); others will be indeterminate based on the history and results of the clinical examination. For these cases, observation may be a reasonable option. If observation is elected, regular ophthalmic examinations are essential. If growth or worrisome changes in the characteristics of the lesion are documented, surgery or topical chemotherapy is usually indicated. Tissue for histologic evaluation may be required for definitive diagnosis. Lesions that cause concern for possible malignancy</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">are elevated</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">are extensive, pigmented, even if flat</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">are fixed to underlying tissues</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">have a large feeder vessel</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The next 2&#160;sections, Surgical Treatment and Topical Chemotherapy, provide a paradigm for/general approach to the management of suspicious conjunctival and corneal neoplasms. Following these sections, the various types of ocular surface neoplastic disorders are discussed and additional comments on management are provided for specific lesions as appropriate.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Surgical Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The standard surgical treatment of a suspicious conjunctival lesion is complete removal of the tumor, including a 2-mm margin of uninvolved tissue surrounding the lesion, when possible. The surgeon attempts to avoid touching the tumor during removal (“no touch” technique) in order to prevent inadvertent seeding of the remaining conjunctiva with tumor cells. Incisional biopsies should be avoided for the same reason, especially in pigmented lesions of the conjunctiva. Involvement of the corneal epithelium is managed with absolute alcohol–assisted epithelial curettage with a surgical blade or blunt-edged instrument such as a Kimura spatula; the surgeon takes care to avoid violating the Bowman layer, which is a natural barrier to tumor extension into the corneal stroma. Some lesions may require lamellar sclerectomy for complete removal. Cryotherapy at the time of ocular surface surgery has been shown to improve the prognosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once the tumor is removed, additional manipulations should be performed with clean surgical instruments to reduce the risk of tumor seeding. Primary conjunctival closure or a conjunctival autograft may be considered if the conjunctival defect is small. Ocular surface reconstruction with amniotic membrane transplantation is useful in the management of conjunctival lesions and allows for wider tumor margins with less risk of postoperative scarring. Amniotic membrane also facilitates reepithelialization and reduces postoperative inflammation. The graft should be cut slightly larger than the defect and may be attached with fibrin tissue adhesive. If tissue adhesive is not available, either absorbable (9-0 or 10-0 polyglactin) or nonabsorbable (10-0 nylon) suture may be used to fixate the graft. If more than two-thirds of the limbal epithelium is removed, chronic epitheliopathy may result. Stem cell transplantation using tissue harvested from the fellow eye of the patient or an allograft may eventually be required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once removed from the ocular surface, the lesion can be placed on filter paper and the edges labeled with ink or suture to indicate the orientation of the lesion and facilitate histologic diagnosis. The surgeon should take care to avoid damage to the specimen during removal, as any damage could make the lesion more difficult to interpret. The clinical history is relevant to the pathologist’s interpretation of the lesion; thus, the label should include the following information: the age and race or ethnicity of the patient, the duration of the lesion, and whether the lesion has changed clinically. Diagnosis of conjunctival tumors can&#160;be challenging, especially for general pathologists. If possible, a conjunctival tumor should be evaluated by an ophthalmic pathologist. Immunostaining can help in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for further discussion of specimen handling and histologic examination of various ocular surface tumors.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Topical Chemotherapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topical chemotherapy may be used as an alternative to surgical excision for primary treatment of ocular surface tumors or as adjunctive therapy preceding or following surgical excision. Some authors advocate using topical treatment prior to surgical removal, the purpose being to reduce the size of large ocular surface tumors. Topical chemotherapy has the advantage of treating beyond areas of clinically visible involvement, but unlike surgical excision, it does not lead to histologic diagnosis or enable determination of clear margins. Further, since the appearance of some tumors is similar (eg, amelanotic conjunctival melanoma may resemble squamous cell carcinoma), there is concern that if chemotherapy is elected and the tumor does not respond, valuable time in the management of a potentially deadly lesion may have been lost.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Options for first-line therapy for squamous lesions are topical interferon-<span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2b</span> or topical mitomycin&#160;C (MMC), or wide-&#173;margin surgical excision with cryotherapy (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;12-1, 12-2</span>). Interferon-<span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2b</span> is used most often as it has fewer adverse effects than MMC (ocular surface toxicity and potential stem cell deficiency); however, MMC can be used for a shorter duration—typically weeks rather than months—and may be more effective for melanocytic tumors. The antineoplastic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is less commonly used but may be considered for squamous lesions if other agents are unaffordable, ineffective, or poorly tolerated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The optimal topical chemotherapy regimen has not been determined in controlled studies. Topical interferon-<span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2b</span> 1&#160;million IU/mL is typically given 4&#160;times daily until clinical resolution, usually within 2 to 4&#160;months. It is not unusual for tumors to appear unresponsive during the first 3&#160;months of treatment and then show abrupt regression. In fact, several additional months of treatment may be beneficial, given recent evidence, obtained with ultrahigh-&#173;resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT), that residual tumor may be present for up to 3&#160;months following clinical resolution. Subconjunctival/perilesional injection of interferon-<span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2b</span> (3&#160;million IU in 0.5&#160;mL) can be given weekly in addition to, or as an alternative to, topical drops, especially if patient adherence is an issue. Subconjunctival interferon-<span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2b</span> is associated with flulike symptoms in 10% of patients. Topical MMC 0.02% or 0.04%, because of its potential toxicity, is typically administered 4&#160;times daily for 1&#160;week, followed by a 1-week structured treatment interruption (drug holiday), for a maximum of 3 or 4&#160;treatment cycles. If residual tumor persists, alternative treatment should be considered to avoid potential MMC toxicity. 5-Fluorouracil 1% may be given 4&#160;times daily for 1&#160;month, with a structured treatment interruption of at least several months if treatment is repeated; alternatively, it may be given 4&#160;times daily for 1&#160;week, followed by a 3-week structured treatment interruption, until resolution (maximum of 3&#160;treatment cycles). Application of topical corticosteroids may help with the surface toxicity. Placement of punctal plugs reduces the likelihood of systemic absorption and helps prevent punctal stenosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once a tumor has been managed, long-term, regular follow-&#173;up is essential because malignant conjunctival tumors can recur. Complete examination of the ocular surface and palpation of regional lymph nodes should be performed at each visit. Patients with malignant ocular surface tumors should be referred to a dermatologist for a complete skin evaluation.</p>

			<p class="h2">Benign Epithelial Tumors</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Conjunctival papilloma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">There are 2&#160;forms of conjunctival papilloma, sessile and pedunculated, and they differ etiologically, histologically, and clinically. See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for discussion of the histologic findings.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> <span class="italic">Human papillomavirus (HPV),</span> subtypes&#160;6 and 11 (in children) or 16 (in adults), initiates a neoplastic growth of epithelial cells with vascular proliferation that gives rise to a pedunculated papilloma of the conjunctiva. A sessile conjunctival lesion, though also usually benign, may represent a dysplastic or carcinomatous lesion, especially when caused by HPV subtypes&#160;16, 18, or 33.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> A pedunculated conjunctival papilloma is a fleshy, exophytic growth with a fibrovascular core (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-3A</span>). It often arises in the inferior fornix but can also present on the tarsal or bulbar conjunctiva or along the plica semilunaris. The lesion emanates from a stalk and has a multilobulated appearance with smooth, clear epithelium and numerous underlying small corkscrew blood vessels. Multiple lesions sometimes occur, and the lesion may be extensive in patients with compromised immunity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A sessile papilloma is typically found at the limbus and has a flat base (Fig&#160;12-3B). With its glistening surface and numerous red dots, this form of papilloma resembles a strawberry. The lesion may spread onto the cornea. Signs of dysplasia include leukoplakia (indicative of keratinization), symblepharon formation, inflammation, and invasion. A very rare variant is an inverted papilloma.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> A pedunculated papilloma that is small, cosmetically acceptable, and nonirritating may be observed. Spontaneous resolution can occur over many months to years. Surgical excision with cryotherapy or cautery to the base of the lesion is curative in approximately 90% of cases. An incomplete excision, however, can stimulate growth and lead to a worse cosmetic outcome. Surgical manipulation should be minimized to reduce the risk of dissemination of the virus to uninvolved healthy conjunctiva. Adjunctive treatment with topical interferon-<span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2b</span> or oral cimetidine may be of benefit for extensive or recalcitrant lesions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A sessile limbal papilloma must be observed closely or excised. If the lesion enlarges or shows clinical features suggesting dysplastic or carcinomatous growth, excisional biopsy with adjunctive cryotherapy is indicated.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN)</span> is an inclusive term used to describe a wide spectrum of conjunctival and corneal squamous tumors that may have similar clinical findings and require biopsy to differentiate. The traditional categorization of OSSN lesions as conjunctival or corneal intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is defined by histologic criteria. See also BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors.</span></p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Ultraviolet light exposure, aging, HPV infection, smoking, fair complexion, and immunosuppression play a role in the development of OSSN. Rapid growth may occur when the lesion is present in a person with AIDS. Systemic immunosuppression seems to potentiate squamous neoplasia. In a young adult, OSSN should prompt consideration of a serologic test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Noninvasive OSSN: conjunctival or corneal intraepithelial neoplasia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conjunctival or corneal intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), or <span class="italic">dysplasia,</span> is analogous to actinic keratosis of the skin. In CIN, the dysplastic process does not involve the underlying basement membrane. CIN is considered a premalignant condition, at risk of transforming into squamous cell carcinoma. Related terms include <span class="italic">squamous dysplasia, </span>which is used when atypical cells invade only part of the epithelium, and <span class="italic">squamous carcinoma in situ,</span> used when cellular atypia involves the entire thickness of the epithelial layer.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> There are 3&#160;principal clinical variants of conjunctival disease (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-4</span>):</p>

			<p class="numbered-list-last">&#9;3.&#9;leukoplakic, which is caused by hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and dyskeratosis</p>
			<p class="body-text">CIN lesions are slow-&#173;growing tumors that are nearly always centered at the limbus but able to spread to other areas of the ocular surface. Mild inflammation and various degrees of abnormal vascularization may accompany CIN lesions; large feeder blood vessels indicate an increased probability of invasion beneath the epithelial basement membrane.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal involvement may present as a translucent, sometimes granular, gray epithelial sheet that is based at the limbus and extends onto the cornea. The edges of corneal lesions have characteristic fimbriated margins and pseudopodia-&#173;like extensions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-5</span>). Rose bengal and lissamine green staining help define the edges of the lesion. In some cases, the conjunctival or limbal component is not clinically apparent. Occasionally, free islands of corneal involvement are present.</p>
			<p class="h3">Invasive OSSN: squamous cell carcinoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), involvement extends beyond the basement membrane into stroma, with metastatic potential. SCC is more common and aggressive in patients with compromised immunity and in those with xeroderma pigmentosum.</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> A plaquelike, gelatinous, or papilliform growth occurs in limbal and bulbar conjunctiva, usually in the interpalpebral fissure zone. A broad base is often present along the limbus. The lesion tends to grow outward and have sharp borders; it may appear leukoplakic (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-6</span>). Although histologic invasion beneath the epithelial basement membrane is present, growth usually remains superficial, with neoplastic cells infrequently penetrating the sclera or Bowman layer. Pigmentation can occur in dark-skinned patients. Engorged conjunctival vessels suggest malignancy. Note that the clinical appearance of CIN and invasive SCC may be similar (compare Figures&#160;12-4C and&#160;12-6).</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Variants of squamous cell carcinoma</span> <span class="italic">Mucoepidermoid carcinoma</span> is an aggressive variant of SCC that is more likely to invade the globe or orbit. It arises primarily in the salivary glands and rarely occurs in the conjunctiva. In addition to neoplastic epithelial cells, malignant goblet cells can be shown with mucin stains. Treatment is wide surgical excision; adjuvant therapy may include cryotherapy and radiotherapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Spindle cell carcinoma,</span> another variant, is a rare, highly malignant SCC of the bulbar or limbal conjunctiva in which the anaplastic cells appear spindle shaped, like fibroblasts.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Management of OSSN</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All OSSN lesions should be treated as possible carcinoma with metastatic potential because it may be difficult to distinguish dysplasia from invasive squamous cell carcinoma clinically. See Figure&#160;12-1, which summarizes the various treatment options for OSSN, as well as the section Management of Patients With Ocular Surface Tumors, earlier in the chapter. With the benefit of topical chemotherapy and modern surgical techniques, recurrence rates for OSSN range from less than 5% to 15%, compared with historical rates of up to 56%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">SCC can grow into the iris or trabecular meshwork or the orbit, providing a portal to the systemic circulation and metastasis. Orbital invasion may require orbital exenteration. Radiation therapy may be indicated as adjunctive therapy in select cases.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sebaceous gland carcinoma accounts for approximately 1% of all eyelid tumors and 5% of eyelid malignancies. It usually occurs in older individuals but may be seen in younger persons after radiation therapy. These tumors may masquerade as chalazia or as chronic unilateral blepharoconjunctivitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-7</span>). Consequently, more than 50% of cases are initially misdiagnosed. Epithelial invasion of the conjunctiva occurs in almost 50% of cases and extends onto the cornea in more than 25% of cases.

Affected patients may have a diffuse nevus of the uvea, evident as increased pigmentation of the iris and choroid. In approximately 50% of patients with ocular melanocytosis, there is ipsilateral dermal melanocytosis and a proliferation of dermal melanocytes in the periocular skin of the first and second dermatomes of cranial nerve V. The combined ocular and cutaneous pigmentations are referred to as <span class="italic">oculodermal melanocytosis</span> <span class="italic">(nevus of Ota).</span> Approximately 5% of cases are bilateral. <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;12-3</span> compares the various pigmented lesions of the conjunctiva.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In 10% of patients with ocular melanocytosis, secondary glaucoma occurs in the affected eye. Malignant transformation is possible but rare and seems to occur only in patients with fair complexions. Malignant melanoma can develop in the skin, conjunctiva, uvea, or orbit. The lifetime risk of uveal melanoma in a patient with ocular melanocytosis is about 1 in 400—significantly greater than the approximate 6-per-&#173;million risk of the general population.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Nevus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nevocellular nevi of the conjunctiva consist of nests or more diffuse infiltrations of benign melanocytes. They arise during the first or second decade of life. Conjunctival nevi are classified as junctional (confined to the epithelial–stromal junction); subepithelial, or stromal (confined to the stroma); or compound (combines junctional and stromal components). Pure intraepithelial nevi are rare except in children.</p>
			<p class="body-text">On histologic examination, nevi can occasionally be very difficult to differentiate from melanoma. Junctional nevi may be difficult to distinguish from primary acquired melanosis (see the section “Primary acquired melanosis” later in the chapter).</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> A nevus near the limbus is usually almost flat. Nevi appearing elsewhere on the bulbar conjunctiva, plica semilunaris, caruncle, or eyelid margin tend to be elevated. Pigmentation of conjunctival nevi is variable: they may be light tan to brown or amelanotic (15% of cases; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-9</span>). A subepithelial nevus often has a cobblestone appearance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Small epithelial inclusion cysts occur within approximately half of all conjunctival nevi, particularly the compound or subepithelial varieties. Secretion of mucin by goblet cells in the inclusion cysts can cause a nevus to enlarge, giving a false impression of malignant change. Cellular proliferation may induce secondary lymphocytic inflammation. Rapid enlargement can occur at puberty, giving rise to a clinical impression of conjunctival melanoma. An amelanotic, vascularized nevus, when inflamed, may resemble an angioma, or it may be misdiagnosed as chronic conjunctivitis. See Table&#160;12-3 for a clinical comparison of the various pigmented lesions of the conjunctiva.</p>

			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Conjunctival nevi rarely become malignant and can be followed with an examination every 6–12&#160;months that includes serial photography or detailed slit-lamp drawings incorporating dimensional measurements. Excisional biopsy should be performed on lesions that show suspicious change or growth. A biopsy should also be performed for pigmented lesions on the palpebral conjunctiva or cornea or in the fornix, as nevi are rare in these locations.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Complexion-associated melanosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complexion-&#173;associated melanosis (CAM; also called racial melanosis) is more commonly seen in individuals with darker complexions, but it occurs in all races (approximately 95% of blacks, 35% of Asians, 30% of Hispanics, and 5% of whites). CAM appears as flat, light- to dark-brown conjunctival patches with irregular margins that are most apparent at the limbus and less prominent as it extends into the fornix (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-10</span>). The pigmentation can also involve the caruncle and palpebral conjunctiva as well as extend into the cornea with streaks or whorls (striate melanokeratosis). Histologic findings consist of hyperpigmentation of the conjunctival basal epithelial cells without atypia or hyperplasia. CAM is bilateral, fairly symmetric, and benign, with little risk of progression to melanoma. It is important to differentiate CAM from primary acquired melanosis (discussed in the following section), which seldom occurs in individuals with darker skin, is usually unilateral or highly asymmetric, and can transform to melanoma.</p>

			<p class="h3-h2">Primary acquired melanosis</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Primary acquired melanosis (PAM) is an acquired noncystic, flat, patchy or diffuse, tan to brown pigmentation of the conjunctival epithelium. The condition is usually unilateral or asymmetric if bilateral and is most often seen in light-skinned individuals (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-11</span>). Secondary acquired melanosis has a similar appearance but is associated with systemic disease (eg, Addison disease), previous radiation, or pregnancy or is secondary to another conjunctival lesion (eg, squamous papilloma or carcinoma). Table&#160;12-3 compares the various pigmented lesions of the conjunctiva.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Changes in the size of PAM may be associated with inflammation or may be the result of hormonal influences. Complete examination of the ocular surface (including double eversion of the upper eyelid) is essential in any patient with conjunctival pigmentation; see the following section for management of these lesions.</p>

			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Most cases of PAM are benign, but a substantial minority of cases may pro&#173;gress to melanoma. It is difficult to predict which lesions may progress, but clinical findings such as larger size (3&#160;clock-hours or more) and caruncular, forniceal, or palpebral location portend a worse prognosis. Two clock-hours or less of conjunctival involvement is associated with a lower risk of malignant transformation; involvement of more than 2&#160;clock-hours is an indication to remove the lesion for histologic diagnosis. Other worrisome signs include progressive enlargement, a nodular component, feeder vessels, and thickening.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most important finding in predicting progression is the presence of cellular atypia, which can be determined only by excisional biopsy. As such, suspicious lesions should be removed and sent for histologic examination and immunohistochemistry. See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for a more detailed discussion of the evolving histologic classification of intraepithelial melanosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As PAM without atypia has little malignant potential, it may be followed (with examination every 6–12&#160;months). PAM with mild atypia has a minimal risk of malignant transformation but should be followed more closely. However, PAM with moderate to severe atypia carriers a significant risk of progression to melanoma; thus, every effort should be made to eliminate all conjunctival pigment in patients with moderate to severe atypia. If the pigmentation is diffuse and not amenable to complete excision, adjuvant topical chemotherapy with mitomycin&#160;C may be useful to treat the entire ocular surface. The surgeon should exercise care in performing intraocular surgery in a patient with untreated ocular surface neoplasia, as violation of the Bowman layer may lead to tumor seeding within the corneal stroma and internal structures of the eye. Secondary acquired melanosis has no significant risk of progression to melanoma.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With a prevalence of approximately 1 per 2&#160;million in the population with European ancestry, conjunctival melanomas make up less than 1% of ocular malignancies in this group. Conjunctival melanomas are rare in black and Asian populations. Although malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva has a better prognosis than cutaneous melanoma, the overall mortality rate is 25%. The ONE Network on the American Academy of Ophthalmology website contains additional information on this topic, including video.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Conjunctival melanomas may arise from PAM (70%) or nevi (5%) or may arise de novo (25%). Intralymphatic spread increases the risk of metastasis. In rare cases, an underlying ciliary body melanoma can extend through the sclera and mimic a conjunctival melanoma.</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Although conjunctival melanomas can arise in palpebral conjunctiva, they are most commonly found in the bulbar conjunctiva or at the limbus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-12A</span>). The degree of pigmentation is variable; approximately 25% of conjunctival melanomas are amelanotic. Recurrent melanomas are often amelanotic, even if the primary tumor was pigmented (Fig&#160;12-12B). Because heavy vascularization is common, these tumors may bleed easily. They grow in a nodular fashion and can invade the globe or orbit. Poor prognostic indicators include</p>

			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Ocular surface lesions worrisome for melanoma should be treated expeditiously using the paradigm described at the beginning of the chapter. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been advocated by some authors but has not been widely adopted. Orbital exenteration is occasionally performed for advanced disease when local excision or enucleation cannot completely excise the tumor (when metastases have been excluded) or as palliative treatment for advanced, aggressive tumors that cannot be controlled locally. The role of adjunctive radiotherapy has not been determined.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Conjunctival melanoma has a high rate of recurrence (more than 50%). Patients with a history of conjunctival melanoma thus require lifelong, close ophthalmic follow-&#173;up and should be counseled to contact their physician immediately should they notice any changes in the involved eye. Conjunctival melanomas are potentially deadly tumors. In one study, metastasis was detected in 26% of patients, and death occurred in 13% of patients 10&#160;years after surgical excision. Melanomas arising de novo (ie, not from preexisting nevi or PAM), tumors not involving the limbus, and residual involvement at the surgical margins are factors associated with an especially poor prognosis.</p>
