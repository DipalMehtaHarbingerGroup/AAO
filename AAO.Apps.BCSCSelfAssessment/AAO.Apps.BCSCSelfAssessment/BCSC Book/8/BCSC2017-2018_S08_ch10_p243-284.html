				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2">In children, the number of bacterial conjunctivitis cases is similar to that of viral conjunctivitis cases, but in adults, 80% of cases of infectious conjunctivitis are viral in origin. </li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Most cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis resolve in 2 to 7&#160;days without treatment. Some prospective studies suggest that delaying treatment until day 3 or 4 would significantly reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics without affecting outcomes. However, treatment may be necessary in cases with persistent or worsening signs.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) practice guidelines recommend that initial cultures be obtained for patients with central, deep stromal, or large (&gt;2&#160;mm) corneal infiltrates and for patients whose history or clinical features suggest fungal, amebic, mycobacterial, or drug-resistant organisms as the causative agents. </li>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Bacteriology </p>
		    <div id="Chapt10_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Bacteria are prokaryotes, organisms in which the genetic material is not separated from the cytoplasm by a nuclear membrane. Most bacterial genes exist as part of a single circular chromosome, but some are present on smaller extrachromosomal circles called <span class="italic">plas</span><span class="italic">mids,</span> which typically determine inheritance of 1 or a few characteristics. Plasmid DNA is passed between bacterial strains and species more easily than is chromosomal DNA and represents an important mechanism in the rapid proliferation of mutations such as antibiotic resistance. </p>
			<p class="body-text">The prokaryote cell wall imparts shape and rigidity to the cell and also mediates interactions with other bacteria, bacterial viruses, and the environment, including therapeutic drugs. Bacteria are broadly characterized by their microscopic shape as either cocci (round) or bacilli (elongated, or rodlike), with some being indeterminate. Bacteria are further characterized as either gram-positive or gram-negative, according to the reaction of the cell wall (blue or red, respectively) to the Gram stain. This characteristic provides critical information on the structure and biochemical composition of the cell wall that can be predictive of the bacteria’s antibiotic susceptibility (<span class="xref-table">Table 10-1</span>). The cell wall of gram-positive bacteria consists of a thick layer of peptidoglycan, the primary target of penicillin, and teichoic acid, whereas the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria is composed of a thin<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>layer that is covered by an external lipopolysaccharide membrane (endotoxin), which excludes certain antibiotics. Some bacteria stain poorly with Gram stain, including <span class="italic">Mycobacteria</span> and <span class="italic">Nocardia asteroides,</span> visualized best with acid-fast stain.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Structures external to the cell wall facilitate bacterial interactions, including <span class="italic">flagella</span> (motility), <span class="italic">pili</span> (bacterial conjugation [transfer of bacterial DNA from one bacterial cell to another]), <span class="italic">fimbriae</span> (bacterial adherence), and <span class="italic">adhesins</span> (mucosal surface adhesion). The rapid replication times of bacteria, combined with plasmid-mediated and chromosome-mediated mutations as well as biofilm formation, favor bacterial survival and make it largely inevitable that bacteria will develop resistance to antibiotics.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Gram-positive Cocci</p>
			<p class="h3-h2"><span class="h3--emph-">Staphylococcus</span> species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Staphylococci inhabit the skin, skin glands, and mucous membranes of healthy mammals. They grow in grapelike clusters in culture but may be seen singly, in pairs, or in short chains in smears from ocular specimens. Staphylococci produce an external biofilm that interferes with phagocytosis and secrete a variety of extracellular proteins—including toxins, enzymes, and enzyme activators—that facilitate both colonization and disease induction. These bacteria adapt quickly and effectively to administered antibacterial agents and may develop resistance to β-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines, and quinolones. Ocular and nonocular infections due to methicillin-resistant <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (MRSA) are an increasing problem, leading to the common use of vancomycin, which continues to provide reliable gram-positive coverage for ocular pathogens. Resistance to vancomycin is emerging, however, requiring the development and introduction of newer drugs.</p>
			<p class="h3"><span class="h3--emph-">Streptococcus</span> species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Streptococci inhabit the mucous membranes of the normal upper respiratory tract and female genital tract (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-1</span>) and grow in pairs and chains. The historical classification of streptococci was based on serologic grouping of their cell wall carbohydrates (Lancefield groups) and their ability to hemolyze blood-containing agar media, which is useful for initial recognition of clinical isolates. These methods are used less often today, given the availability of genetic sequence data.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> appear in smears as lancet-shaped diplococci and express a polysaccharide capsule that resists phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. The toxin pneumolysin is liberated by autolysis and inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, lymphocyte proliferation, and antibody synthesis.</p>
			<p class="h3"><span class="h3--emph-">Enterococcus</span> species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Enterococci, seen in either pairs or short chains, are a common source of antibiotic resistance such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). <span class="italic">Enterococcus faecalis </span><span class="CharOverride-2">is</span> an important cause of endophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Gram-negative Cocci</p>
			<p class="h3-h2"><span class="h3--emph-">Neisseria</span> species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> causes urogenital, rectal, and pharyngeal infections, as well as hyperacute conjunctivitis, and can invade intact corneal epithelium, induce keratolysis of the corneal stroma, and perforate the cornea. <span class="italic">N gonorrhoeae</span> is always a pathogen, whereas the closely related species <span class="italic">Neisseria meningitidis</span> may be commensal in the pharynx without causing disease. <span class="italic">N gonorrhoeae</span> is a bean-shaped, gram-negative diplococcus usually seen within neutrophils on a clinical smear taken from ocular or genital sites (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Gram-positive Rods </p>
			<p class="h3-h2"><span class="h3--emph-">Corynebacterium</span> species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Corynebacterium</span> species are pleomorphic bacilli that display palisading or cuneiform patterns in smears. <span class="italic">Corynebacterium diphtheriae</span> is an exotoxin-producing agent and cause of acute membranous conjunctivitis. Other <span class="italic">Corynebacterium</span> species, referred to as diphtheroids, are routinely isolated from the external eye in the absence of clinical infection. <span class="italic">Corynebacterium xerosis</span> is commonly seen on histologic sections of vitamin A deficiency–associated conjunctival Bitôt spots, but its significance in conjunctival xerosis is unknown.</p>
			<p class="h3"><span class="h3--emph-">Propionibacterium</span> species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes</span> and related species are normal inhabitants of human skin. They are aerotolerant but prefer an anaerobic environment. These slender, slightly curved gram-positive rods sometimes have a beaded appearance (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-3</span>). <span class="italic">P acnes</span> is a major cause of chronic postoperative endophthalmitis and can cause microbial keratitis.  </p>
			<p class="h3"><span class="h3--emph-">Bacillus</span> species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Bacillus</span> species are ubiquitous gram-positive or gram-variable rods commonly found in soil and characterized by the production of spores, a form of the bacteria that allows survival for extended periods under extremely harsh conditions. <span class="italic">Bacillus</span> species are typically motile, and this feature may play a role in the explosive character of <span class="italic">Bacillus cereus</span>–<br />induced posttraumatic endophthalmitis. <span class="italic">B cereus</span> produces a number of toxins that may rapidly damage ocular tissues. The closely related genus <span class="italic">Clostridium</span> is anaerobic; <span class="italic">Bacillus</span> species are aerobes or facultative anaerobes.</p>
			<p class="h2">Gram-negative Rods</p>
			<p class="h3-h2"><span class="CharOverride-1">Pseudomonas</span> species </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> comprises slender gram-negative rods (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-4</span>) commonly found as contaminants of water. <span class="italic">P aeruginosa</span> ocular infections are among the most fulminant. Permanent tissue damage and scarring are the rule following corneal infection. Structural virulence factors of <span class="italic">P aeruginosa</span> include polar flagella, adhesins, and surface pili. <span class="italic">P aeruginosa</span> organisms secrete a number of toxins that disrupt protein synthesis and damage cell membranes of ocular cells, as well as proteases that degrade the corneal stromal extracellular matrix.</p>
			<p class="h3">Enterobacteriaceae</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The family Enterobacteriaceae includes multiple genera of enteric non–spore-forming gram-negative rods, including <span class="italic">Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, Salmonella, Shigella,</span> and <span class="italic">Proteus.</span> In particular, the genera <span class="italic">Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia,</span> and <span class="italic">Proteus</span> include species that are important causes of keratitis. Pathogenetic factors include pili, adhesins, cytolysins, and toxins. Enteropathogenic <span class="italic">Escherichia coli</span> expresses a protein similar to cholera toxin.</p>
			<p class="h3"><span class="h3--emph-">Haemophilus</span> species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Haemophilus</span> species vary in morphology from oval (coccobacilli) to short rods. Culture isolation requires enriched media such as chocolate agar. Along with streptococci, <span class="italic">Haemophilus</span> species are important etiologic agents of bleb infections following glaucoma filtering surgery. <span class="italic">Haemophilus influenzae</span> can be divided into biotypes based on biochemical reactions; capsulated strains are further divided into serotypes based on their capsular polysaccharides. <span class="italic">H influenzae</span> type b (Hib) is the primary human pathogen, and its capsule is a major virulence factor.</p>
			<p class="h3"><span class="h3--emph-">Bartonella henselae</span></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Bartonella henselae,</span> the etiologic agent of cat-scratch disease, is a gram-negative aerobic rod best seen with Warthin-Starry staining of a biopsy specimen. <span class="italic">B henselae</span> infection can be confirmed by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunocytologic staining (of histologic specimens), and serologic testing. Cats, especially young cats, are a natural reservoir of <span class="italic">B henselae,</span> and despite the disease’s association with a history of cat scratch or contact with fleas, infection may be transmitted by any contact with an infected cat. (See Parinaud Oculoglandular Syndrome later in the chapter.)</p>
			<p class="h2">Gram-positive Filaments</p>
			<p class="h3-h2"><span class="h3--emph-">Mycobacterium</span> species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mycobacteria are nonmotile, aerobic, weakly gram-positive, but acid-fast; in smears, they appear as straight or slightly curved rods. Löwenstein-Jensen medium is most commonly used for culture isolation. Mycobacteria are obligate intracellular pathogens and are divided into 2 main groups based on their growth rate. <span class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> and <span class="italic">My</span><span class="italic">cobacterium leprae</span> are slow growers. Ocular infection by <span class="italic">M tuberculosis</span> is uncommon, but it can manifest as a scleritis or posterior uveitis. The fast-growing atypical mycobacteria, including <span class="italic">Mycobacterium fortuitum</span> and <span class="italic">Mycobacterium cheloneae,</span> are a more common cause of ulcerative keratitis in the setting of an immunocompromised ocular surface or refractive surgery. Although their importance as a cause of keratitis following refractive surgery remains, atypical mycobacteria have been supplanted by MRSA as the predominant causative agent in this setting.</p>
			<p class="h3"><span class="h3--emph-">Nocardia</span> species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Nocardia asteroides</span> and related filamentous bacilli are gram-variable or gram-positive, weakly acid-fast bacteria. They may cause keratitis that is clinically similar to one caused by the atypical mycobacteria.</p>
			<p class="h3"><span class="h3--emph-">Actinomyces</span> species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Actinomycetes are gram-positive, non–acid-fast anaerobic bacteria that colonize the mouth, intestines, and genital tract. They are an important cause of canaliculitis.</p>
			<p class="h2"><span class="h2--emph-">Chlamydia</span> Species  </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chlamydiae are spherical or ovoid obligate intracellular parasites of mucosal epithelium with a dimorphic life cycle. The infectious form is the <span class="italic">elementary body (EB),</span> which develops within an infected host eukaryotic cell into the intracellular replicating form, the <span class="italic">reticulate body (RB).</span> Only the EB survives outside the host, and only the EB is infectious. Reticulate bodies divide by binary fission to produce 1 or more EBs within a cytoplasmic vacuole, seen on light microscopy as a cellular inclusion.</p>
			<p class="h3"><span class="h3--emph- CharOverride-3">Borrelia burgdorferi </span></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Borrelia</span> species are obligate parasites, best visualized with Giemsa stain. <span class="italic">B burgdorferi,</span> the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted to humans by the deer tick. The clinical manifestations of Lyme disease are divided into 3 stages, with the most characteristic feature of stage 1 (local disease) being a macular rash, known as erythema chronicum migrans. The pathogenic factors of <span class="italic">B burgdorferi</span> include the expression of proteinases that facilitate tissue invasion, the induction of proinflammatory cytokines upon binding to phagocytes, and the activation of the complement cascade. Although the organism can be cultured from biopsy specimens taken from erythema migrans skin lesions, the diagnosis of Lyme disease is determined by the results of serologic testing and typical clinical findings. See BCSC Section 1, <span class="italic">Update on General Medicine,</span> and Section 9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis, </span>for further discussion.</p>

			<p class="h1">Mycology </p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fungi are eukaryotes that develop branching filaments. Their cell walls are rigid and contain chitin and polysaccharides. Fungi are classically divided into 2 groups: <span class="italic">yeasts,</span> round or oval fungi that reproduce by budding and sometimes form pseudohyphae by elongation during budding; and <span class="italic">molds,</span> multicellular fungi composed of tubular hyphae, either septate or nonseptate, that grow by branching and apical extension (<span class="xref-table">Table 10-2</span>). Yeasts may also form hyphae under certain circumstances. The branching hyphae of molds can form a <span class="italic">mycelium,</span> an interconnected network of hyphae. <span class="italic">Septate fungi</span> are distinguished by the presence of walls that divide the filaments into separate cells, each containing one or more nuclei (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-5</span>). <span class="italic">Dimorphic fungi</span> grow in 2 distinct forms as a result of changes in cell wall synthesis in different environments and may often constitute highly virulent pathogens. Fungal cell walls stain with Gomori methenamine silver but, except for <span class="italic">Candida,</span> do not take up Gram stain. Classification of filamentous fungi is based on microscopic features of <span class="italic">conidia</span> (fungal elements that form asexually) and <span class="italic">conidiophores</span> (the specialized hyphae where conidia are formed). However, the histologic morphology of fungi varies significantly when they are isolated from tissue (corneal scraping/biopsy); fungi thus require laboratory isolation for definitive identification. Most antifungal medications target the fungal cell wall either through direct toxicity or interference with cell wall synthesis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Yeasts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The incidence of mycotic infections has increased significantly with the rise of immunosuppressed states, both disease related and pharmacologically induced, as well as with the increase in long-term antibacterial use by immunocompromised patients and the general population. <span class="italic">Candida</span> species are ubiquitous in the environment and are ordinarily resident flora of, and recoverable from, the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, the oropharynx, and the skin (with <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> being the most common species at these sites; <span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-6</span>). Yeast is a disproportionate cause of fungal keratitis in cooler northern climes. The pathogenesis of this yeast in the cornea is enhanced by the formation of pseudohyphae, which express proteases and phospholipases, facilitating tissue penetration.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> infection is acquired through inhalation and causes clinical disease in the brain and optic nerve, eye, lung, skin, and prostate in immunosuppressed patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Rhinosporidium seeberi</span> is present in soil and groundwater and presumably infects humans through contact with these sources. Ocular rhinosporidiosis manifests as sessile or pedunculated papillomatous or polypoid lesions in the conjunctiva, which may be associated with similar lesions in the nose and nasopharynx.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Molds</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Septate filamentous fungi</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vast majority of external ocular mold infections are caused by septate fungi. <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> species (eg, <span class="italic">Fusarium solani</span> and <span class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum</span>) are common pathogens encountered in warm, humid environments as a cause of fulminant keratitis. Among the genera that have been isolated from the external eye are <span class="italic">Aspergillus, Alternaria, Curvularia, Paecilomyces, Scedosporium,</span> and <span class="italic">Phialophora.</span> Most cases of oculomycosis occur following trauma with soil or vegetable matter and, less frequently, with contact lens usage.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Nonseptate filamentous fungi</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nonseptate filamentous fungi include the <span class="italic">Mucor, Rhizopus,</span> and <span class="italic">Absidia</span> species in class Zygomycetes, order Mucorales, family Mucoraceae. These ubiquitous fungi are an uncommon cause of external ocular infections. They can also cause life-threatening infections of the paranasal sinuses, brain, and orbit in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with diabetes mellitus.  </p>

Identification of <span class="italic">P insidiosum</span> is very difficult because of clinicians’ unfamiliarity with this pathogen and because identification is based solely on morphology and evolving PCR techniques. Cure of associated keratitis is achieved mainly through early suspicion, recognition, and keratoplasty, with most keratitis cases progressing to either enucleation or evisceration, although reports of successful medical therapy have emerged. </p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Protozoa</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> species are protozoa (unicellular eukaryotes) that can cause an isolated infection of the human cornea as their primary disease in humans. Other conditions have been described, such as disseminated dermatitis, visceral infestation, and encephalitis unrelated to ocular disease. The <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> life cycle includes a motile trophozoite form (15–45 µm in diameter) and a dormant cyst form (10–25 µm in diameter) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-7</span>). The cysts are double-walled and very hardy, resistant to most environmental extremes and toxins, including chlorine. Classification of <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> species has been based on morphology, but molecular methods are more accurate and increasingly utilized.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Microsporidia</span> are obligate intracellular parasites and, recently, have also been linked to the Fungi kingdom. Of the phylum Microspora, the following genera have been implicated in human infection: <span class="italic">Nosema, Encephalitozoon, Pleistophora, Vittaforma</span>, <span class="italic">Trachipleistophora, Enterocytozoon,</span> and unclassified microsporida. </p>
			<p class="h3"><span class="CharOverride-1">Leishmania</span> species </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="CharOverride-4">Leishmania</span> is a genus of flagellate protozoa. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of its vector, the female sandfly, in endemic areas of tropical Asia, Africa, and Latin America. An infected eyelid ulcer may become granulomatous. Scrapings or biopsy material obtained from the ulcer can show intracellular parasites by Giemsa or immunofluorescent stains. The parasites can sometimes be isolated on blood agar or insect tissue culture medium. </p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Helminths</p>
			<p class="Default">Onchocerciasis is caused by onchocercal filariae transmitted by the bite of the blackfly (genus<span class="italic"> Simulium</span>), which lays its eggs on vegetation in fast-flowing rivers (hence the common name for the disease, <span class="italic">river blindness</span>) and is endemic in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Microfilariae penetrate the skin and mature in subcutaneous nodules formed at the site of the bite for approximately 1&#160;year, after which mating produces microfilariae offspring (≈300 µm in length)—up to 1500 a day per female (100&#160;cm in length). These worms can live as long as 15&#160;years in the human host; thus, diagnosis can be made with skin snips demonstrating the microfilariae.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Migration of microfilariae to the skin and eye results in clinical onchocerciasis, and subsequent blackfly bites can carry the organism to other individuals. Microfilariae enter the peripheral cornea, where they can be visualized by slit-lamp examination, and may reach the inner eye. Keratitis (including punctate keratitis and “snowflake” and sclerosing peripheral corneal opacities), anterior uveitis, and chorioretinitis occur upon death of the microfilariae. The intense, blinding inflammatory keratitis has been shown to be a reaction less to the microfilariae than to a bacterial endosymbiont, <span class="italic">Wolbachia,</span> which is essential to filariae reproduction. Antifilarial therapy can produce a systemic inflammatory response, but prior treatment with systemic doxycycline has been shown to reduce this response. Treatment by nodulectomy or with oral ivermectin (the discoverers of which were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2015) and control of local blackfly populations have been successful in reducing the incidence of onchocerciasis in selected areas. </p>

This condition is not purely infectious, however; antimicrobial therapy is rarely curative because of a significant inflammatory component that may predispose to bacterial overgrowth and perpetuate a local immune deviation.

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Demodex</span> is a genus of mites that are normal commensal acarian parasites of humans. On slit-lamp biomicroscopy, their presence is suggested as waxy “sleeves” around eyelashes (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-10</span>) or as “cylinders” extending from sebaceous glands of the eyelid margin. The role of these parasites in the pathogenesis of blepharitis is unclear, but some patients may experience an inflammatory response with infestation. The infestation may respond to diluted tea tree oil applied to the base of the eyelashes. Other organisms that survive on lipids of eyelid glands, such as <span class="italic">Malassezia furfur,</span> have also been implicated in certain types of blepharitis.</p>

In rare instances, pediculosis involves the ocular region by localized extension of head or body lice (<span class="italic">Pediculus humanus capitis</span> or <span class="italic">Pediculus humanus corporis,</span> respectively). Mechanical removal of the lice and nits (eggs) can be performed with jeweler’s forceps, but pubic hairs are usually treated with a pediculicide. Any ointment can smother the lice and should be applied twice daily for at least 10&#160;days, because the incubation period (of the nits) is 7–10&#160;days. Periodic reexamination is recommended over 10–14&#160;days to detect recurrence and remove any new nits. Bed linen, clothing, and any items of close contact should be washed and dried at the highest temperature setting (at least 50°C). </p>
                <p class="h2">Bacterial Conjunctivitis in Children and Adults  </p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Overall, 80% of cases of infectious conjunctivitis in adults are viral in origin. While, in children, the number of bacterial conjunctivitis cases is similar to that of viral conjunctivitis cases, bacterial conjunctivitis is much less common than viral conjunctivitis in adults.  </p>
                <p class="body-text">Bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by bacterial overgrowth and infiltration of the conjunctival epithelial layer and sometimes the substantia propria. The source of infection is either direct contact with an infected individual’s secretions (usually through eye–hand contact) or the spread of infection from the organisms colonizing the patient’s own nasal and sinus mucosa. In an adult with unilateral bacterial conjunctivitis, the nasolacrimal system should be examined, as nasolacrimal duct obstruction, dacryocystitis, or canaliculitis may be the underlying cause.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Though usually self-limited, bacterial conjunctivitis can occasionally be severe and sight-threatening when caused by virulent bacterial species such as <span class="italic">N gonorrhoeae</span> or <span class="italic">Streptococcus pyogenes.</span> In rare cases, it may presage life-threatening systemic disease, as with conjunctivitis caused by <span class="italic">N meningitidis.</span> </p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Bacterial conjunctivitis should be suspected in patients with conjunctival inflammation and a purulent discharge. The rapidity of onset and severity of conjunctival inflammation and discharge are suggestive of the possible causative organism. <span class="xref-table">Table 10-3</span> outlines the clinical classification of bacterial conjunctivitis based on these parameters.</p>
                <p class="h3">Acute purulent conjunctivitis </p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Acute purulent conjunctivitis is a self-limited infection of the conjunctiva characterized by an acute inflammatory response with purulent discharge of less than 3&#160;weeks’ duration (definition of <span class="italic">acute</span>). Cases may occur spontaneously or in epidemics. The most common etiologic pathogens are <span class="italic">S pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, H influenzae,</span> and <span class="italic">S aureus,</span> with the relative frequency of each varying depending on patient age and geographic location.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> <span class="italic">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> conjunctivitis is characterized by a moderate purulent discharge, eyelid edema, chemosis, conjunctival hemorrhages, and occasional inflammatory membranes on the tarsal conjunctiva. Corneal ulceration occurs in rare instances.</p>
                <p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Haemophilus influenzae</span> conjunctivitis occurs in young children, sometimes in association with otitis media, and in adults, particularly those chronically colonized with <span class="italic">H&#160;influenzae</span> (eg, smokers or patients with chronic bronchopulmonary disease). Acute purulent conjunctivitis caused by <span class="italic">H influenzae</span> biotype III (formerly <span class="italic">Haemophilus aegyptius</span>) resembles that caused by <span class="italic">S pneumoniae</span>; however, conjunctival membranes do not develop, and peripheral corneal epithelial ulcers and stromal infiltrates occur more commonly. <span class="italic">H influenzae</span> preseptal cellulitis may be associated with fulminant <span class="italic">Haemophilus</span> meningitis, in which up to 20% of patients who recover have long-term neurologic sequelae. The incidence of infection has been reduced by a vigorous program of vaccination against Hib. </p>
                <p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> may produce an acute blepharoconjunctivitis. The discharge tends to be somewhat less purulent than that seen in pneumococcal conjunctivitis, and the associated signs are generally less severe.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Gram-stained smears and culture of the conjunctiva are usually not necessary in uncomplicated, largely self-limited cases of suspected bacterial conjunctivitis but should be used for the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-11">certain compromised hosts, such as neonates or debilitated or immunocompromised individuals, to assess the risk of local and systemic complications</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-mid">severe cases of purulent conjunctivitis, to differentiate it from hyperpurulent conjunctivitis, which generally requires systemic therapy</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-last-nosp">cases unresponsive to initial therapy</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Most cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis resolve in 2–7&#160;days without treatment. Some prospective studies suggest that delaying treatment until day 3 or 4 would significantly reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics without affecting outcomes. Initiating treatment at this time only for persistent or worsening signs would generally shorten the course and improve symptoms. If the conjunctivitis is improving on day 4, antibiotics may not be necessary at all, as these studies also indicate that initiation of antibiotics after day&#160;4 provides limited benefit. Cases likely to represent a viral conjunctivitis should <span class="italic">not</span> be routinely treated with empiric antibiotics.</p>
                <p class="body-text">When the physician believes that further intervention is indicated, the initial treatment should be weighted toward the results of the Gram-stained morphology of the bacteria identified on the conjunctival smear. Definitive treatment should be based on the culture results, if available, as smear results may sometimes be inconclusive as to the predominant category of organism responsible for the infection. Cultures of the nose or throat may be obtained if an associated sinusitis or pharyngitis is present. Even if no overt sinusitis, rhinitis, or pharyngitis is present, nasal or throat swabs should be considered in cases of relapsing conjunctivitis, because organisms persisting in and colonizing the respiratory tract mucosa may be the source of infection.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Empiric therapy with polymyxin B-trimethoprim, aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone drops, or bacitracin or ciprofloxacin ointment can be initiated before results of the Gram stain or culture have been received. The dosing schedule is 4–6&#160;times daily for approximately 5–7&#160;days unless otherwise indicated. Cases with gram-negative coccobacilli on Gram-stained smears are probably caused by <span class="italic">Haemophilus</span> species and should be treated with polymyxin B-trimethoprim. Supplemental oral antibiotics are recommended for patients with acute purulent conjunctivitis associated with pharyngitis, for those with conjunctivitis-otitis syndrome, and for children with <span class="italic">Haemophilus</span> conjunctivitis.</p>
                <p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Hyperacute gonococcal conjunctivitis </p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Gonococcal conjunctivitis presents with explosive onset and very rapid progression of severe purulent conjunctivitis: massive exudation; severe chemosis; eyelid edema; marked conjunctival hyperemia; and, in untreated cases, corneal infiltrates, melting, and perforation. The organism most commonly responsible for hyperpurulent conjunctivitis is <span class="italic">N gonorrhoeae</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-11</span>). Gonococcal conjunctivitis is a sexually transmitted disease resulting from direct transmission of the organism, for example, from the genitalia to the hands and then to the eyes or from the mother to the neonate during vaginal delivery. </p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Gonococcal conjunctivitis is one of the few bacterial diseases associated with preauricular lymphadenopathy and the formation of conjunctival membranes. Keratitis, the principal cause of sight-threatening complications, has been reported to occur in 15%–40% of cases. Corneal involvement may consist of diffuse epithelial haze, epithelial defects, marginal infiltrates, and ulcerative keratitis that can rapidly progress to perforation.</p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> <span class="italic">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span> grows well on chocolate agar and Thayer-Martin media.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Gonococcal conjunctivitis requires systemic antibiotic therapy, with topical ophthalmic antibiotics used as adjunctive therapy only. Current treatment regimens for gonococcal conjunctivitis reflect the increasing prevalence of <span class="italic">penicillin-resistant N gonorrhoeae (PRNG)</span> in the United States. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is highly effective against PRNG. Patients with gonococcal conjunctivitis without corneal ulceration may be treated on an outpatient basis with 1 intramuscular (IM) ceftriaxone (1 g) injection; patients with corneal ulceration should be admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone (1 g IV every 12&#160;hours) for 3 consecutive days. Patients with penicillin allergy can be given spectinomycin (2 g IM) or oral fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 500&#160;mg or ofloxacin 400&#160;mg orally twice daily for 5&#160;days). When possible, fluoroquinolones should be avoided in children because of potential adverse effects on joint cartilage.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Erythromycin ointment, bacitracin ointment, gentamicin ointment, and ciprofloxacin solution have been recommended for topical therapy. Treatment of severe cases should include copious, frequent (every 30–60&#160;minutes) irrigation of the conjunctival sac with normal saline to remove inflammatory cells, proteases, and debris that may be toxic to the ocular surface and contribute to corneal melting.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Up to one-third of patients with gonococcal conjunctivitis have been reported to have concurrent chlamydial venereal disease. Because of this frequent association, it is advisable to give patients supplemental oral antibiotics for treatment of chlamydial infection. Treatment regimens for chlamydia are discussed later in this chapter. Patients should be instructed to refer their sex partners for evaluation and treatment. Other sexually transmitted pathogens causing conjunctivitis include <span class="CharOverride-4">Chlamydia trachomatis,</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">Treponema pallidum,</span> human immunodeficiency virus, and herpes simplex virus (<span class="xref-table">Table 10-4</span>).

                <p class="h4-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h4-head">Trachoma</span> Trachoma is an infectious disease that occurs in communities with poor hygiene and inadequate sanitation. It affects approximately 150&#160;million individuals worldwide and is the leading cause of preventable blindness. Trachoma is currently endemic in the Middle East and in developing regions around the world. In the United States, it occurs sporadically among American Indians and in mountainous areas of the South. Most infections are transmitted from eye to eye. Transmission may also occur by flies and household fomites, which spread other bacteria as well, causing secondary bacterial infections in patients with trachoma.</p>

                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> The initial symptoms of trachoma include foreign-body sensation, redness, tearing, and mucopurulent discharge. A severe follicular reaction develops, most prominently in the superior tarsal conjunctiva, but sometimes in the superior and inferior fornices, inferior tarsal conjunctiva, semilunar fold, and limbus. In acute trachoma, follicles on the superior tarsus may be obscured by diffuse papillary hypertrophy and inflammatory cell infiltration. Large tarsal follicles in trachoma may become necrotic and eventually heal with significant scarring. Linear or stellate scarring of the superior tarsus <span class="italic">(Arlt line)</span> typically occurs (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-12</span>). Involution and necrosis of follicles may result in limbal depressions known as <span class="italic">Herbert pits</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-13</span>). Corneal findings in trachoma include epithelial keratitis, focal and multifocal peripheral and central stromal infiltrates, and a superficial fibrovascular pannus, which is most prominent in the superior third of the cornea but may extend centrally into the visual axis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-14</span>).</p>
                <p class="body-text">Clinical diagnosis of trachoma requires at least 2 of the following clinical features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet-list-first">follicles on the upper tarsal conjunctiva</li>

                <p class="body-text">The World Health Organization (WHO) devised a simple severity-grading system for trachoma based on the presence or absence of 5 key signs:</p>

                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Current recommendations for treatment of active trachoma are tetracycline 1% ophthalmic ointment, applied twice daily for 2&#160;months, and oral azithromycin 1000&#160;mg, given as a single dose. Although azithromycin is more effective and easier for patient adherence, cost and availability dictate the best therapy. Topical erythromycin, given at the same frequency as topical tetracycline, and oral tetracycline 1.5–2.0 g daily in divided doses for 3&#160;weeks are also effective. Oral erythromycin is recommended for treatment of rare tetracycline-resistant cases. Management of the vision-threatening complications of trachoma may include tear substitutes for dry eye and eyelid surgery for entropion or trichiasis.</p>
                <p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Adult chlamydial conjunctivitis</span> Adult chlamydial conjunctivitis is a sexually transmitted disease often found in conjunction with chlamydial urethritis or cervicitis. It is most prevalent in sexually active adolescents and young adults. Chlamydia is a systemic disease. The eye is usually infected by direct or indirect contact with infected genital secretions, but other modes of transmission may include shared eye cosmetics and inadequately chlorinated swimming pools. Onset of conjunctivitis is typically 1–2&#160;weeks after ocular inoculation and is not as acute as with adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. Often patients may report having had mild symptoms for weeks to months.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> External signs of adult inclusion conjunctivitis include a follicular conjunctival response that is most prominent in the lower palpebral conjunctiva and fornix, scant mucopurulent discharge, and palpable preauricular adenopathy. Follicles in the bulbar conjunctiva and semilunar fold are frequently present, and these are a helpful and specific sign in patients not using topical medications associated with the finding. Unlike with neonatal forms, inflammatory conjunctival membranes do not develop in adult chlamydial keratoconjunctivitis.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Corneal involvement may consist of fine or coarse epithelial infiltrates, occasionally associated with subepithelial infiltrates. The keratitis is more likely to be found in the superior cornea but may also occur centrally and resemble adenoviral keratitis. A micropannus, usually extending less than 3&#160;mm from the superior cornea, may develop.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Left untreated, adult chlamydial conjunctivitis often resolves spontaneously in 6–18&#160;months. Currently, one of the following oral antibiotic regimens is recommended:  </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet-list-first">azithromycin 1000 mg single dose</li>

Infected infants may also have other localized gonococcal infections, including rhinitis and proctitis. Disseminated gonococcal infection with arthritis, meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis resulting in death of the infant is a rare complication.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Because of the developing resistance of <span class="italic">N gonorrhoeae</span> to various antibiotics—including penicillin (PRNG), fluoroquinolones (QRNG), and tetracycline—the currently recommended first-line treatment for neonatal gonococcal conjunctivitis is ceftriaxone. For <span class="italic">nondisseminated</span> infections, a single IM or IV ceftriaxone injection (up to 125&#160;mg or a dose of 25–50&#160;mg/kg) or cefotaxime at a single dose of 100&#160;mg/kg IV or IM is recommended. For <span class="italic">disseminated</span> infection, treatment should be augmented according to consultation with a specialist in infectious diseases. Either of these regimens should be combined with hourly saline irrigation of the conjunctiva until discharge is eliminated. If corneal involvement is suspected, application of topical erythromycin or gentamicin ointment or frequent application of a topical fluoroquinolone should be considered. Topical cycloplegia may also prove beneficial. Systemic treatment is advised for infants born to mothers with active gonorrhea, even in the absence of conjunctivitis.</p>

                <p class="h3-h2">Contact lens–related infectious keratitis</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the United States, the most frequent risk factor for bacterial keratitis is contact lens wear, which has been identified in 19%–42% of patients with culture-proven microbial keratitis and accounts for up to one-third of emergency department visits for corneal infection. Epidemiologic studies in Australia have estimated the annual incidence of cosmetic contact lens–related ulcerative keratitis at 0.21% for individuals using extended-wear soft lenses and 0.02% for patients using daily-wear soft lenses; this incidence is unaltered by the use of newer lens materials or variation in hygiene practices. The risk of corneal infection is increased nearly tenfold in contact lens wearers; it is even higher in patients who wear their contact lenses overnight, and it is positively correlated with the number of consecutive days that lenses are worn without removal.</p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-18"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Contact lens wear predisposes the cornea to infection through a number of mechanisms, including introduction of a contaminated foreign body to the corneal surface; interruption of the normal tear flow, which is essential to corneal immunity; induction of corneal epithelial microtrauma; alteration of ocular surface immunity; and induction of corneal hypoxia. Various hygiene-related factors increase the risk of both infectious and noninfectious corneal inflammatory events. See BCSC Section 3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics,</span> for further discussion of noninfectious contact lens–related disease.</p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-18"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Eliciting a history of contact lens wear is critical in the evaluation of corneal inflammation, and a history of lens wear should raise the suspicion of corneal infection. Bacteria are both the most common pathogen and the most immediate threat to vision. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, initial management should provide coverage for the most common bacterial pathogen in contact lens–related keratitis, <span class="italic">P aeruginosa,</span> as is done in empiric therapy for bacterial keratitis unrelated to contact lens wear. <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> and fungal pathogens should be suspected if the clinical presentation or clinical course is atypical. </p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Bacterial infection of the eye is a common sight-threatening condition. Some cases have explosive onset and rapidly progressive stromal inflammation. Untreated, it often leads to progressive tissue destruction with corneal perforation or extension of infection to adjacent tissue. Bacterial keratitis is frequently associated with risk factors that disturb the corneal epithelial integrity. Common predisposing factors include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-20">contact lens wear (see the section “Contact lens–related infectious keratitis”) </li>

                    <li class="bullet-list-last-nosp">altered structure of the corneal surface</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Although bacterial keratitis restricted to the epithelial layer only has been reported, corneal pathogens generally must first adhere to the cornea and then invade and proliferate in the corneal stroma. Certain risk factors will often select for specific pathogens, based on their particular mechanism of adherence. For example, <span class="italic">P ae</span><span class="italic">ruginosa</span> becomes more pathogenic in lens-related biofilms, in turn enabling enhanced binding to molecular receptors exposed on injured epithelial cells. Once adherent, bacteria will proliferate and invade the corneal stroma, often with the aid of bacteria-specific proteases. Reactive host inflammation begins with the expression of various cytokines and chemokines, recruitment of inflammatory cells from the tears and limbal vessels, and subsequent secretion of matrix metalloproteinases leading to characteristic corneal necrosis. Reduction of bacterial loads and, potentially, direct control of the inflammatory response may reduce keratolysis. See BCSC Section 1, <span class="italic">Update on General Medicine,</span> for further discussion of bacteriology.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Rapid onset of pain is accompanied by conjunctival injection, photophobia, and decreased vision in patients with bacterial corneal ulcers. The rate of progression of these symptoms depends on the virulence of the infecting organism. Bacterial corneal ulcers are typically a single infiltrate and show a sharp epithelial demarcation with underlying dense, suppurative stromal inflammation that has indistinct edges and is surrounded by edema. <span class="italic">P aeruginosa</span> typically causes stromal necrosis with a shaggy surface and adherent mucopurulent exudate (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-15</span>). An endothelial inflammatory plaque, marked anterior chamber reaction, and hypopyon frequently occur.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Patients with infections caused by slow-growing, fastidious organisms such as mycobacteria or anaerobes may have a nonsuppurative infiltrate and intact epithelium. <span class="italic">Infectious crystalline keratopathy,</span> for example, presents as densely packed, white, branching aggregates of organisms in the virtual absence of a host inflammatory response, shielded by the bacterial biofilm coating. Risk factors include corticosteroid use, contact lens wear, and previous corneal surgery. Infectious crystalline keratopathy has been reported with a number of bacterial and fungal species, most commonly α-hemolytic <span class="italic">Streptococcus</span> species (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-16</span>).</p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-18"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> The prevalence of a particular causative organism depends on the geographic location and risk factors for the infection. Causative organisms in bacterial keratitis are listed in <span class="xref-table">Table 10-5</span>.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Studies indicate that for bacterial keratitis, clinical appearance of the infection is an unreliable guide in determining the causative pathogen. The successful use of topical fluoroquinolones in the 1990s led to a reduction in the number of cultures performed for cases of presumed infectious keratitis. The American Academy of Ophthalmology practice guidelines continue to recommend that initial cultures be obtained for infiltrates extending to the middle of the cornea, into deep stroma, or across a large area (&gt;2&#160;mm), as well as for patients whose history or clinical features suggest fungal, amebic, mycobacterial, or drug-resistant organisms as the causative agents. In addition to corneal culture, it may be helpful to culture contact lenses, contact lens cases and solutions, and any other potential sources of contamination, such as inflamed eyelids. Some correlation has been shown between cultures of such sources and corneal scrapings.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The yield for corneal cultures and smears is significantly higher before the initiation of antibiotic treatment, but cases unresponsive to such therapy should still be cultured, with some suggesting discontinuation of antibiotics for 12–24&#160;hours to encourage yield. However, a positive smear result at any point does not obviate the need for broad-spectrum coverage, although it may cause coverage to be weighted toward a different class of microorganism and/or provide guidance for later treatment in the absence of a positive culture. (See <span class="xref-local">Chapter 9</span> in this volume and BCSC Section 4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for discussion of specimen collection, culturing, staining, and interpretation.)</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> In any keratitis, the primary goal of therapy is preservation of sight and corneal clarity. Bacterial pathogens can produce irreversible corneal scarring over a period of hours because of their rapid growth, keratolytic enzymes, and stimulation of destructive host immune responses. Therefore, therapy must be initiated before definitive diagnosis is obtained in order to rapidly reduce the bacterial load and minimize later visual disability. </p>
                <p class="body-text">Initial therapy consists of empiric, broad-spectrum topical antibiotics. In routine corneal ulcers, monotherapy with topical fluoroquinolones provides outcomes equivalent to those of combination therapy, because of the excellent penetration achieved with commercially available concentrations of fluoroquinolones. These antibiotics should initially be given every 30–60&#160;minutes and then tapered in frequency according to the clinical response. In severe cases, administration of antibiotics every 5&#160;minutes for 30&#160;minutes as a loading dose can more rapidly achieve therapeutic concentrations in the corneal stroma. Second-generation fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin) continue to have excellent <span class="italic">Pseudomonas</span> coverage but lack useful gram-positive activity. Third- and fourth-generation fluoroquinolones (eg, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and besifloxacin) have improved gram-positive and atypical mycobacterial coverage but limited activity against MRSA.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Alternatively, topical combination therapy with an agent active against gram-positive bacteria and another agent active against gram-negative bacteria can be used as initial therapy (<span class="xref-table">Table 10-6</span>). Although “fortified” antibiotics (compounded at increased concentrations compared with their commercial formulations in order to achieve therapeutic levels in the corneal stroma) are more difficult to obtain and may have a greater toxic effect on the ocular surface, the clinician should consider using them, especially in combination with vancomycin for gram-positive coverage when MRSA is suspected, with large or vision-threatening ulcers, or with prior antibiotic failure. Effectively treated, most infectious keratitis is culture negative after 48–72&#160;hours. Once the offending microbe is identified or the clinical response shows improvement, appropriate monotherapy may be considered (see <span class="xref-table-local">Table 10-6</span>) to maintain coverage and reduce toxicity. However, laboratory sensitivities are based on antibiotic tissue levels achievable by systemic administration, and the levels achieved by topical administration are much higher. Often, a bacterial keratitis will respond in vivo even when in vitro data suggest resistance. Any changes in medical therapy should therefore be based primarily on clinical response. Several clinical parameters are useful for monitoring clinical response to antibiotic therapy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-11">blunting of the perimeter of the stromal infiltrate</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-mid">decreased density of the stromal infiltrate</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-mid">reduction of stromal edema and endothelial inflammatory plaque</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-mid">reduction in anterior chamber inflammation</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-mid">reepithelialization</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-12">cessation of corneal thinning</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="body-text">Systemic antibiotics—especially the fluoroquinolones, which have excellent ocular penetration—and intensive topical antibiotics are indicated in cases with suspected scleral and/or intraocular extension of infection. </p>
                <p class="body-text">The role of corticosteroid therapy for bacterial keratitis remains controversial. Tissue destruction results from a combination of the direct effects of the bacteria and an exuberant host inflammatory response consisting of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and proteolytic enzymes, which predominate even after corneal sterilization. Corticosteroids are effective at modifying this response, but they also inhibit the host response to infection. The literature strongly suggests that corticosteroid therapy administered <span class="italic">prior to</span> appropriate antibiotic therapy worsens prognosis. The literature is inconclusive, though, about steroid therapy used concomitantly with antibiotic therapy or after it is initiated, as demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial in which topical corticosteroids were given 48&#160;hours after initiation of topical antibiotics for bacterial keratitis. At 3 months, no effect on final visual outcome or complication rate was seen, but a trend toward improved outcomes was noted in those patients with the worst initial vision who received corticosteroids and for the corticosteroid group at 1-year follow-up. Notably in this study, <span class="CharOverride-4">Nocardia</span> keratitis, which is uncommon in the United States, fared worse with corticosteroid treatment. </p>
                <p class="body-text">The indiscriminate or universal use of corticosteroids is, therefore, unsupported but does not appear to increase the general risk of poor outcomes or complications in treated bacterial keratitis. In fact, certain patients may benefit from the addition of corticosteroids to antibiotic therapy. Future study of the appropriate timing and dosage may further refine the indications for corticosteroid use. As there is still significant risk associated with corticosteroid use in patients with bacterial or other forms of infectious keratitis not appropriately treated, following are recommended criteria for instituting corticosteroid therapy for bacterial keratitis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet-list-first">Corticosteroids should not be used in the absence of appropriate antibiotic therapy.</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-mid">The patient must be able to return for frequent follow-up examinations and demonstrate adherence to appropriate antibiotic therapy.</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-last">No other associated virulent or difficult-to-eradicate organism is found or suspected.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="body-text">Corticosteroid drops may be started in moderate dosages (prednisolone acetate or phosphate 1% every 6&#160;hours), and the patient should be monitored at 24 and 48&#160;hours after initiation of therapy. If the patient shows no adverse effects, the frequency of administration may be adjusted based on clinical response. Collagen crosslinking is increasingly used as an adjunctive therapy for bacterial keratitis, with anecdotal success; as this technology becomes more available in the United States, its precise role and application are evolving.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Penetrating keratoplasty (PK) for treatment of bacterial keratitis is indicated if the disease progresses despite therapy, descemetocele formation or perforation occurs, or the keratitis is unresponsive to antimicrobial therapy. The involved area should be identified preoperatively and an attempt made to circumscribe all areas of infection. Peripheral iridectomies are indicated, because seclusion of the pupil may develop from inflammatory pupillary membranes. Interrupted sutures are recommended. The patient should be treated with appropriate antibiotics, cycloplegics, and intense topical corticosteroids postoperatively.

                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Fungal keratitis is less common than bacterial keratitis, generally representing less than 5%–10% of corneal infections in reported clinical series in the United States. Filamentous fungal keratitis occurs more frequently in warmer, more humid parts of the United States than in other regions of the country. Trauma to the cornea with plant or vegetable material is the leading risk factor for fungal keratitis. Contact lens wear has emerged as another risk factor for the development of fungal keratitis. Topical corticosteroids are a major risk factor as well, as they appear to activate and increase the virulence of fungal organisms in part by reducing the cornea’s resistance to infection. <span class="italic">Candida</span> species cause ocular infections in immunocompromised hosts and in corneas with chronic erosions/ulceration from other causes. Systemic corticosteroid and immunosuppressant use in these patients may suppress the host immune response, thereby predisposing to fungal keratitis.

The epidemic occurred in association with the use of Renu with MoistureLoc solution (Bausch + Lomb, Rochester, NY). Bausch + Lomb withdrew the solution from the world market on May 15, 2006, with a subsequent steep decline in <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> cases across the United States.</p>

                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Patients with fungal keratitis tend to have fewer inflammatory signs and symptoms during the initial period than those with bacterial keratitis and may have little or no conjunctival injection upon initial presentation. On the other hand, pain in fungal keratitis can be out of proportion to the relatively uninflamed cornea. Filamentous fungal keratitis frequently manifests as a gray-white, dry-appearing infiltrate that has irregular feathery or filamentous margins (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-18</span>). Superficial lesions may appear gray-white; elevate the surface of the cornea; and have a dry, rough, or gritty texture detectable at the time of diagnostic corneal scraping. Occasionally, multifocal or satellite infiltrates may be present, although these are less common than previously reported. In addition, a deep stromal infiltrate may occur in the presence of an intact epithelium. An endothelial plaque and/or hypopyon may also occur if the fungal infiltrate(s) is sufficiently deep or large or has penetrated into the anterior chamber.</p>
                <p class="body-text">As the keratitis progresses, intense suppuration may develop, and the lesions may resemble those of bacterial keratitis. At this point, rapidly progressive hypopyon and anterior chamber inflammatory membranes may develop. Extension of fungal infection into the anterior chamber is often a cause of rapidly progressive anterior chamber inflammation. Occasionally, fungus may invade the iris or posterior chamber, and angle-closure glaucoma may develop from inflammatory pupillary block.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Yeast keratitis is most frequently caused by <span class="italic">Candida</span> species. This form of fungal keratitis frequently presents with superficial white, raised colonies in a structurally altered eye. Although most cases tend to remain superficial, deep invasion may occur with suppuration resembling keratitis induced by gram-positive bacteria.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> The fungal cell wall stains with Gomori methenamine silver but, except for <span class="italic">Candida,</span> does not take up Gram stain. Blood agar, Sabouraud dextrose agar, and brain–heart infusion agar are the preferred media for fungal culture. Because of progressive enhancements to in vitro antifungal sensitivity testing, these tests are better correlated with clinical outcomes for fungal keratitis and should be pursued. Confocal microscopy is very useful in detecting branching filaments in the cornea, as well as the individual septa found in the majority of corneal mold pathogens.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Natamycin 5% suspension is recommended for the treatment of most cases of filamentous fungal keratitis, particularly those caused by <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> species, which are the most common causative agents for exogenous fungal keratitis occurring in the humid areas of the southern United States. Most clinical and experimental evidence suggests that topical amphotericin B (0.15%–0.30%) is the most efficacious agent available to treat yeast keratitis; most corneal yeast infections respond readily to the drug. Amphotericin&#160;B is also recommended for filamentous keratitis caused by <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> species. Topical voriconazole 1% is increasingly utilized and has been effective in treating some cases of fungal keratitis unresponsive to other therapy; however, significant resistance has been reported, and a recent prospective, randomized clinical trial concluded that this agent is inferior to natamycin for empiric therapy, especially for <span class="CharOverride-4">F solani</span>. </p>
                <p class="body-text">Systemic administration may be considered for treatment of more severe keratitis or keratitis with intracameral extension. The use of older azoles, including ketoconazole (200–600&#160;mg/day), fluconazole (200–400&#160;mg/day), and itraconazole (200&#160;mg/day), for this purpose has been described. Oral voriconazole (200–400&#160;mg/day) and posaconazole (800&#160;mg/day) are rapidly replacing other oral antifungals because of their excellent intraocular penetration and broader spectrum of coverage. Alternatively, intrastromal administration of aqueous-soluble amphotericin B (5–10&#160;µg/0.1 cc) or voriconazole (50–100&#160;µg/0.1 cc) as primary or secondary treatment of deep fungal keratitis, and intracameral injection of either agent for intraocular extension are becoming more widely validated. Unresponsive cases of culture-proven or histologically proven fungal keratitis require definitive speciation of the pathogen as well as antifungal sensitivity testing. As classic morphologic identification is often inaccurate, a look-alike species or <span class="CharOverride-4">P insidiosum</span> (discussed earlier) can be suspected in these cases. Collagen crosslinking has been investigated as an adjunctive therapy for fungal keratitis; it appears to have no role in deeper stromal disease and achieves mixed results in superficial fungal infections.</p>
                <p class="body-text">When the smear result is negative and fungal infection is suspected, repeated scrapings or biopsy may be necessary to identify fungal material. Furthermore, mechanical debridement may be beneficial for cases of superficial fungal keratitis. Fungal infiltration of the deep corneal stroma may not respond to topical antifungal therapy, because the penetration of these agents is reduced in the presence of an intact epithelium. Penetration of natamycin or amphotericin B has been shown to be significantly enhanced by debridement of the corneal epithelium, and animal experiments indicate that frequent topical application (every 5 min) for 1 hour can readily achieve therapeutic levels. Cases with progressive disease despite maximal topical and/or oral antifungal therapy may require therapeutic PK to prevent scleral or intraocular extension of the fungal infection. Both of these latter conditions carry a very poor prognosis for salvaging the eye.</p>

                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> <span class="CharOverride-4">Acanthamoeba</span> is a genus of free-living ubiquitous protozoa found in freshwater and soil. These organisms are resistant to killing by freezing; desiccation; and the levels of chlorine routinely used in municipal water supplies, swimming pools, and hot tubs. They may exist as motile trophozoites or dormant cysts. Initial corneal epithelial adherence is thought to be mediated by a mannose-binding protein, with subsequent stromal invasion promoted by the expression of a mannose-induced protein (MIP-133) and various collagenases. In Western countries, the majority (≈90%) of reported cases of amebic keratitis have been associated with contact lens use, with the remainder associated with various other risk factors. Historically, episodic outbreaks of disease have been associated with water contamination, as for example, homemade saline contact lens solutions that were inappropriately made, groundwater contaminated because of river flooding (United States), or contaminated rooftop cisterns (United Kingdom).</p>
                <p class="body-text">Since 2003, an increased number of <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> cases have occurred in the United States, particularly on the East Coast and in the Midwest. Two initial case-control studies found an association between <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis and the use of Complete MoisturePlus multipurpose cleaning solution (Advanced Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA) for soft contact lens care, resulting in the voluntary recall of the product from the market in May 2007. Unfortunately, the outbreak has persisted, prompting a second multistate case-control study in 2011, led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which, to date, has not identified a definitive source for the outbreak.</p>

                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation</span> Patients with amebic keratitis are classically described as having severe ocular pain; photophobia; and a protracted, progressive course. The disease is bilateral in 7%–11% of patients. Frequently, they have shown no therapeutic response to a variety of topical antimicrobial agents. In early cases, however, <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> infection is localized to the corneal epithelium and may manifest as a mildly symptomatic, diffuse punctate epitheliopathy or dendritic epithelial lesion. Epithelial pseudodendrites are often misdiagnosed as herpetic keratitis and treated with antiviral agents and/or corticosteroids. Stromal infection typically manifests in the central cornea, and early cases have a gray-white superficial, nonsuppurative infiltrate. As the disease progresses, a centered, partial or complete ring infiltrate in the central cornea is frequently observed (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-19</span>). When noted, inflamed corneal nerves, called <span class="italic">radial perineuritis</span> or <span class="italic">radial keratoneuritis,</span> are nearly pathognomonic of amebic keratitis; limbitis, scleritis (focal, nodular, or diffuse), or even dacryoadenitis may be seen as well. Although intraocular extension may occur, consecutive encephalitis has not been reported.</p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Diagnosis of <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis is made by visualizing amebae in stained smears or by culturing organisms obtained from corneal scrapings. However, culture yield is laboratory dependent, with larger studies reporting only 35%–50% positivity for <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba;</span> a significant number of cases are treated based on clinical presentation and/or confocal microscopy findings. Lamellar corneal biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis in some cases. Contact lenses and related paraphernalia can be examined, but amebic contamination is not uncommon, even in patients without disease.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Amebae are seen in smears stained with Giemsa or with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS), calcofluor white, or acridine orange stains. Nonnutrient agar with <span class="italic">E coli</span> or <span class="italic">Enterobacter aerogenes</span> overlay is the preferred medium for culturing amebae, but the organisms also grow well on buffered charcoal–yeast extract agar. Characteristic trails form as the motile trophozoites travel across the surface of the culture plate. In vivo confocal microscopy can also be used to show organisms, particularly the cyst forms (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-20</span>).</p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Early diagnosis of <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis is the most important prognostic indicator of a successful treatment outcome. Diagnostic delay is common, however, because of the nonspecific presentation of the disease and the need for special microbiological diagnostic methods. Clinical features that suggest a diagnosis of <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis rather than herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-20">noncontiguous or multifocal pattern of granular epitheliopathy and subepithelial opacities (unlike the contiguous, dendritic pattern in HSV keratitis)</li>

                </ul>
                <p class="body-text">Cases identified early, defined as epithelial or anterior stromal, have an excellent visual prognosis and generally respond well to epithelial debridement, followed by an extended (3–4-month) course of antiamebic therapy. The presence of deep stromal inflammation, a ring infiltrate, or extracorneal manifestations significantly worsens the prognosis because of the development of stromal scarring and often necessitates longer treatment (up to a year or more), other adjunctive therapy, or therapeutic keratoplasty.</p>
                <p class="body-text">A number of antimicrobial agents have been recommended for medical treatment of <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis based on their in vitro amebicidal effects as well as their clinical effectiveness. Agents used for topical administration include</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-20"><span class="italic">diamidines:</span> propamidine, hexamidine</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">biguanides:</span> polyhexamethylene biguanide (polyhexanide), chlorhexidine</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">aminoglycosides:</span> neomycin, paromomycin</li>
                    <li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-22"><span class="italic">imidazoles/triazoles:</span> voriconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Of these, only the biguanides have been shown to have consistent in vitro and clinical efficacy against both cysts and trophozoites; the others are effective primarily against trophozoites. Therefore, the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment is a biguanide, with a diamidine sometimes used early in the course of therapy, although successful resolution can be achieved with a biguanide alone. A comparison of biguanides did not detect a difference between chlorhexidine 0.02% and polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) 0.02%. Single-agent systemic treatment with voriconazole has been shown to be efficacious in some recalcitrant cases.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Corticosteroid exposure incites acanthamoebal excystment in vitro and may worsen clinical outcomes when used prior to effective antiacanthamoebal therapy. Much of the morbidity of <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis is from the exuberant host response, however, which causes noninfectious corneal and extracorneal complications, including scleritis, glaucoma, and cataracts. The judicious use of topical and systemic immunosuppressants in selected cases is valuable after the patient has been treated for a period of at least 2&#160;weeks.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Traditionally, keratoplasty has been reserved for vision rehabilitation after completion of treatment or for cases that are progressing despite maximal medical therapy and leading to possible perforation. However, recent reports find that with effective antiacanthamoebal agents used as adjunctive therapy, lamellar and penetrating keratoplasty may now have a lower rate of recurrent infection, have a successful visual outcome, and avoid the primary risk factor for graft failure, late inflammatory sequelae, including glaucoma. Medical treatment is preferred, however, in the vast majority of cases. Because late recurrences can occur when medical therapy is stopped before completion, it is advisable to perform any optical keratoplasties only after a full course of amebicidal therapy. Collagen crosslinking is increasingly described as an adjunctive therapy for <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> keratitis; its mechanism of action is unclear, however, and this treatment is unlikely to be beneficial in advanced disease.</p>

Initially recognized as an opportunistic pathogen in individuals with AIDS and those with other forms of immunosuppression, this organism is increasingly reported as the cause of infection in immunocompetent persons in Southeast Asia. </p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h5-head">clinical presentation and evaluation</span> There are 2 distinct clinical presentations of microsporidial infections, depending on the immune status of the patient. In immunocompetent individuals, a corneal stromal keratitis may develop, and in patients with AIDS, conjunctivitis and an epithelial keratopathy may occur (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-21</span>). The latter group may also have disseminated microsporidiosis involving the sinuses, respiratory tract, or gastrointestinal tract.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Patients present with symptoms that include ocular irritation, photophobia, decreased vision, and bilateral conjunctival injection with little or no associated inflammation. Stromal keratitis is caused by agents of the genus <span class="italic">Nosema</span>, whereas the genera <span class="italic">Encephalitozoon</span> and <span class="italic">Septata </span>have been associated with keratoconjunctivitis. In the keratoconjunctivitis variant, corneal findings include superficial nonstaining opacities described as “mucoid” in appearance, along with dense areas of fine punctate fluorescein staining.

In severe cases of <span class="italic">Vittaforma corneae </span>(formerly <span class="italic">Nosema corneum</span>) infection, granulomatous inflammation may lead to necrotic thinning and perforation. PK may then become the only available treatment for severe stromal thinning. In general, medical regimens require long-term use, and recurrence is common after treatment discontinuation. More recent cases have been reported to be self-limited or responsive to a wide array of commercially available topical ophthalmic antibiotics.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infection with <span class="italic">Loa loa</span> (loiasis) and other filarial nematodes can cause conjunctivitis; these infections also have dermatologic manifestations. After the bite of an infected vector, such parasites can burrow subcutaneously to reach the eye area. The microfilarial stage is transmitted from human to human by the bite of an infected female deer fly (genus <span class="italic">Chrysops</span>) indigenous to West and Central Africa. A migrating worm moves under the skin at about 1&#160;cm/min but is most conspicuous when it is seen or felt wriggling under the periocular skin or bulbar conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-24</span>). Extraction of the filarial worm cures the conjunctivitis; antiparasitic treatment for disseminated infestation follows. Diethylcarbamazine is generally given 2&#160;mg/kg 3&#160;times a day for 3&#160;weeks and repeated as necessary. Ivermectin 150&#160;mg/kg may also be effective, but significant adverse effects have been reported in patients with prominent intravascular loiasis. Concurrent administration of corticosteroids and/or antihistamines may be necessary to minimize allergic reactions.</p>
                <p class="h2">Microbial Scleritis  </p>
                <p class="h5-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h5-head">pathogenesis</span> Bacterial and fungal infections of the sclera are very rare. Most cases result from the extension of microbial keratitis involving the peripheral cornea. Trauma and contaminated foreign bodies (including scleral buckles) are possible risk factors. Bacterial scleritis has also occurred in sclera damaged by previous pterygium surgery, especially when beta irradiation or mitomycin has been used (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-25</span>). Bacteria and fungi can also invade tissue of the eye wall surrounding a scleral surgical wound, but endophthalmitis is more likely in this setting. Scleral inflammation can also be a feature of syphilis, tuberculosis, or leprosy, or infection with <span class="italic">Acanthamoeba</span> species, <span class="italic">Nocardia</span> species, or atypical mycobacteria. Tuberculous scleritis should be considered in chronic steroid-dependent scleritis or in the setting of surgically induced necrotizing scleritis (SINS). Diffuse or nodular scleritis is an occasional complication of varicella-zoster virus eye disease.</p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">laboratory evaluation</span> Evaluating suppurative scleritis is similar to evaluating microbial keratitis. Smears and cultures are obtained before antimicrobial therapy is begun. If the overlying epithelium is intact, a scleral or episcleral biopsy should be performed to obtain specimens for culture, histologic examination, and molecular diagnostic testing. The workup of nonsuppurative scleritis is guided by the history and findings from the physical examination, as described in <span class="xref-local">Chapter 11</span>. </p>
                <p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">management</span> Topical antimicrobial therapy is begun just as for microbial keratitis. Because of the difficulty in controlling microbial scleritis, subconjunctival injections and intravenous antibiotics may also be used. Long-term oral therapy shows promise.</p>
