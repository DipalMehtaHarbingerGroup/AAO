			<p class="h2-h1">Pterygium Excision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A pterygium is a wing-shaped pannus of conjunctiva and fibrovascular tissue on the superficial cornea (see Chapter&#160;6). Indications for pterygium excision include ocular discomfort, decreased vision secondary to scarring or visually significant astigmatism, cosmesis, growth of the pterygium over the cornea toward the visual axis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-1</span>), and restricted ocular motility. The goal in pterygium excision is to achieve a clear and topographically smooth ocular surface. After excision, the most commonly used technique for coverage of exposed sclera is an autologous free graft from the same or fellow eye. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis using topical anesthesia, although in some cases, such as a recurrent pterygium complicated by excessive proliferation of the Tenon layer, peribulbar or retrobulbar anesthesia may be required.</p>
			<p class="h3">Surgical technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A traction suture (eg, 6-0 silk or polyglactin on a spatulated needle, placed at the 12-o’clock position, that can be clamped down in various positions to the surgical drape) facilitates maximal exposure of both the pterygium for excision and the superior conjunctival graft site if a conjunctival transplant is planned. A common surgical technique is to remove the pterygium from the cornea by using a flat or angled crescent blade and dissecting a smooth tissue plane toward the limbus, between the pterygium and the underlying corneal tissue (ideally leaving the Bowman layer intact). Although it is preferable to dissect down to bare sclera at the limbus, the surgeon should be careful when dissecting Tenon tissue posteriorly, as doing so can sometimes lead to bleeding and later scarring from inadvertent trauma to subjacent medial rectus muscle tissue and muscle check ligaments.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After excision, light cautery is usually applied to the sclera for hemostasis. It is important to remove as much as possible of the fibrovascular scar tissue in the Tenon layer, down to bare sclera, because residual Tenon tissue is a template for recurrence of the pterygium. If the medial rectus muscle is involved, it should be isolated and carefully freed of all scar tissue. A smooth scleral surface at the site of dissection is a desirable endpoint. Leaving the sclera bare is associated with a higher recurrence rate (32%–88%; <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;13-2</span>). It also increases the occurrence of postoperative pain, perforation, and pyogenic granuloma, as well as corneal complications such as dellen and vascularization. There are many techniques for coverage of bare sclera: a conjunctival flap from contiguous tissue, a free conjunctival graft from the same or fellow eye, application of amniotic membrane using fibrin glue or sutures, and simple limbal epithelial transplantation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Conjunctival autografting and other techniques for coverage of bare sclera</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If there is only a small area of bare sclera after ptyergium excision, many surgeons use a sliding flap technique. This is performed by undermining contiguous conjunctival tissue and rotating it in place without tension. If there is a larger defect, conjunctival autograft transplantation using tissue from the superior bulbar conjunctiva is optimal. With a surgical pen, the area to be harvested is marked 0.5–1.0&#160;mm larger than the size of the defect to account for some later retraction of the graft. It is essential to procure a flap of thin conjunctival tissue with only minimal or no Tenon tissue, which is facilitated by injecting a small amount of anesthetic (lidocaine 1% or 2% without epinephrine) between the conjunctiva and Tenon capsule. The donor material should be oriented in the host bed so that the limbal side of the graft is adjacent to the cornea in the excision site. The superior bulbar donor site under the eyelid can be left bare. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;13-2</span> shows various types of surgical wound closures after pterygium excision. Covering the entire defect decreases postoperative inflammation and speeds reepithelialization of the ocular surface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the case of either a sliding flap or free graft, the conjunctival tissue is then secured to adjacent conjunctiva (with or without incorporating episclera) with either 8-0 polyglactin (absorbable) sutures or 10-0 nylon (nonabsorbable) sutures, or alternatively with commercially available fibrin glue. Elimination of sutures reduces surgical time and decreases postoperative pain and inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fibrin glue (also called fibrin sealant, fibrin tissue adhesive) mimics natural fibrin formation, ultimately resulting in the formation of a fibrin clot. Several fibrin glues have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are commercially available. These products include TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant (Baxter Healthcare Corp, Westlake Village, CA), EVICEL Fibrin Sealant (Ethicon Inc, Somerville, NJ), and BioGlue Surgical Adhesive (CryoLife Inc, Kennesaw, GA). Another option is the CryoSeal FS System (ThermoGenesis Corp, Rancho Cordova, CA), which can be used in the automated preparation of fibrin sealant from the patient’s own plasma. Currently, use of these products in pterygium surgery is considered off-&#173;label. Also, because both pooled human plasma and bovine products are used to obtain some components of these sealants, the clinician should keep in mind the potential for disease transmission with their use.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the defect created following dissection of the pterygium is considerably larger than what can be covered with an autologous conjunctival graft, then amniotic membrane grafting or simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) are viable options. SLET is a newer technique that optimizes the use of limbal tissue from the healthy fellow eye by combining it with amniotic membrane; see the section Limbal Stem Cell Transplantation, later in the chapter, for a more detailed description.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although there is evidence that the use of mitomycin&#160;C (MMC) with conjunctival grafting reduces the pterygium recurrence rate after surgical excision, further studies are necessary to determine the optimal route of administration and dose, as well as the duration of treatment with MMC and its long-term effects. Any use of topical MMC can be toxic and may cause visually significant complications, such as aseptic scleral necrosis and infectious sclerokeratitis. These complications may occur months or even years after use of the drug. If MMC use is being considered, it is safer to apply this agent intraoperatively than to give it to the patient for postoperative topical application.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Postoperative care</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After pterygium surgery, topical antibiotic drops may be used for 1&#160;week or until reepithelialization occurs, as well as topical steroid drops for approximately 4–6&#160;weeks or as needed until inflammation has subsided. The use of bevacizumab in primary pterygium excision has not been reported to reduce the recurrence rate of this condition.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complications of pterygium excision include conjunctival graft edema, corneoscleral dellen, and epithelial cysts. Pyogenic granuloma due to incomplete removal of subconjunctival and Tenon fibrovascular tissue may also occur, as well as chronic nonhealing wounds if exposed sclera remains uncovered by autologous conjunctiva. Diplopia may result from severe scarring around the medial rectus muscle. Postoperative infections are rare, but cases reported in the literature reveal a poor visual outcome; thus, postoperative care should not be taken lightly.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Autologous Conjunctival Transplantation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Autologous conjunctival transplantation is useful when conjunctival loss is not complicated by extensive damage to the limbal epithelial stem cells. The most common indication for this technique is coverage of bare sclera after pterygium excision (see the section Pterygium Excision, earlier in the chapter). Another indication is a clinically significant pinguecula causing chronic ocular redness and irritation. Conjunctival autografts from the opposite eye have been used to treat fornix foreshortening occurring after localized surgery, such as retinal detachment surgery with a scleral buckle, strabismus surgery, or excision of ocular surface tumors or nevi. Conditions associated with bilateral fornix obliteration (eg, mucous membrane pemphigoid, Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome) are usually systemic, so uninvolved conjunctiva is not available for grafting. Mucous membrane transplantation may be used in these cases and is discussed later in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Conjunctival Flap for Corneal Disease</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A conjunctival flap can be used to cover an unstable or painful corneal surface with a hinged flap of more durable conjunctiva when there is little chance of resolution by normal corneal wound healing. Conjunctival flaps provide a vascularized epithelial cover for the cornea but are not optically clear. Conjunctival flap surgery is performed less frequently now than in the past because of the availability of bandage and scleral contact lenses, commercially available amniotic membrane, use of tarsorrhaphy, and broadened indications for penetrating keratoplasty (PK) and lamellar keratoplasty (see Chapter&#160;15). Nevertheless, the conjunctival flap remains an effective method for managing inflammatory and structural corneal disorders when restoration of vision is not the primary concern. The use of a conjunctival flap is controversial in patients with active microbial keratitis or corneal perforation because residual infectious organisms may proliferate in the avascular corneal stroma beneath the flap. A corneal perforation may continue to leak under the flap.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The principal indications for a conjunctival flap are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-8">chronic, sterile, nonhealing epithelial defects (stromal herpes simplex or herpes <br />zoster virus keratitis, chemical and thermal burns, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, post&#173;infectious ulcers, neurotrophic keratopathy)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">closed but unstable corneal wounds</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">painful bullous keratopathy in a patient who is not a good candidate for PK</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-9">a phthisical eye being prepared for a prosthetic shell</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The disadvantages of conjunctival flap surgery are a reduced view of the anterior chamber and the creation of a potential barrier to drug penetration through the cornea into the anterior chamber. However, a successful conjunctival graft, free of buttonholes, will thin out and if blood vessels regress, may eventually enable usable vision.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Surgical technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A complete (Gundersen) flap (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;13-3, 13-4</span>) is a highly successful technique if the surgeon pays close attention to several fundamental principles for covering the corneal surface with vascularized tissue and keeping this tissue in place:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-8">complete removal of the corneal epithelium and debridement of necrotic tissue from the cornea</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">reinforcement of thin areas with corneal or scleral tissue</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">creation of a mobile, thin conjunctival flap that contains minimal Tenon capsule</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">absence of any conjunctival buttonholes</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-10">absence of any traction on the flap at its margins, which may lead to flap retraction</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Retrobulbar, peribulbar, or general anesthesia should be used for this procedure. The corneal epithelium and all necrotic tissue are first removed, and the eye is retracted inferiorly with an intracorneal traction suture (6-0 silk) at the superior limbus. Elevation of&#160;the flap with subconjunctival injection of lidocaine 1%–2% with epinephrine to separate the conjunctiva from underlying Tenon capsule enhances anesthesia, facilitates dissection, and reduces bleeding. The needle for this injection should not pierce the conjunctiva in the area to be used for the flap.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The dissection may start from either the limbus or the superior fornix. Dissection of conjunctiva from underlying Tenon fascia must be performed carefully to prevent conjunctival perforation, especially in eyes with previous conjunctival surgery. Once the flap has been dissected, a 360° peritomy is performed with relaxing incisions, followed by removal of all remaining limbal and corneal epithelium. Additional undermining of the flap allows it to cover the entire cornea and to rest there without traction. Any residual tension may foster later retraction of the flap. After the flap is positioned over the prepared cornea, it is sutured to the sclera just posterior to the limbus superiorly and inferiorly with 8-0 polyglactin or 10-0 nylon sutures, depending on the surgeon’s preference.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Alternatives to the Gundersen flap are smaller or temporary conjunctival flaps (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-5</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">bipedicle flap</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">advancement flap</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">single pedicle flap</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">These flaps may be used for temporary coverage of small peripheral corneal wounds or areas of ulceration. The advantage is that only small or partial areas of the cornea are covered, so details of the anterior chamber can be visualized, and the patient may regain functional vision. As retraction is a common feature of all of these temporary flaps, the surgeon should take care to minimize tension on any conjunctival flap when it is placed.</p>

			<p class="h3">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retraction is the most common complication of conjunctival flaps, occurring in approximately 10% of cases. Other complications include hemorrhage beneath the flap and epithelial cysts. In some cases, inclusion cysts enlarge to the point of requiring excision or marsupialization. Ptosis, usually due to levator dehiscence in elderly patients, may also occur postoperatively and may or may not be related to the flap itself. Unsatisfactory cosmetic appearance can be improved with a painted cosmetic contact lens. Progressive corneal disease under any type of conjunctival flap is a concern in patients with infectious or autoimmune conditions.</p>
			<p class="h3">Considerations in removal of a flap</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If PK or lamellar keratoplasty is to be performed in an eye with a conjunctival flap, the flap may be removed either as a separate procedure or at the time of keratoplasty. Removal of the flap (without keratoplasty) usually does not succeed in restoring vision, as the underlying cornea is almost always opaque from subepithelial scarring and/or thinned. Because the conjunctival flap procedure tends to destroy or displace most limbal stem cells, a limbal autograft or allograft after removal of the flap may be necessary in order to provide a permanent source of normal epithelial cells before an optical corneal transplant is attempted.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Conjunctival Biopsy</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A conjunctival biopsy can be helpful in evaluating chronic conjunctivitis and unusual ocular surface diseases, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-12">squamous lesions of the conjunctiva (eg, conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">cicatrizing conjunctivitis</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">conjunctival lymphoid tumors</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">lichen planus</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">pemphigus vulgaris</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">graft-vs-host disease</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3">Surgical technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topical anesthetic eyedrops, as well as a pledget soaked with lidocaine 1% or 2%, are applied to the lesion or biopsy site for approximately 30&#160;seconds. Subconjunctival anesthesia (lidocaine 1% or 2% with epinephrine) may also be used; the advantages of injection of lidocaine for local anesthesia are improved analgesia, blanching of the conjunctival vessels, and reduced bleeding. The surgeon uses forceps and scissors to snip a conjunctival specimen sufficient for histologic examination. For a subepithelial lesion, a wedge or block is excised. Grasping only the edge of the specimen minimizes crushing and preserves tissue integrity. Gentle cauterization can be used to facilitate hemostasis after the specimen has been removed.</p>

			<p class="h3">Tissue processing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The sample is placed in the proper anatomical orientation on a carrier template (eg, filter paper) and inserted into the appropriate fixative, such as 10% neutral-&#173;buffered formalin (for histology), 3% glutaraldehyde (for electron microscopy), or Michel or Zeus transport medium (for immunofluorescence microscopy). A preoperative consultation with the pathologist is advised to ensure proper handling and staining of specimens. See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for further discussion of tissue processing.</p>
			<p class="h2">Treatment of Conjunctivochalasis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conjunctivochalasis is characterized by the presence of redundant conjunctival folds positioned between the globe and the lower eyelid margin (see Chapter&#160;4, Fig&#160;4-4 and discussion of conjunctivochalasis in Chapter&#160;4). Surgical procedures used to treat these redundant folds include superficial cauterization, conjunctival fixation, resection, and amniotic membrane grafting.</p>
			<p class="h3">Superficial cauterization</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A topical anesthetic (eg, proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5%) is administered. The patient is instructed to look upward and remains in this position throughout the procedure. After either topical anesthetic or subconjunctival injection of 0.2&#160;mL of lidocaine 1% with epinephrine is given, the surgeon grasps the redundant conjunctiva 4&#160;mm from the limbus and cauterizes it, starting with low-&#173;voltage (power level&#160;0.6) bipolar cauterization and gradually increasing the voltage until the conjunctiva coagulates. Coagulation is considered adequate when the conjunctiva turns white. Coagulation is performed at 5–10&#160;sites in an arc on the inferior bulbar conjunctiva. The slack conjunctiva shrinks and tightens immediately after coagulation.</p>

			<p class="h3">Conjunctival fixation (plication)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lower bulbar conjunctiva is pulled inferiorly, stretched to flatten, and sutured to the inferior sclera with 3 interrupted 6-0 absorbable sutures using episcleral bites inserted 8–10&#160;mm posterior to the limbus. The resulting fold of bulbar conjunctiva must be well below the eyelid margin to prevent the patient from experiencing a foreign-&#173;body sensation after the procedure.</p>
			<p class="h3">Resection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The surgical technique used for resection of the conjunctiva involves a crescent excision of the inferior bulbar conjunctiva 5&#160;mm from the limbus, followed by suture closure. A modified technique to avoid visible scarring or retraction of the inferior conjunctival fornix includes a peritomy made close to the limbus, followed by 2&#160;radial relaxing incisions to excise the redundant conjunctiva. Some surgeons use fibrin glue instead of sutures to close the conjunctival wound.</p>
			<p class="h3">Amniotic membrane grafting</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After excision of the redundant crescent of conjunctiva, an amniotic membrane is fitted to cover the entire defect and placed with the basement membrane surface up to cover the scleral wound. The membrane is secured to the surrounding conjunctival edge with interrupted fine, absorbable, or nylon sutures with episcleral bites. The surgeon must take care to flatten the membrane tightly onto the scleral surface and approximately to or underneath the epithelial edge.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Limbal Stem Cell Transplantation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The peripheral corneal epithelium is derived from stem cells residing in the basal layer of the corneal limbus. However, when the limbal stem cells are not functioning properly, the conjunctival epithelium proliferates over the surface of the cornea. Conjunctival cells do not have the pluripotency of limbal stem cells and cannot differentiate into the corneal phenotype. Replacement of the corneal epithelium by conjunctival epithelium is characterized by abnormal epithelium on the cornea, vascularization, surface irregularity, absence of the limbal palisades of Vogt, and poor epithelial adhesion, a process called <span class="italic">conjunctivalization.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Minor disturbances to the corneal limbal stem cell function or surface may be reversible with medical therapy using topical corticosteroid drops, topical cyclosporine, oral doxycycline, punctal occlusion, frequent topical lubrication, or a combination of these modalities.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If total loss of limbal stem cells occurs unilaterally, an autograft of limbal epithelium from the fellow eye can repopulate the diseased cornea with normal corneal epithelium (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-6</span>). In this procedure, the unhealthy corneal epithelium, conjunctiva, and any pannus are removed from within 2&#160;mm of the limbus of the recipient eye, and 2&#160;thin limbal autografts from the fellow eye are then attached to the limbus to facilitate the regeneration and proliferation of corneal epithelial cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If total loss of limbal stem cells occurs bilaterally, the patient may receive stem cells from a living related donor (ie, a limbal stem cell allograft) or from an eye bank donor cornea (ie, a keratolimbal allograft). A limbal stem cell allograft may decrease the risk of rejection but requires immunosuppression; it also enables more conjunctiva to be harvested and transplanted than does a keratolimbal allograft. Although host cells may eventually reject or replace such tissue, good long-term results have been reported using both techniques. Poor epithelial viability and complications from systemic immunosuppression are considerable obstacles to be overcome, but dramatic success has been observed in some cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET)</span> is a promising new technique for unilateral stem cell injury that obviates the need for intensive systemic immunosuppression, which conventional transplantation requires (see also Pterygium Excision, earlier in the chapter). After the abnormal cornea is denuded of pannus with a superficial keratectomy and covered with amniotic membrane, a small 2&#160;<span class="math">×</span>&#160;2-mm strip of donor limbal tissue from the healthy fellow eye is divided into 8 or 10 pieces; these are placed evenly over the cornea with fibrin adhesive and then covered with a bandage contact lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cell culture of corneal stem cells has been shown to be an effective source of corneal surface repopulation; however, the long-term survival of these grafts remains uncertain. Epithelial cells present in the oral mucosa and the human umbilical cord are emerging as important sources of cultured stem cells; at present, these approaches remain experimental and are available in few centers worldwide.</p>

			<p class="h2">Mucous Membrane Grafting</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the absence of healthy conjunctiva (eg, in bilateral cicatricial conjunctival disease), mucous membrane may be used to restore the conjunctival surface to a more functional state. The goals of restoration are to create a more normal fornix and to reduce ocular surface inflammation, as well as to minimize corneal damage from the abnormal eyelid–globe relationships (eg, entropion, trichiasis), chronic exposure (lagophthalmos), and direct corneal trauma (palpebral conjunctival keratinization) that usually accompany bilateral cicatricial conjunctival disorders (see Table&#160;13-1). Mucous membrane grafts increase ocular surface wetting by improving eyelid movement and distribution of the tear film over the cornea, thereby reducing exposure and evaporation. These grafts also provide suitable extracellular matrix substrate for epithelial cell migration and adhesion, but they are not effective in replacing normal stem cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Mucous membrane grafting has produced good results in inactive cicatricial disorders such as late-stage, nonprogressive Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome and quiescent mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP). A combination of limbal allografting, amniotic membrane transplantation, and tarsorrhaphy, followed by the use of serum-&#173;derived tears and systemic immunosuppression, allows reconstruction of the ocular surface. Patients with advanced, progressive stage&#160;III or IV MMP require advanced immunosuppressive treatment to reduce active inflammation prior to any grafting procedure (see the discussion of MMP in Chapter&#160;11). Keratoprosthesis is another treatment for patients with late-stage cicatricial disease (see Chapter&#160;15).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Multiple surgical techniques for mucosal grafting are available; the reader is encouraged to consult a surgical textbook or video for discussion and illustration of these techniques (see the reference list that follows). Potential complications, regardless of the technique, include buttonholing, graft retraction, trichiasis, surface keratinization of the graft, ptosis, blepharophimosis, depressed eyelid blink, lagophthalmos, submucosal abscess formation, and persistent nonhealing epithelial defects of the cornea.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Superficial Keratectomy and Corneal Biopsy</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In superficial keratectomy, the surgeon excises the superficial layers of cornea (epithelium, Bowman layer, or superficial stroma) without replacing the tissue. The primary indications are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-8">removal of hyperplastic or necrotic tissue (eg, corneal dermoid, pterygium, Salzmann nodular degeneration, epithelial basement membrane redundancy, degenerative calcification)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">excision of retained foreign material in the cornea</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">need for tissue for diagnosis (histology or microbiology)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">excision of scar tissue or superficial corneal dystrophic tissue</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">If corneal biopsy is performed for histology, preservation of tissue integrity and anatomical orientation is important. A small specimen can be placed on a filter or thin card to maintain the tissue orientation before fixation or cryosection. For microbiology workup, the biopsied specimens can be minced or homogenized before inoculation of the culture media or tissue smear for histochemical staining.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Surgical techniques</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Mechanical keratectomy</span> If the corneal lesion is superficial, it may be possible to scrape or peel it away without sharp dissection. Often, a smooth anatomical tissue plane anterior to the Bowman layer can be achieved with sweeping strokes parallel to the tissue through the use of a metal spatula blade or a cellulose sponge. In some cases, such as in Salzmann nodular degeneration, it is possible to gently peel the abnormal tissue off using a 0.12&#160;forceps. When deeper dissection is required, the surgeon can either mark the area freehand with an adjustable-&#173;depth blade or use a trephine. A 2- to 3-mm disposable dermatologic skin punch trephine blade can be used to create a partial-&#173;thickness incision, and forceps and scissors are then used to excise a lamellar flap of cornea. The specimen is generally split into 2&#160;pieces, or separate biopsies are taken, so that tissue can be sent for both histologic and microbiologic examination.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-15"><span class="h4-head">Phototherapeutic keratectomy</span> The excimer laser can be used to remove superficial stromal tissue. However, abnormal tissue, like corneal scars or calcium deposits (as in band keratopathy), may ablate at a different rate than normal tissue, so an uneven surface results even if the original surface was smooth. Manual techniques are more likely to respect the Bowman layer and maintain a smooth ocular surface, as the laser does not respect anatomical planes. Frequent application of viscous liquid to the corneal surface during laser ablation can fill in gaps in the surface and help achieve a smooth surface after ablation. Most patients experience a hyperopic shift after phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) from the corneal-&#173;flattening effect of the procedure. Nevertheless, PTK is an excellent option in selected patients with superficial (less than 100 µm deep) stromal scarring or dystrophies when manual techniques are not feasible. PTK may postpone or eliminate the need for corneal transplantation. Topical MMC applied to the corneal ablation zone for a brief period following PTK has been shown to decrease postoperative scar formation. Oral vitamin C has been used prophylactically to reduce haze formation in PTK.</p>

			<p class="h2">Management of Persistent Corneal Epithelial Defects, Thinning, and Perforation</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Patching</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal surface disorders such as dellen, rheumatoid melt, and descemetocele can be managed by patching on a short-term basis. A partial tarsorrhaphy can sometimes be very effective and restore some vision to the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Persistent epithelial defects and recurrent erosions of the cornea result from defects in the surface epithelium that fail to heal in a timely fashion (see Chapter&#160;4). Trauma from the eyelids during blinking can retard reepithelialization, and if delayed, reepithelialization is further slowed by chronic changes in the basement membrane and anterior stroma. Patching may be successful over the short term. However, it compromises corneal oxygenation and impairs vision; also, some patients cannot tolerate closure of the eye while it is patched.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Bandage contact lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Application of a thin, oxygen-&#173;permeable, continuous-&#173;wear soft contact lens as a therapeutic bandage can protect loosely adherent remaining or regenerating epithelium from the “windshield-&#173;wiper” action of the blinking eyelids. Use of bandage contact lenses has significantly improved and simplified the management of recurrent erosions and persistent epithelial defects. These lenses help reduce stromal leukocyte infiltration and promote regeneration of basement membrane and restoration of tight epithelial–stromal adhesion without compromising corneal oxygenation, patient comfort, or vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Careful consideration should be given to the choice of a soft contact lens for patients with severe dry eye. In general, patients with dry eye run a high risk of infection with soft contact lenses; punctal occlusion should be performed in these patients to facilitate lens retention and comfort. Contact lenses with high oxygen transmissibility (eg, hydroxyethyl methacrylate [HEMA]–silicone polymer) are theoretically the most appropriate choice in this setting. Silicone lenses should be replaced every 2–4&#160;weeks or as deposits accumulate on the lens. Frequent lubrication, prophylaxis with antibiotics, and close follow-&#173;up are crucial, especially in patients with decreased corneal sensitivity or dry eye. If a conventional soft lens is not tolerated, the use of an acrylic scleral lens may circumvent the problems encountered with a smaller-&#173;diameter hydrogel lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Continuous wear of a soft lens can relieve the symptoms of painful bullous or filamentary keratopathy. However, long-term use of a bandage contact lens can also lead to hypoxia, corneal pannus, limbal stem cell damage, and vascularization, all of which can compromise the success of future PK for vision rehabilitation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tarsorrhaphy should be considered for patients who have contact lens complications or a high risk of infection. The tarsorrhaphy procedure is described later in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Treatment of corneal thinning/descemetocele</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal thinning may occur secondary to dellen where the tear film is uneven or may result from stromal inflammation and necrosis. In patients with dellen, the epithelium is intact, but there is an area of thinning next to an area of elevated or edematous tissue. In these cases, short-term patching may be sufficient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with corneal thinning down to the Descemet membrane (descemetocele) that is secondary to stromal infection or inflammation, the condition is much more serious because the epithelium is not intact and the patient is at risk for corneal perforation. The goals of therapy are to treat the inflammation or infectious component and to facilitate reepithelialization, which prevents progression of stromal collagenolysis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The first order of therapy is to use appropriate antibiotics and anti-&#173;inflammatory medications. Topical steroids may reduce inflammation but should be used with caution with aggressive corneal melts. In patients with autoimmune conditions, conjunctival resection in the quadrant of a peripheral melt can be useful. In some cases, cyanoacrylate glue (also called cyanoacrylate adhesive) is helpful. Once the inflammation or infection has been controlled, a bandage lens or tarsorrhaphy may facilitate reepithelialization.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An alternative to using cyanoacrylate for a descemetocele is to use amniotic membrane that has been cut to the shape of the defect and then place a patch into the defect where the near-&#173;perforation is located. The patch and smaller amniotic membrane may be held in place with a larger amniotic membrane patch, nylon sutures, and a bandage contact lens, or by means of fibrin glue. With time, scar tissue will reinforce the deficient area and may circumvent the need for a corneal transplant.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Treatment of perforation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some corneal perforations are small and seal spontaneously before ophthalmic examination, with no intraocular damage, prolapse, or adherence. These cases may require only treatment with systemic and/or topical antibiotic therapy, along with close observation. If a corneal wound is leaking but the anterior chamber remains formed, the leakage may be sealed with pharmacologic suppression of aqueous production (topical ocular hypotensive agent or systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor), patching, or a bandage contact lens. Generally, if these measures fail to seal the wound within 2&#160;days, cyanoacrylate glue is another option (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-7</span>). Perforations measuring more than 1–2&#160;mm are usually not amenable to tissue adhesive and require supplemental tissue (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Cyanoacrylate glue</span> Although cyanoacrylate glues have not been approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use, they have been utilized effectively and extensively over the past 3&#160;decades to seal impending or small (&lt;2&#160;mm) perforations. Cyanoacrylate glue applied to thinned or ulcerated corneal tissue may prevent further thinning and can prevent leakage through the period of vascularization and repair. The adhesive plug is also thought to retard the entry of inflammatory cells and epithelium into the area, thus decreasing the rate of corneal melting. After the lesion has been sealed, new stromal tissue may be laid down, and accompanying corneal vascularization may help ensure the integrity of the area by providing nutrients and antiproteases.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h5-head">surgical technique</span> Cyanoacrylate glue can usually be applied on an outpatient basis using topical anesthetics. However, if adherent or prolapsed uvea in the leakage site or a flat chamber is encountered, the procedure may be best performed in the operating room using balanced salt solution and/or viscoelastic to re-form the anterior chamber. An eyelid speculum is necessary to keep the eyelids open and immobilized. Before the adhesive is applied, necrotic tissue and corneal epithelium should be removed from the involved area out to a 2-mm zone. The area should then be dried with a cellulose sponge.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The easiest way to apply glue is under biomicroscopic magnification. A small drop of the fluid adhesive is applied to the corneal wound with the tip of a 30-gauge needle or anterior chamber cannula. The glue does not polymerize on plastic, so an alternative way to apply the adhesive is to spread a small amount on the inside of the sterile plastic wrapping of any medical product that has been cut to a size slightly larger than the perforation. The glue can then be applied to the surface of the cornea in as thin a layer as possible using the plastic handle of a cellulose sponge or the wooden stick of a cotton-&#173;tipped applicator. The glue polymerizes completely within 20–60&#160;seconds and usually adheres well to the deepithelialized surface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The adhesive plug has a rough surface and can be irritating, so a bandage contact lens is necessary to protect the upper tarsal conjunctiva and to prevent the plug from being dislodged by blinking.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Tattoo for Corneal Scars</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal tattooing has been used for centuries to improve the cosmetic appearance of a blind eye with an unsightly leukoma. It has also been used occasionally in seeing eyes to reduce the glare from scars and to eliminate monocular diplopia in patients with large iridectomies, traumatic loss of iris, and congenital iris colobomas (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-9</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Different techniques may be used to create a tattoo. One involves applying a platinum-&#173;ion solution to the cornea. When this solution reacts with a second agent, a black precipitate is formed in the cornea, producing a dark deposit that can simulate a pupil. Another technique involves utilizing the standard methods used in skin tattooing: applying to the cornea a paste of colored pigment, either India ink or a metal oxide, and then using a hypodermic needle or angled blade to drive the pigment into the corneal stroma in the area that needs coverage. Multiple superficial punctures are made until enough pigment has been applied; multiple pigment colors can be used to give a more natural appearance. However, the method is time-&#173;consuming and often needs to be repeated if the pigment uptake is inadequate or the pigment migrates. Femtosecond laser–assisted anterior lamellar corneal staining/tattooing in the cosmetic treatment of leukocoria is under investigation.</p>

			<p class="h2">Tarsorrhaphy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tarsorrhaphy, the surgical fusion of the upper and lower eyelid margins, is performed to reduce the exposed surface area of the cornea. It is among the safest, most effective, and most underutilized procedures for healing difficult-&#173;to-treat corneal lesions. Tarsorrhaphy is most commonly performed to protect the cornea from exposure caused by inadequate eyelid coverage, as may occur in dellen, neurotrophic cornea, thyroid eye disease, or facial nerve (cranial nerve&#160;VII) dysfunctions such as Bell palsy. It can also be used to aid in the healing of indolent corneal ulceration, as is sometimes seen with tear film deficiency, herpes simplex or herpes zoster infection, or stem cell dysfunction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tarsorrhaphies are classified as lateral (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-10</span>), medial, or central according to the position of the adhesion of the palpebral fissure. BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> discusses eyelid anatomy and surgical technique for tarsorrhaphy in detail. Because the cosmetic effect of a lateral tarsorrhaphy is significant, patients may be reluctant to undergo this procedure and should be counseled on its therapeutic benefits.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tarsorrhaphy may be temporary (Frost suture) or permanent. The Frost suture, a surgical procedure involving use of a transtarsal plate suture to keep the eyelids closed but entailing no intramarginal adhesion, can be employed to partially occlude the eyelids for up to 2–3&#160;weeks. If closure of more than 3 weeks is desired or if the length of time is uncertain, then permanent but reversible adhesion is induced by denuding the eyelid margin. Plastic stints or bolsters can be used to protect the eyelids from tight sutures, allow the suture tension to close the eyelids the desired amount, and reduce patient discomfort due to the sutures (see Fig&#160;13-10).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A tarsorrhaphy can be released under local anesthesia in the office. After infiltration of local anesthetic, a muscle hook is placed under the tissue, and a hemostat is placed (for 5&#160;seconds) across the adhesion to be released. A blade or scissors are used to incise the tarsorrhaphy adhesion parallel to the upper and lower eyelid margins. If the status of the corneal exposure is uncertain, the tarsorrhaphy can be opened in stages, a few millimeters at a time. If the tarsorrhaphy has been performed properly, eyelid margin deformity is minimal.</p>
			<p class="h3">Alternatives to tarsorrhaphy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Injection of onabotulinumtoxinA into the levator palpebrae superioris muscle to paralyze its function can cause pharmacologic ptosis and, similar to a surgical tarsorrhaphy, can impart a protective effect that lasts up to 6&#160;months. Application of cyanoacrylate adhesive (discussed earlier in this chapter) to the eyelid margins may also enable temporary closure of the eyelids. However, both techniques have endpoints that are out of the control of the treating surgeon.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tape may also be used to temporarily close the eyelids, but tape rarely lasts longer than 24&#160;hours. Use of moisture-&#173;retaining eyewear (also called moisture chamber glasses) is another temporary measure that may be used to minimize desiccation and help protect the ocular surface. These devices are available commercially or may be constructed with plastic wrap and taped over the eyelids.</p>
