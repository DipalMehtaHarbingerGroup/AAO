			<p class="em-only_endmatter-title">Answers</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-9">a. </span><span class="CharOverride-8">Findings from the examination are suggestive of conjunctival xerosis (abnormal dryness of the conjunctiva), which is due to vitamin A deficiency and is associated with deficiency in the mucin component of the tear film caused by degeneration of the goblet cells. Mucin is produced by the goblet cells within the conjunctiva. Lipid, another component of the tear film, is produced by the meibomian glands. A reduced level of lactoferrin, a protein found in tears, can be a marker for dry eye. Immunoglobulin E levels in tears are elevated in allergic conjunctivitis. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;2.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-9">c. </span><span class="CharOverride-8">Many factors contribute to hydration of the cornea. There is a natural tendency of the cornea to swell as the negatively charged glycosaminoglycans in the stroma repel each other (swelling pressure). Conversely, intraocular pressure has a compressive force on the cornea. In cases of hypotony, the compressive force is reduced, leading to increased corneal hydration and, in some cases, detectable corneal edema. Hypertonic drops draw fluid out of the cornea by creating an osmotic gradient. Salzmann nodular degeneration and topical ofloxacin have no effect on hydration of the corneal stroma.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;3.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-9">a. </span><span class="CharOverride-8">Placido disk topography is based on the principle of reflecting images of concentric rings or mires off the corneal surface. In areas where the tear film or corneal surface is irregular, such as in epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, the mires are distorted. Reflected images are captured and analyzed by computer software, which can translate them into color topography maps. Color-coded maps help accentuate normal and pathologic patterns. Regular astigmatism is characterized by a symmetric bow-tie pattern oriented on the steep axis. Inferior steepening in a “crab-claw” configuration is classic for pellucid marginal degeneration. Central flattening is suggestive of a previous myopic ablation. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;4.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-9">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-8"> Punctate and macroulcerative epithelial defects stain with fluorescein (positive staining); the staining appears bright green when illuminated with a cobalt-blue filter. Dendrites and corneal abrasions display positive fluorescein staining. Dellen display either positive fluorescein staining or pooling of the dye. Fluorescein can also be used to distinguish lesions that project through the tear film. These lesions are described as having negative staining because they take on a darker appearance when contrasted with the surrounding fluorescein in the tear film. Maps seen in epithelial basement membrane dystrophy display negative staining with fluorescein when viewed with a cobalt-blue filter.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;5.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-9">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-8"> Tetracyclines such as minocycline and doxycycline are commonly used to treat rosacea and meibomian gland dysfunction, but prescribers must be aware of the potential adverse effects of these drugs, which include photosensitization, gastrointestinal upset, and oral or vaginal candidiasis (with long-term use). Tetracyclines are contraindicated in children younger than 8 years (because of the potential for discoloration of developing teeth) and in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Also, tetracyclines can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. In patients taking warfarin, such as the one described in the question, tetracyclines can potentiate anticoagulant effects and should be avoided if possible. Azithromycin is an alternative oral treatment, but the US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning that this medication may be hazardous to patients with cardiovascular problems because it has the potential to cause irregularities in heart rhythm. Erythromycin is another alternative oral treatment; the risk of adverse reactions in this case would be lowest with this drug.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;6.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-9">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-8"> This patient has bilateral punctate staining with whorled epithelium in the absence of aqueous tear deficiency and evaporative dry eye. These clinical findings, along with her </span><span class="CharOverride-8">use of multiple eyedrops, are suggestive of toxic keratitis; benzalkonium chloride, the preservative found in most eyedrops, is a common offender. Switching to preservative-free alternatives is likely to improve the ocular surface. Adding topical steroids, increasing the frequency of generic artificial tears (which generally contain preservatives), or performing punctal occlusion would all increase exposure to preservatives and could worsen the condition.</span></p>

A major factor in drug deposition is pH-dependent solubility of the drug. Also, patients with dry eye using eyedrops more frequently and for a prolonged period are prone to drug precipitation. Corneal deposits are more common in the interpalpebral region because of ultraviolet radiation–induced corneal damage and because of the maximum accumulation of topical ophthalmic medications in this part of the eye. These cases can be managed conservatively, avoiding debridement; deposits resolve after discontinuation of the medication. </span></p>

Although major efforts have been undertaken to decrease the incidence of trachoma, it remains endemic in the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. The distinctive features are conjunctival and corneal scarring (predominantly superiorly, although severe cases may be diffuse), bandlike or stellate tarsal scarring (also typically superiorly), trichiasis, and aqueous tear deficiency. Entropion and tear duct obstruction are also common. The ocular manifestations of autoimmune disease (eg, Sjögren syndrome, mucous membrane pemphigoid) can be similar, but the superior predilection, place of birth, and relatively young age favor the diagnosis of trachoma. Cicatrizing changes from severe viral conjunctivitis (adenoviral, HSV, etc) are possible but still less likely.

Treatment includes identifying and minimizing allergens in the environment and in foods. Moisturizing lotions and petrolatum gels can be useful for skin hydration. Acute lesions can be controlled with a topical corticosteroid cream or ointment (eg, clobetasone butyrate 0.05%), but to avoid skin thinning and ocular complications of steroids, long-term use of such medications is strongly discouraged. Both topical and oral T-cell inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus) have been found effective and have fewer adverse effects than corticosteroids, so they are preferred in patients with chronic and severe disease. Oral antipruritic agents such as antihistamines and mast-cell stabilizers can alleviate itching but may exacerbate dry eye with their anticholinergic activity.

Cell culture (ex vivo expansion) of corneal stem cells has been shown to be an effective source for corneal surface repopulation; however, this technique remains experimental and is not available in the United States. Allogeneic limbal stem cell transplantation requires systemic immunosuppression as part of the postoperative regimen and is not needed when the unaffected eye can serve as a donor.
