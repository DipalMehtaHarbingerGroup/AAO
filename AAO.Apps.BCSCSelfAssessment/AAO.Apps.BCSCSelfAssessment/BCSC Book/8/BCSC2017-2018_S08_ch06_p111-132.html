        <div id="Chapt6_Top2">
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Degeneration of a tissue refers to decomposition and deterioration of tissue elements and functions. For a proper diagnosis, it is important to distinguish corneal degenerations, which infrequently exhibit an inheritance pattern, from corneal dystrophies (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-1</span>).</p>
            <p class="h2">Age-Related Changes</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">As a result of aging, the conjunctiva loses transparency and becomes thinner. The <span class="italic">substantia propria</span> (stroma) becomes less elastic, causing conjunctival laxity. In older individuals, the conjunctival vessels may become more prominent. Saccular telangiectasias, fusiform dilatory changes, or tortuosities may appear in the vessels. These changes are not necessarily uniform; they tend to be more pronounced in the region of the interpalpebral fissure, corresponding to the area most commonly exposed to the environment.</p>
            <p class="h2">Pinguecula</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">A pinguecula is a common conjunctival condition that occurs typically on the nasal side of the bulbar conjunctiva, adjacent to the limbus in the interpalpebral zone. It is usually bilateral, appears as a yellow-&#173;white elevated mass (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-1</span>), and occurs as a result of the effects of aging, UV&#160;light exposure, and environmental insults such as dust and wind. Pingueculae represent an elastotic degeneration (the material stains for elastin but is not broken down by elastase) of subepithelial collagen with hyalinized connective tissue. The mass may enlarge gradually over long periods of time. There may be recurrent inflammation and ocular irritation. Lubricant therapy to alleviate ocular irritation is the mainstay of treatment. Excision is indicated only when pingueculae are cosmetically unacceptable, when they become chronically inflamed, or when they interfere with contact lens wear. Judicious use of topical corticosteroids may be considered for patients with inflammation, but their use as long-term therapy for pingueculae is strongly discouraged because of their adverse effects.</p>
            <p class="h2">Pterygium</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">A pterygium is a wing-&#173;shaped growth of conjunctiva and fibrovascular tissue on the superficial cornea (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-2</span>). As with pingueculae, the pathogenesis of pterygia is strongly correlated with UV&#160;light exposure, although environmental insults such as exposure to dust, wind, or other irritants causing chronic ocular inflammation may also be factors. The predominance of pterygia on the nasal side in the interpalpebral zone is theorized to result from light passing medially through the cornea, focusing on the nasal limbus area, while the shadow of the nose reduces the intensity of light transmitted to the temporal limbus. The prevalence of pterygia increases steadily with proximity to the equator, and the condition is more common in men than women, in persons 20–30&#160;years of age (the most common age range for onset of pterygia), and in people who work outdoors. The histopathology of pterygia is similar to that of pingueculae (basophilic degeneration of elastotic fibers), except that a pterygium invades the superficial cornea, which is preceded by dissolution of the Bowman layer. For further discussion of the histopathology of both pingueculae and pterygia, see BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors.</span></p>
            <p class="body-text">Astigmatism (regular and irregular), as well as corneal scarring, occurs in proportion to pterygium size. A pigmented iron line <span class="italic">(Stocker line)</span> may be seen in the cornea, anterior to the edge of the pterygium. A pterygium must be distinguished from a pseudopterygium, which may occur after trauma or chemical burns or secondary to inflammatory corneal disease. It is important to maintain an index of suspicion for carcinoma in situ or squamous cell carcinoma, primarily in patients with atypical presentations.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Treatment with artificial tears can alleviate associated ocular irritation, but as with pingueculae, long-term use of topical corticosteroids is contraindicated. Excision is indicated if the pterygium causes persistent discomfort or chronic irritation; exhibits progressive growth toward the central cornea or visual axis (&gt;3–4&#160;mm), causing blurred vision or irregular astigmatism; is cosmetically unacceptable; or restricts ocular motility. See Chapter&#160;13 for discussion of the surgical treatment of pterygium.</p>
            <p class="h2">Conjunctival Concretions</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Concretions appear to be epithelial inclusion cysts filled with epithelial and keratin debris, as well as mucopolysaccharide and mucin. They are seen as small, yellow-&#173;white dots in the palpebral conjunctiva of older patients or patients who have had chronic conjunctivitis. Concretions are almost always asymptomatic, but they may erode the overlying epithelium, causing foreign-&#173;body sensation. If symptomatic, concretions can be easily removed under topical anesthesia.</p>
            <p class="h2">Conjunctival Epithelial Inclusion Cysts</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Conjunctival epithelial inclusion cysts are clear lesions that appear in either the bulbar conjunctiva or the conjunctival fornix and are typically incidental findings on examination (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-3</span>). As these cysts are usually asymptomatic, they do not require treatment. If the cyst is symptomatic, simple drainage is not sufficient, because the inner epithelial cell wall remains, allowing the cyst to re-form. Complete excision is necessary to prevent recurrence.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Conjunctival inclusion cysts can be congenital or acquired. Most acquired cysts of the conjunctiva are derived from an inclusion of conjunctival epithelium in the substantia propria. The implanted cells proliferate to form a central fluid-&#173;filled cavity that is lined by nonkeratinized conjunctival epithelium. Conjunctival cysts may also form from ductal epithelium of the accessory lacrimal glands; these cysts are lined by a double layer of epithelium. Stimuli for cyst formation include chronic inflammation, trauma, and surgery. Dilated lymphatic channels may mimic an inclusion cyst of the bulbar conjunctiva.</p>
            <p class="h2">Conjunctivochalasis</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Poor adherence of the bulbar conjunctiva leading to redundancy of conjunctiva is referred to as conjunctivochalasis. This condition is described in Chapter&#160;4, and its treatment is discussed in Chapter&#160;13.</p>
            <p class="h2">Conjunctival Vascular Tortuosity and Hyperemia</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">There are many causes of conjunctival vascular tortuosity and hyperemia. A differential diagnosis is outlined in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-2</span>.</p>
        </div>
    <p class="h1">Degenerations of the Cornea</p>
    <div id="Chapt6_Top3">
        <p class="h2-h1">Age-Related Changes</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">As a result of aging, the cornea gradually becomes flatter in the vertical meridian, thinner, and slightly less transparent. Its refractive index increases, and the Descemet membrane becomes thicker, increasing from 3&#160;µm at birth to 13&#160;µm in adults. With age, occasional peripheral endothelial guttae, sometimes known as <span class="italic">Hassall-&#173;Henle bodies,</span> may form (discussed later in the chapter). Age-&#173;related attrition of corneal endothelial cells results in a loss of approximately 100,000&#160;cells during the first 50&#160;years of life, from a cell density of about 4000&#160;cells/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> at birth to a density of 2500–3000&#160;cells/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> in older adults.</p>
        <p class="h2">Epithelial and Subepithelial Degenerations</p>
        <p class="h3-h2">Coats white ring</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Coats white ring</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-4</span>) refers to a small (1&#160;mm or less in diameter) circular or oval area of discrete gray-white dots seen in the superficial corneal stroma and representing iron-&#173;containing fibrotic remnants of a metallic foreign body. Once these lesions mature and are free of any associated inflammation, they do not change; hence, therapy with corticosteroids or other anti-&#173;inflammatory agents is not indicated.</p>
        <p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Spheroidal degeneration</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Spheroidal degeneration is characterized by the appearance in the cornea, and sometimes in the conjunctiva, of translucent, golden-&#173;brown, spheroidal deposits in the subepithelium, Bowman layer, or superficial stroma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-5</span>). The condition has been reported under different names, including <span class="italic">actinic keratopathy, climatic droplet keratopathy, Bietti nodular dystrophy,</span> and <span class="italic">Labrador keratopathy.</span> In <span class="italic">primary spheroidal degeneration,</span> the deposits are bilateral and initially located in the nasal and temporal cornea. With age, they can extend onto the conjunctiva in the interpalpebral zone. The primary degeneration is unrelated to the coexistence of other ocular disease. In rare cases, generally in childhood, the spheroidal deposits extend across the interpalpebral zone of the cornea, producing a noncalcific band-shaped keratopathy. The etiology is controversial, but the deposits may develop from UV radiation–induced alteration of preexisting structural connective tissue components or from the synthesis of abnormal extracellular material in limbal conjunctiva. <span class="italic">Secondary spheroidal degeneration</span> is associated with ocular injury or inflammation. The deposits aggregate near the area of corneal scarring or vascularization. All cases show extracellular, proteinaceous, hyaline deposits with characteristics of elastotic degeneration; these deposits are thought to be secondary to the combined effects of genetic predisposition, actinic exposure associated with temperature extremes, age, and perhaps various kinds of environmental trauma other than sunlight, such as dust and wind. The deposit composition is not lipid, despite its “oil droplet” appearance. Medical therapy is not of much value, but ocular lubrication is recommended to address uneven layering of the tear film over affected areas. In cases of central corneal involvement, superficial keratectomy or phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) using an excimer laser may be indicated.</p>
        <p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Iron deposition</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most iron lines are related to abnormalities of tear pooling due to ocular surface irregularities (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-6</span>). Often, the clinician can see these lines only by using red-free or diffuse illumination with a cobalt-&#173;blue filter before instilling fluorescein. A <span class="italic">Fleischer ring,</span> representing iron deposition in keratoconus, is one of many corneal iron lines associated with epithelial irregularities (see Chapter&#160;7, Fig&#160;7-27). This ring is extremely useful as a diagnostic sign in mild or early cases of keratoconus. The <span class="italic">Hudson-&#173;Stähli line,</span> generally located at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third of the cornea, is ubiquitous. Iron lines are also associated with keratorefractive surgery. Following radial keratotomy, visually insignificant iron lines are noted in the inferior paracentral cornea in approximately 80% of patients and are commonly characterized as a “tear star.” Corneal iron lines are summarized in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-3</span>.</p>
        <p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Calcific band keratopathy</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Calcific band keratopathy is a degeneration of the superficial cornea that involves mainly the Bowman layer. The degeneration begins as fine, dustlike, basophilic deposits in the Bowman layer. These changes are usually first seen peripherally, in the 3- and 9-o’clock positions. Eventually, the deposits may coalesce to form a horizontal band of dense calcific plaques across the interpalpebral zone of the cornea (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-7</span>). Small cracks can occur in the band as a result of fractures in the calcium deposits. In addition, small, lucent holes, representing corneal nerves that penetrate the Bowman layer, can be seen throughout the opacity.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The condition can be idiopathic, but the chief known causes are</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet-list-first">chronic ocular (usually inflammatory) disease such as uveitis in children, interstitial keratitis, severe superficial keratitis, and phthisis bulbi</li>
            <li class="bullet-list-mid">hypercalcemia due to hyperparathyroidism, vitamin&#160;D toxicity, milk-&#173;alkali syndrome, sarcoidosis, or other systemic disorders</li>
            <li class="bullet-list-mid">hereditary transmission (primary hereditary band keratopathy, with or without other anomalies)</li>
            <li class="bullet-list-mid">elevated serum phosphorus level with normal serum calcium level (may occur in patients with renal failure, particularly if they are not receiving appropriate treatment to lower serum phosphate concentrations)</li>
            <li class="bullet-list-mid">chronic exposure to mercurial vapors or to mercurial preservatives (phenylmercuric nitrate or acetate) in ophthalmic medications (the mercury causes changes in corneal collagen that result in the deposition of calcium)</li>
            <li class="bullet-list-last">silicone oil, instilled in an aphakic eye</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Band keratopathy may also result from the deposition of urates in the cornea. The urates appear brown, unlike the gray-white calcific deposits, and may be associated with gout or hyperuricemia.</p>
        <p class="body-text">A workup (eg, serum electrolytes and urinalysis) to rule out associated metabolic or renal disease should be considered. Underlying conditions, such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca or renal failure, should be treated or controlled as much as possible, which may reduce or control the deposition of calcium or at least help reduce the recurrence of band keratopathy. The calcium can usually be removed from the Bowman layer by chelation with a neutral solution of disodium EDTA, which can be warmed to speed up the chemical chelation. The usual concentration of EDTA (0.05&#160;mol/L), 0.5%–1.5%, can be obtained through a compounding pharmacy. The epithelium overlying the calcium needs to be removed before the chelating solution is applied. Any cylindrical tube that approximates the corneal diameter (eg, corneal trephine) can facilitate the process by acting as a reservoir to confine the chelating solution to the desired treatment area; however, this is not always necessary. With the reservoir in place, very gentle surface agitation with a truncated cellulose sponge (mechanical debridement) may further enhance the release of the impregnated calcium. Certain types of calcium deposits can be removed with forceps alone. In any case, the deposit should be excised carefully to avoid further damage to the Bowman layer. A fibrous pannus may be present along with extensive calcific band keratopathy, especially if silicone oil is responsible; neither EDTA nor scraping will remove such fibrous tissue. A bandage contact lens can be helpful postoperatively until the epithelium has healed. Band keratopathy can recur but may not do so for years, at which time the treatment may be repeated. PTK using an excimer laser is not advised as primary treatment, because calcium ablates at a different rate than stroma and thus could produce a severely irregular surface. If there is residual opacification after the initial EDTA chelation, PTK may be used.</p>

        <p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Stromal Degenerations</p>
        <p class="h3-h2">White limbal girdle of Vogt</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Two forms of the white limbal girdle of Vogt have been described. Type&#160;I is a narrow, concentric, whitish superficial band running along the limbus in the palpebral fissure and is generally thought to represent early calcific band keratopathy. A lucid interval appears between the limbus and the girdle. This girdle is a degenerative change of the anterior limiting membrane, with chalklike opacities and small clear areas resembling the holes in Swiss cheese. Type&#160;II consists of small, white, flecklike, and needlelike deposits that are often seen at the nasal and temporal limbus in older patients. No clear interval separates this girdle from the limbus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-8</span>). Histologically, there is epithelial elastotic degeneration of collagen, sometimes with particles of calcium.</p>
        <p class="h3">Corneal arcus</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal arcus, or <span class="italic">arcus senilis,</span> is most often an involutional change that is modified by genetic factors and caused by the deposition of lipid in the peripheral corneal stroma. Arcus starts at the inferior and superior poles of the cornea and, in the late stages, involves the entire circumference. The prevalence of corneal arcus is higher in African Americans and males. The arcus has a hazy white appearance, a sharp outer border, and an indistinct central border; it is denser superiorly and inferiorly (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-9</span>). A lucid interval is usually present between the peripheral edge of the arcus and the limbus. The lipid is found to be concentrated mainly in 2&#160;areas of the peripheral corneal stroma: one adjacent to the Bowman layer and another near the Descemet membrane.</p>
        <p class="body-text">In patients younger than 40&#160;years, the presence of arcus may be indicative of a hyperlipoproteinemia (involving low-&#173;density lipoproteins) with elevated serum cholesterol level (see Chapter&#160;8). Corneal arcus may also occur as a congenital anomaly <span class="italic">(arcus juvenilis).</span></p>
        <p class="body-text">Unilateral corneal arcus is a rare condition associated with contralateral carotid artery disease or ocular hypotony. Arcus is also seen in Schnyder corneal dystrophy and osteogenesis imperfecta.</p>
        <p class="h3">Crocodile shagreen</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anterior crocodile shagreen, or <span class="italic">mosaic degeneration,</span> is a bilateral, usually visually insignificant condition with a characteristic mosaic pattern. It consists of centrally located polygonal, gray opacities at the level of the Bowman layer that are separated by clear zones. Histologically, the Bowman layer is indented, forming ridges, and may be calcified. In posterior crocodile shagreen, there are similar changes in the deep stroma, near the Descemet membrane.</p>
        <p class="h3">Cornea farinata</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cornea farinata is an involutional change, most likely dominantly transmitted, in which the deep corneal stroma shows many subtle dotlike and comma-&#173;shaped opacities (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-10</span>). These opacities are often best seen in retroillumination. The opacities in pre-&#173;Descemet corneal dystrophy are similar but larger and more polymorphous. Confocal microscopy reveals highly reflective particles in the cytoplasm of keratocytes in the deep stroma, adjacent to the corneal endothelial layer. No abnormalities are detected in the epithelial layer, in the mid-&#173;stromal layer, at the level of the Descemet membrane, or in the endothelial layer. The deposits may consist of lipofuscin, a degenerative pigment that appears in some aging cells. The condition does not affect vision and has no clinical significance, except that it is sometimes mistaken for a progressive dystrophy.</p>
        <p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Polymorphic amyloid degeneration</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Polymorphic amyloid degeneration is a bilaterally symmetric, primarily axial, and slowly progressive corneal degeneration that appears late in life and is characterized by amyloid deposition. The deposits, which can resemble some of those seen in early lattice corneal dystrophy type&#160;3, form corneal opacities, appearing as stellate flecks in mid- to deep stroma and as irregular filaments. The opacities are gray to white and somewhat refractile, but they appear translucent in retroillumination (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-11</span>). The intervening stroma appears clear, and vision is usually normal. There is also an <span class="italic">acquired</span> (secondary localized) corneal amyloidosis; see Chapter 8 for a discussion of the amyloidoses.</p>
        <p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Senile furrow degeneration</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Senile furrow degeneration is seen in older patients with corneal arcus and refers to an appearance of peripheral thinning in the lucid interval of the arcus (see the section “Corneal arcus,” earlier in this chapter). Although slight thinning is occasionally present, it is usually more apparent than real. True thinning can eventually occur in the affected area and should be considered by the cataract surgeon, particularly with placement of the clear corneal incision, because of the risk of wound leak. The corneal epithelium is intact. There is no inflammation, vascularization, or potential for perforation. Vision is rarely affected, and no treatment is required.</p>
        <p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Terrien marginal degeneration</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Terrien marginal degeneration is a noninflammatory, slowly progressive thinning of the peripheral cornea. It is usually bilateral but can be very asymmetric. Although individuals of any age can be affected, this degeneration appears primarily in those older than 40&#160;years. Males and females are affected equally, with men affected slightly more frequently. The cause of this condition is unknown. Initially presenting in the superonasal area, the thinning spreads circumferentially; in rare cases, it involves the central cornea or inferior limbus. Affected patients are usually asymptomatic until the thinning results in increased astigmatism and subsequent reduction in vision.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The corneal epithelium remains intact, and a fine pannus traverses the area of stromal thinning. A line of lipid deposits appears at the leading edge of the pannus (central edge of the furrow) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-12</span>). Spontaneous perforation is rare, although it can easily occur with minor trauma. Ruptures in the Descemet membrane can result in acute corneal hydrops or even a corneal cyst. Corneal topography reveals flattening of the peripheral thinned cornea, with steepening of the corneal surface approximately 90° away from the midpoint of the thinned area. This pattern usually results in high against-&#173;the-rule or oblique astigmatism.</p>
        <p class="body-text">An inflammatory condition of the peripheral cornea that may resemble Terrien marginal degeneration occurs in rare instances in children and young adults and is also known as <span class="italic">Fuchs superficial marginal keratitis.</span> This condition may represent different clinical features of the same disease process.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Surgical correction is indicated when perforation is imminent because of progressive thinning, or when marked astigmatism significantly limits vision. Crescent-&#173;shaped lamellar or full-&#173;thickness corneoscleral patch grafts may be used; they have been reported to arrest the progression of severe against-&#173;the-rule astigmatism for up to 20&#160;years. Annular lamellar keratoplasty grafts may be required in severe cases of 360° marginal degeneration.</p>

        <p class="h3">Salzmann nodular degeneration</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Salzmann nodular degeneration is a noninflammatory corneal degeneration that sometimes occurs as a late sequela to long-&#173;standing keratitis such as phlyctenulosis, trachoma, and interstitial keratitis; it may also be idiopathic. The degeneration may not appear until years after the active keratitis has subsided. It can be bilateral and is more common in middle-&#173;aged and older women. The nodules are gray-white or blue-white and elevated (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-13</span>). They often develop in a roughly circular configuration in the central or paracentral cornea and at the ends of vessels of a pannus.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Histologic examination reveals localized replacement of the Bowman layer with hyaline and fibrillar material, probably representing basement membrane and material similar to that found in spheroidal degeneration (discussed earlier). Confocal microscopy reveals elongated basal epithelial cells and activated keratocytes in the anterior stroma, near the nodules; occasionally, subbasal nerves and tortuous stromal nerve bundles are also seen.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Treatment for mild cases is ocular lubrication; manual superficial keratectomy may be indicated in more severe cases (those causing decreased vision secondary to irregular astigmatism). This degeneration may recur after removal of the nodules.</p>
        <p class="body-text">A variant of Salzmann nodular degeneration, called <span class="italic">peripheral hypertrophic subepithelial corneal degeneration,</span> has been described. It is most common in women. Bilateral, fairly symmetric, peripheral, and hypertrophic subepithelial corneal opacification is present. Adjacent superficial limbal vascularization with occasional pseudopterygium has been noted (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-14</span>). Underlying chronic ocular surface inflammation is absent, and minimal relief of ocular irritation is achieved with topical corticosteroids.</p>

        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal keloids are superficial, sometimes protuberant, glistening, white corneal masses that can eventually involve the entire corneal surface. They are thought to be secondary to a vigorous fibrotic response to corneal injury or chronic ocular surface inflammation. Keloids can be congenital or primary, and they have been reported in association with many congenital conditions, such as Lowe disease (oculocerebrorenal syndrome). They have sometimes been confused with hypertrophic scars, Salzmann degeneration, or dermoids. Treatment of symptomatic patients may include superficial keratectomy or penetrating or lamellar keratoplasty.</p>

        <p class="h3">Lipid keratopathy</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">In lipid keratopathy, yellow or cream-colored lipids containing cholesterol, neutral fats, and glycoproteins are deposited in the superficial or deeper cornea, usually after prolonged corneal inflammation with scarring and corneal vascularization (eg, herpes simplex or herpes zoster keratitis, interstitial keratitis, including syphilitic). This form is best described as <span class="italic">secondary lipid keratopathy</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-15</span>). In rare instances, lipid keratopathy has been reported with no evidence of an antecedent infection, inflammatory process, or corneal damage. These cases are best described as <span class="italic">primary lipid keratopathy.</span> Treatment is indicated in cases of decreased vision or compromised cosmetic appearance. Lipid keratopathy should be distinguished from Schnyder corneal dystrophy, a rare autosomal dominant stromal dystrophy characterized by bilateral corneal opacification resulting from an abnormal accumulation of cholesterol and lipid. Controlling the neovascularization with topical corticosteroids may reduce or even stop progression of the keratopathy. Argon laser treatment with and without fluorescein, photodynamic therapy with verteporfin, and subconjunctival and topical bevacizumab have been reported to reduce corneal neovascularization and lipid deposition.</p>

        <p class="h3-h2">Iridocorneal endothelial syndrome</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome is a spectrum of disorders characterized by varying degrees of iris changes, pupillary anomalies, structural and proliferative abnormalities of the corneal endothelium, and peripheral anterior synechiae. Three clinical variants of ICE syndrome have been described in the literature. When the disease is confined to the inner corneal surface, corneal edema may occur as a result of subnormal endothelial pump function <span class="italic">(Chandler syndrome).</span> When the abnormal endothelium spreads onto the surface of the iris, the resulting contractile membrane may produce iris atrophy, corectopia, and polycoria—hallmarks of <span class="italic">essential (progressive) iris atrophy</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-16</span>). The third variant, <span class="italic">Cogan-&#173;Reese syndrome (iris nevus syndrome)</span> is characterized by the presence of multiple pigmented iris nodules, which are also produced by the contracting endothelial membrane. The syndrome occurs most commonly in middle-&#173;aged women and is almost always unilateral.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The pathogenesis of ICE syndrome is unknown but appears to involve abnormal cloning of endothelial cells, which take on the ultrastructural characteristics of epithelial cells (“ICE cells”). It is not clear when the abnormal cloning occurs, however. Herpesvirus may be causative, as viral DNA has been identified in some corneal biopsy specimens following keratoplasty and in the aqueous humor of some ICE patients. ICE cells seen with specular microscopy are typically abnormal, large, rounded, and pleomorphic. They show a characteristic reversal of the normal “light-dark” pattern; thus, the surface appears dark with an occasional central light spot, and the intercellular borders appear light. In vivo confocal microscopy shows ICE cells to be pleomorphic epithelial-&#173;like endothelial cells with hyperreflective nuclei and cell borders that appear brighter than cell surfaces.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Varying degrees of progressive endothelialization take place in the cornea, in the anterior chamber angle, and on the iris surface. Gonioscopy demonstrates broad-based iridotrabecular synechiae, which are due to the proliferation and migration of abnormal endothelium over the anterior chamber angle and which result in outflow obstruction and secondary glaucoma. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is useful for detecting changes in angle structures in ICE syndrome, especially in the presence of corneal edema that does not allow visualization with gonioscopy.</p>
        <p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of ICE syndrome should include asymmetric posterior polymorphous dystrophy and other causes of unilateral corneal edema.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Treatment options for the corneal component of this syndrome are penetrating keratoplasty and endothelial keratoplasty. Treatment of the glaucoma can be challenging, as filtering surgery may fail because of the progressive growth of the abnormal endothelial membrane extending over the trabecular meshwork and filtration site. Implanted tube shunts may overcome regrowth of the membrane in the filtration site. Long-term graft clarity depends on the successful control of intraocular pressure, which can be difficult (see BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma</span>). Definitive keratoprosthesis may be an alternative to repeated traditional keratoplasty.</p>

        <p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Peripheral cornea guttae</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Peripheral cornea guttae (Hassall-&#173;Henle bodies) are small wartlike excrescences that appear in the peripheral portion of the Descemet membrane. A normal change with aging, they result from thickening of the Descemet membrane, which takes place throughout life, and occur on the posterior part of the membrane, protruding toward the anterior chamber. With the slit lamp, Hassall-&#173;Henle bodies have the appearance of small, dark dimples within the endothelial mosaic; these are best seen by specular reflection. Rarely seen before age 20&#160;years, Hassall-&#173;Henle bodies then increase steadily in number with age. When they appear in the central cornea, they are pathologic and are called <span class="italic">cornea guttae.</span> Central cornea guttae associated with progressive stromal and eventually epithelial edema represent Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (see Chapter&#160;7).</p>
        <p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Melanin pigmentation</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Deposits of melanin on the corneal endothelium can be seen in patients with glaucoma associated with pigment dispersion syndrome. The cluster of vertically oriented spindle-&#173;shaped pigment deposits is usually referred to as <span class="italic">Krukenberg spindle</span> (see Table&#160;6-3). Transillumination defects in the midperipheral iris can also be seen.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="h1 ParaOverride-11">Degenerations of the Sclera</p>
    <div id="Chapt6_Top4">
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The sclera becomes less elastic with age, and there is a relative decrease in scleral hydration and the amount of mucopolysaccharide. These changes are accompanied by subconjunctival deposition of fat, which gives the sclera a yellowish appearance. Calcium may also be deposited either diffusely among the scleral collagen fibers in granular or crystalline form or focally in a plaque anterior to the horizontal rectus muscle insertions. This senile plaque <span class="italic">(Cogan plaque)</span> is visible as an ovoid or rectangular zone of grayish translucency (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-17</span>) and is sometimes mistaken for a pigmented tumor. Histologically, the mid&#173;portion of the involved sclera contains a focal calcified plaque surrounded by relatively acellular collagen. These plaques do not elicit inflammation and rarely extrude. If sufficiently dense, they may be visualized on a computed tomography scan.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="h1">Drug-Induced Deposition and Pigmentation</p>
    <<div id="Chapt6_Top5">
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular medications deposit within the cornea as a result of their concentration within the tear film, limbal vasculature, or aqueous humor or because of their chemical properties’ specific affinity to corneal tissue. Certain drugs deposit in a characteristic fashion and particular corneal layer. The deposition of the drug may reduce vision, induce photosensitivity, or cause ocular irritation. Cessation of the drug often eliminates the symptoms and resolves the drug deposits. Most drug-&#173;induced deposition is not symptomatic, however, and does not require cessation of the medication (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-4</span>).</p>
        <p class="h2">Corneal Epithelial Deposits</p>
        <p class="h3-h2">Cornea verticillata</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cornea verticillata, or <span class="italic">vortex keratopathy,</span> manifests as a clockwise whorl-like pattern of golden-&#173;brown or gray deposits in the inferior interpalpebral portion of the cornea (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-18</span>). A variety of medications bind with the cellular lipids of the basal epithelial layer of the cornea because of their cationic, amphiphilic properties. Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug, is the most common cause of cornea verticillata, followed by chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, indomethacin, and the phenothiazines (eg, chlorpromazine). See Table&#160;6-4 for a comprehensive list of systemic drugs associated with cornea verticillata.</p>
        <p class="body-text">It is unusual for these deposits to result in reduced vision or ocular symptoms, although this has occurred in some patients. The deposits typically resolve with discontinuation of the responsible drugs. If there is reduced vision with the use of amiodarone or tamoxifen, the possibility of optic neuropathy should be considered. Retinal toxicity associated with the use of drugs belonging to the aminoquinoline family can also reduce vision (see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> for further discussion of retinal toxicity). The differential diagnosis of cornea verticillata should also include Fabry disease, a disorder of sphingolipid metabolism.</p>
        <p class="h3">Epithelial cysts</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Due to the rapid turnover of epithelial cells, drugs that inhibit DNA synthesis may be toxic to the epithelium when used in high doses systemically. Cytarabine, for example, may cause punctate keratopathy and refractile epithelial microcysts, which are associated with pain, photophobia, foreign-&#173;body sensation, and reduced vision.</p>
        <p class="h3">Ciprofloxacin deposits</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Therapy with topical ciprofloxacin (and, less often, other fluoroquinolones) can result in the deposition of a chalky white precipitate composed of ciprofloxacin crystals within an epithelial defect (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-19</span>). Although white plaques predominate, a crystalline pattern may also be seen. The deposits resolve after discontinuation of the medication.</p>
        <p class="h3">Adrenochrome deposits</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Long-term administration of epinephrine compounds, tetracycline, or minocycline may lead to adrenochrome deposition in the conjunctiva and cornea. Adrenochrome is an oxidation product of the basic epinephrine compound. The black or very dark-brown melanin-&#173;like deposits can accumulate in conjunctival cysts and concretions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-20</span>) and may also discolor the cornea or contact lenses. The deposits are harmless but are occasionally misdiagnosed as conjunctival melanoma or other conditions.</p>

        <p class="h2">Stromal and Descemet Membrane Pigmentation</p>
        <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chlorpromazine, a member of the phenothiazine family, may cause corneal pigmentation in up to a third of patients on long-term chlorpromazine therapy. It probably enters the cornea through the aqueous; therefore, the brown opacities are first found in the <br />posterior stroma, Descemet membrane, and endothelium. The drug later spreads to <br />the anterior stroma and epithelium. Chlorpromazine can also deposit on the anterior lens capsule. Clofazimine may produce anterior stromal opacities or crystalline deposits. Isotretinoin is typically associated with fine, diffuse, gray deposits in the central and peripheral cornea.</p>
        <p class="body-text">Certain classes of metallic compounds can produce characteristic deep stromal or Descemet opacities. Long-term use of silver compounds, which were commonly used in the preantibiotic era to treat external infections, can result in a condition known as <span class="italic">argyriasis,</span> a potentially permanent slate-gray or silver discoloration of the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva. Silver nitrate, which is applied to the bulbar conjunctiva in the treatment of superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, can also cause argyriasis if this compound is applied excessively. Gold salts are one of the drugs that can be used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. With long-term usage and cumulative doses exceeding 1&#160;g, posterior stromal deposits that spare the Descemet membrane and corneal endothelium develop in a high percentage of patients. See Table&#160;6-3 for a list of corneal deposits that may be of diagnostic importance.</p>
