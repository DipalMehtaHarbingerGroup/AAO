			<p class="h1">Chemical Injuries</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chemical injuries to the external eye can range in severity from mild irritation to complete destruction of the ocular surface and adnexa (eyelids), resulting in corneal opacification, loss of vision, and even loss of the eye. Chemical injuries may occur in the home or workplace. Some of the most severe ocular chemical injuries are caused by strong alkalis (eg, lye) or acids used for assault. <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;14-1</span> lists some common caustic chemicals that can cause ocular injury.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Whenever possible, the offending chemical agent should be identified. The severity of a chemical injury depends on the pH (acid or alkali), the volume and duration of contact, and the inherent toxicity of the chemical. Frequently, the container of the toxic agent offers instructions for treatment or a phone number to call for detailed assistance.</p>
			<p class="h2">Alkali Burns</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most severe chemical injuries occur with alkaline (high pH) solutions because they cause saponification of fatty acids in cell membranes and ultimately cellular disruption. Once the surface epithelium is damaged, alkaline solutions readily penetrate the corneal stroma, where they rapidly destroy the proteoglycan ground substance and collagen fibers of the stromal matrix. Strong alkaline substances may also penetrate through the endothelium into the anterior chamber, causing severe tissue damage and intense inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The visual prognosis is often determined by the extent of ocular surface injury and the effect of skin burns on eyelid function. There are multiple classification and grading schemes for chemical injuries. The Hughes classification scheme (as modified by Thoft) divides chemical injuries of the cornea into 4&#160;categories (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;14-2</span>) based on clinical findings. The scheme shown in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;14-3</span> establishes the grade of injury based on clinical signs, symptoms, and expected outcomes. The most unfavorable visual prognosis is associated with extensive limbal epithelial damage. The limbus contains corneal epithelial stem cells; damage to this region can lead to disruption in the cells repopulating the corneal epithelium. Blanching occurs when the vascular supply to this critical area is disrupted via death of vascular endothelial cells in the conjunctiva. The resultant limbal and anterior segment ischemia is a poor prognostic feature for eyes thus affected (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;14-1</span> through <span class="xref-figure">14-4</span>). If the conjunctiva recovers, vascularization may occur (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-5</span>). Repopulation of the corneal surface epithelium with undifferentiated conjunctival cells leads to poor epithelial adhesion and recurrent breakdown, and possibly chronic inflammation if the original trauma is severe. Intraocular chemical penetration may result in cataract formation and secondary glaucoma; the latter is thought to result from damage to the trabecular meshwork, which can affect outflow facility.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with severe alkali burns are fortunate if the conjunctival and corneal surface vascularize and stabilize. Patients with alkali burns may not be candidates for penetrating keratoplasty because the loss of goblet cells impairs graft survival, but they may be candidates for limbal stem cell transplantation followed by keratoplasty or keratoprosthesis. In the most severe cases, phthisis of the globe may occur or, in the absence of vascularization, melting may lead to enucleation.</p>

			<p class="h2">Acid Burns</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acid solutions with very low pH tend to cause less severe tissue damage than do alkaline solutions because acids denature and precipitate proteins in the tissues they contact, forming a barrier to penetration. Mild acid burns can cause an epithelial defect (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-6</span>). Acid burns can cause severe damage to the ocular surface, but compared with alkali burns, there is a lower chance of corneal melting or penetration of the solution into the anterior chamber. The exception to diminished penetration is a hydrofluoric acid burn, which can cause significant anterior segment destruction. Acid burns do not directly cause loss of the proteoglycan ground substance in the cornea, although they can incite severe inflammation and damage to the corneal matrix and result in corneal opacification (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-7</span>) or symblepharon formation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Management of Chemical Injuries</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most important step in the management of chemical injuries is immediate and copious irrigation of the ocular surface with water or balanced saline solution. If these liquids are not available, the clinician may use any other pure, nontoxic solution to rinse the ocular surface and dilute the offending agent. Alkali burns are true emergencies, and irrigation should be initiated at the site of the chemical injury and continued until an ophthalmologist evaluates the patient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The eyelid can be opened with a retractor or eyelid speculum, and topical anesthetic should be instilled. Irrigation may be accomplished using handheld intravenous tubing, an irrigating eyelid speculum, or a special scleral contact lens that connects to intravenous tubing. Irrigation should continue until the pH of the conjunctival sac normalizes. The conjunctival pH should be checked with a urinary pH strip. If this strip is not available, it is better to overtreat with prolonged periods of irrigation than to assume that the pH has normalized and discontinue treatment too early.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because prolonged exposure to toxic particles can exacerbate chemical damage to the ocular surface, particulate chemicals should be removed from the ocular surface with cotton-&#173;tipped applicators and forceps. Eversion of the upper eyelid should be performed to search for material in the upper fornix (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-9</span>), and the fornices should be swept with an applicator to ensure that no particulate matter remains in the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Management over the next few days, the <span class="italic">intermediate period,</span> should aim to decrease inflammation, monitor intraocular pressure (IOP), limit matrix degradation, and promote reepithelialization of the cornea. Many of the following recommendations for management are based on animal models of acute alkaline injury.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An intense polymorphonucleocyte (PMN) infiltration of the corneal stroma can occur following acute alkali burns. PMNs deliver proteolytic enzymes that, in the absence of an intact epithelium, dissolve corneal stromal collagen and ground substance. Corticosteroids are excellent inhibitors of PMN function, and intensive treatment with a topical corticosteroid is recommended for 10–14&#160;days following a chemical injury. Thereafter, the frequency of the corticosteroid drops should be markedly reduced to prevent inhibition of wound healing and exacerbation of stromal melting. Corticosteroids retard epithelial wound healing and increase the risk of secondary infection by inhibiting normal ocular surface immune defense mechanisms, so their adverse effects in the chronic phase probably exceed their beneficial effects.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A deficiency of calcium in the plasma membrane of PMNs inhibits their ability to degranulate. Both tetracycline and citric acid are potent chelators of extracellular calcium. Therefore, oral tetracyclines and topical sodium citrate 10% have theoretical benefits for inhibiting PMN-&#173;induced collagenolysis. Topical medroxyprogesterone 1% may be effective in suppressing collagen breakdown and is used at some centers. Use of topical cycloplegics should be initiated and may be continued for patients with discomfort or significant anterior chamber reaction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the early stage of a chemical injury, there may be a rise in IOP, which can be controlled by use of oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in order to avoid toxicity from topical glaucoma medications. However, if the corneal epithelium is healing normally, topical therapies may be used as well. See BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> for a detailed discussion of medications used to control IOP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Measures that promote wound healing and inhibit collagenolytic activity prevent stromal ulceration. Severe alkali burns in rabbit eyes reduce aqueous humor ascorbate levels to one-third of normal levels. Reduced aqueous humor ascorbate has been correlated with corneal stromal ulceration and perforation. Systemic administration of ascorbic acid to rabbits with acute corneal alkaline injuries restores the level of aqueous humor ascorbate to normal and significantly reduces the incidence of ulceration. High-dose ascorbic acid is believed to promote collagen synthesis in the alkali-&#173;burned eye, given that ascorbic acid is required as a cofactor for collagen synthesis. Currently, there is no widely accepted standard for administration of ascorbic acid after chemical injury, but some recommend that patients take 1–2&#160;g of vitamin&#160;C per day. Because this therapy is potentially toxic to the kidneys, ascorbic acid should not be administered to patients with compromised renal function.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Frequent use of nonpreserved topical lubricants helps facilitate epithelial healing in the acute and chronic stages of chemical injury. Necrotic corneal epithelium should be debrided to minimize the release of inflammatory mediators from damaged epithelial cells and to promote reepithelialization. A bandage contact lens may be beneficial for protecting ocular surface epithelium once migration onto the peripheral cornea has begun; however, acute conjunctival swelling and inflammation or late symblepharon formation may prevent retention of the contact lens. A temporary or permanent tarsorrhaphy facilitates reepithelialization due to increased corneal coverage, but as with contact lens use, the drawback is the increased risk of infection in eyes with compromised defense mechanisms. Avascular sclera usually does not epithelialize until revascularization occurs. If scleral melting occurs, a rotational graft of tarsoconjunctival tissue from the adjacent eyelid can be performed to promote revascularization.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Autologous conjunctival or limbal stem cell transplantation using tissue from the patient’s uninjured eye may facilitate healing of the corneal epithelial defect. Amniotic membrane may be helpful in suppressing inflammation, promoting reepithelialization, and preventing symblepharon formation; this option should be considered 1–2&#160;weeks after injury. Limbal stem cell transplantation may be performed as soon as 2&#160;weeks after chemical injury if no signs of corneal epithelialization have appeared. However, the prognosis of limbal grafts is better when the eye is not very inflamed; therefore, it is preferable to wait until the acute inflammation has subsided. A new technique known as <span class="italic">simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET)</span> combines limbal stem cell transplantation with use of amniotic membrane (see Chapter&#160;13). If there is damage to the conjunctiva of both eyes, then either amniotic membrane alone or oral mucosal grafts may be necessary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The long-term prognosis for a corneal transplant is improved if the ocular surface inflammation has resolved either over time (months to years) or after limbal stem cell grafting (ocular surface reconstruction), if necessary. Even when there is no active ocular surface inflammation, stromal vascularization in the host bed is associated with a much higher risk of rejection in these keratoplasty cases. Keratoprosthesis is another surgical option for these patients, but again, the prognosis is best when the inflammation has been brought under control.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Injuries Caused by Temperature and Radiation</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Thermal Burns</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Heat</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Heat is a primary cause of inflammation and stromal protease expression and can lead to collagen melting if severe. Rapid-&#173;reflex eyelid closure, Bell phenomenon, and reflex movement away from the source of intense heat usually limit damage to the globe from flames. Burns from molten metal that stays in contact with the eye are more likely to cause corneal injuries that result in permanent scarring.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Curling irons, cigarettes, and hot liquids splashing into the eye, especially during cooking, are common household causes of corneal burns (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-10</span>). These burns are usually limited to the epithelium and generally require only a brief period of antibiotic and cycloplegic therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular electrical injury may be caused by heat or electric current. Electric current can eventually cause corneal epithelial erosion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The primary objectives of therapy for burns caused by heat are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">relieve discomfort</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">prevent secondary corneal inflammation, ulceration, and perforation from infection or from exposure caused by eyelid damage</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">minimize eyelid scarring and resultant malfunction</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A cycloplegic agent can help relieve discomfort from ciliary spasm or iridocyclitis. Prophylactic antibiotics (topical and/or systemic) can help prevent infection of burned eyelids and/or reduce the chances of infectious corneal ulceration. Limited debridement of devitalized tissues and granulation tissue, used with full-&#173;thickness skin grafts and tarsorrhaphy, helps minimize eyelid scarring and ectropion. Burned ocular tissue can be protected temporarily by covering the eye with a lubricant and a piece of sterile plastic wrap. Topical corticosteroids help suppress any associated iridocyclitis, but they can also inhibit corneal wound healing and must be used with caution and, in general, for short periods.</p>
			<p class="h3">Freezing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Transient corneal stromal edema induced by cold has been reported in a variety of settings, including prolonged exposure to cold when skiing or mountain climbing. Cold temperatures adversely affect the Na<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-ATPase pump function of the endothelial cells and render it less effective. Individuals with Raynaud disease and those with cranial nerve&#160;V (trigeminal) dysfunction may be especially susceptible. Research suggests that sensory denervation of the eye increases the susceptibility of the endothelium to cold temperatures.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ultraviolet Radiation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The corneal epithelium is susceptible to injury from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, both naturally occurring and artificial. The most common causes of UV-&#173;radiation injury to the eye are unprotected exposure to sunlamps or tanning beds, and arc welding. Prolonged outdoor exposure to reflected sunlight, or <span class="italic">snow blindness,</span> occurs in skiers and mountain climbers at high elevations, where there is less atmospheric diffraction of UV radiation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with ocular UV-&#173;radiation injuries present with eyelid edema, conjunctival hyperemia, and diffuse punctate keratitis. Treatment consists of patching to minimize discomfort from eyelid movement, use of a topical antibiotic ointment, and cycloplegia. If discomfort is severe, patients may require oral analgesics. Complete epithelial healing usually occurs within 24–72&#160;hours. Appropriate protection with UV-&#173;filtering glasses can prevent most such injuries.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Ionizing Radiation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Exposure to ionizing radiation may occur with UV light, x-rays, gamma rays, medical imaging equipment, nuclear explosions, and radioisotopes. The level of exposure is related to the amount of energy in the ionizing radiation, the type of rays emitted, the duration of exposure, and the patient’s proximity to the ionizing source. Tissue destruction may result from direct killing of cells, cellular DNA changes that produce lethal or other mutations, or radiation damage to blood vessels with secondary ischemic necrosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ionizing radiation can damage the conjunctiva, cornea, and occasionally the lacrimal glands. Conjunctival edema occurs acutely, often followed by scarring, shrinkage, loss of tear production, and alterations in conjunctival blood vessels with telangiectasia. Necrosis of the conjunctiva and underlying sclera can occur if radioactive material (or a radiomimetic agent such as mitomycin&#160;C) is embedded in the conjunctiva. Punctate corneal epithelial erosions are noted acutely. Explosions involving ionizing radiation may lead to perforation of ocular tissues with immediate radiation necrosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The first step in management of acute radiation injury is removal of all foreign bodies. Poor wound healing is a hallmark of ionizing radiation injuries. Late complications are related to decreased tear production, loss of corneal sensation, sloughing of corneal epithelial cells, and failure of the cornea to heal. Secondary microbial keratitis, vascularization, and ocular surface disease can result from dry eyes and compromised epithelial cells. The use of artificial tears or a bandage contact lens may help stabilize the ocular surface in mild cases. More severe cases may require tarsorrhaphy and/or tissue adhesive. If there is recurrent epithelial breakdown despite these measures, significant conjunctival scarring typically precludes the use of a conjunctival flap from that eye. If the fellow eye has not been injured, a contralateral autologous conjunctival flap may be helpful. Alternatively, an amniotic membrane transplant, limbal stem cell transplant, or mucous membrane graft may be employed. The visual prognosis associated with penetrating keratoplasty or limbal stem cell transplantation in these situations is guarded because of the severely compromised ocular surface.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Injuries Caused by Animal and Plant Substances</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Insect and Arachnid Injuries</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Bee and wasp stings to the cornea and/or conjunctiva cause conjunctival hyperemia and chemosis acutely, sometimes associated with severe pain, corneal edema, and infiltration, with subsequent decreased vision. The significant variability in the acute response is thought to reflect differences in the quantity of the venom injected and whether the reaction to the venom is primarily toxic or immunologic. In rare instances, other sequelae have been documented, including hyphema, lenticular opacities, anterior uveitis, secondary glaucoma, and heterochromia. Initial therapy with cycloplegics and topical (and occasionally systemic) corticosteroids is beneficial. Removal of externalized stingers may be attempted. After the acute episode, retained stingers may remain inert in the cornea for years. Caterpillar and tarantula hairs (urticating hairs) may also become embedded in the cornea and conjunctiva. These hairs are very fine and usually cannot be removed manually. Because of their structure, these urticating hairs tend to migrate more deeply into ocular tissues and elicit a localized granulomatous inflammatory response <span class="italic">(ophthalmia nodosum).</span> In these cases, the patient will have an extreme foreign-&#173;body sensation until the hairs migrate below the corneal surface. Inflammatory sequelae usually respond to topical corticosteroids.</p>

			<p class="h2">Vegetative Injuries</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular contact with the milky sap (latex) from a variety of trees can cause toxic reactions manifested by acute keratoconjunctivitis, epithelial defects, and stromal infiltration. The pencil tree and the manchineel tree, widely distributed in tropical regions, are known offenders. Houseplants in the genus <span class="italic">Dieffenbachia</span> are known to cause keratoconjunctivitis from calcium oxalate crystals in the cornea; crunching the leaves can cause these crystals to shoot into the cornea. The crystals cause a foreign-&#173;body sensation and are difficult to see on slit-lamp examination; the diagnosis of <span class="italic">Dieffenbachia</span> keratitis is made from the history as much as anything else. Corneal foreign bodies from coconut shell, sunflower stalk, and ornamental cactus have also been documented.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Initial management of injuries caused by all such plant materials should include irrigation and removal of foreign bodies when possible and administration of topical cycloplegics with prophylactic antibiotic coverage, as indicated by the clinical situation. Corticosteroids are best avoided, as they suppress immunity to microbes in general and may promote fungal infection specifically, which is of concern in all cases involving vegetable matter because plant sources are common causes of fungal keratitis. Surgical removal of vegetative foreign bodies should be attempted in order to mitigate the inflammatory response or associated secondary microbial infections. If a patient with a severe injury from plant sources fails to improve after supportive therapy, the possibility of bacterial or fungal infection should be considered and appropriate workup (including culturing and/or biopsy) performed. For additional discussion of microbial keratitis, see Chapter&#160;10.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Concussive (Blunt) Trauma</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Subconjunctival Hemorrhage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A subconjunctival hemorrhage is blood beneath the conjunctiva, with an alarming bright red appearance against the white sclera below (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-11</span>). Patients with subconjunctival hemorrhage typically have no history of antecedent trauma. When trauma has occurred, damage to deeper structures of the eye (ie, eye perforation when there is massive and raised hemorrhage) must be ruled out. Subconjunctival hemorrhage is usually not associated with an underlying systemic disease and rarely has an identifiable cause. Occasionally, a history of vomiting, coughing, or other forms of the Valsalva maneuver can be elicited. Patients may be taking a medication that impedes clotting.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Typically, no therapy is necessary for the hemorrhage, as it usually resolves in 7–12&#160;days, and the patient simply requires reassurance that the condition is not serious. If the hemorrhage elevates the limbal conjunctiva off of the cornea, corneal dellen may occur. Patients should be warned that the hemorrhage can spread around the circumference of the globe before it resolves and that it may change in color from red to yellow during its dissolution.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Repeated episodes of spontaneous subconjunctival hemorrhage may indicate a possible bleeding diathesis (eg, easy bruising, frequent bloody nose), and a careful systemic medical evaluation may be warranted. Recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhages can be seen in association with uncontrolled hypertension; diabetes mellitus; systemic blood disorders; and use of antiplatelet (aspirin), anticoagulant (heparin or warfarin), and thrombolytic (streptokinase) drugs.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Corneal Changes From Blunt Trauma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blunt trauma to the cornea can result in abrasions, edema, tears in the Descemet membrane (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-12</span>), and corneoscleral lacerations, usually located at the limbus. Traumatic posterior annular keratopathy or corneal endothelial rings have also been described; these rings are whitish gray and occur directly posterior to the traumatic impact. The endothelial rings appear within several hours of a contusive injury and usually disappear within a few days.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Traumatic Mydriasis and Miosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Traumatic mydriasis results from iris sphincter tears that can permanently dilate or otherwise alter the shape of the pupil (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-13</span>). The iris tears may result in a hyphema. The pupil changes are generally permanent; patients should use sunglasses for resultant photophobia, as permanent surgical repair is less effective.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Miosis tends to be associated with anterior chamber inflammation (<span class="italic">traumatic anterior uveitis;</span> see the following section). Topical corticosteroid drops to reduce inflammation and cycloplegia to prevent formation of posterior synechiae are helpful in controlling symptoms.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Traumatic Anterior Uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The inflammation present in traumatic anterior uveitis is often associated with decreased vision and perilimbal conjunctival hyperemia. Photophobia, tearing, and ocular pain may occur within 24&#160;hours of injury. The anterior chamber reaction can be surprisingly minimal to cause symptoms of pain and photophobia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment consists of a topical cycloplegic agent to relieve patient discomfort, as well as topical corticosteroid drops if significant inflammation is present. Once the anterior uveitis has diminished, cycloplegia may be discontinued, and topical corticosteroids should be tapered slowly to prevent rebound anterior uveitis. See BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for a more detailed discussion of uveitis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Iridodialysis and Cyclodialysis</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Iridodialysis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blunt trauma may cause <span class="italic">iridodialysis,</span> or traumatic separation of the iris root from the ciliary body (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-14</span>). Anterior segment hemorrhage often ensues, and the iridodialysis may not be recognized until the hyphema has cleared. A small iridodialysis requires no treatment. A large iridodialysis may cause polycoria, polyopia, and monocular diplopia, requiring surgical repair (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;14-15, 14-16</span>) (see Surgical Management later in the chapter). If possible, the iridodialysis should be repaired within a few weeks of the injury, because prolonged contracture of the radial iris fibers may prevent a round pupil after normal iris anatomy is reestablished.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Cyclodialysis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Traumatic cyclodialysis is characterized by separation of the ciliary body from its attachment to the scleral spur, resulting in a cleft. A hyphema may result from the tearing of the tissue. Gonioscopically, this cleft appears as a gap at the posterior edge of the scleral spur from posterior displacement of the ciliary body band. Sclera may be visible through the gap. Ultrasound biomicroscopy can be useful in identifying the location and extent of the cyclodialysis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-17</span>). A cyclodialysis cleft can cause increased uveoscleral outflow, leading to chronic hypotony, and macular edema. If treatment with topical cycloplegics does not suffice, closure may be attempted using an argon laser, diathermy, cryotherapy, or direct suturing. If repair is necessary, it should be performed after resolution of the hyphema.</p>
			<p class="h2">Traumatic Hyphema</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Traumatic hyphema occurs most commonly in young men, as this demographic experiences more ocular trauma than any other. Trauma causes posterior displacement of the lens–iris interface with equatorial scleral expansion. The increase in equatorial diameter stretches the major iris arterial circle, arterial branches of the ciliary body, and/or recurrent choroidal arteries and veins. The hyphema results from injury to the vessels of the peripheral iris, iris sphincter, or anterior ciliary body (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-18</span>). The bleeding may be so subtle that it can be detected only as a few circulating red blood cells on slit-lamp examination (microscopic hyphema; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-19</span>), or it may form a clot in the anterior chamber (layered hyphema; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-20</span>). Alternatively, the bleeding may be severe enough to fill the anterior chamber completely. The prognosis for traumatic hyphema is generally good and is independent of the size of the hyphema, as long as no additional complications are present. Even <span class="italic">total,</span> or <span class="italic">eight-ball, hyphemas</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-21</span>) can resolve without sequelae. Traumatic hyphema is frequently associated with corneal abrasion, anterior uveitis, and mydriasis, as well as with simultaneous injuries to the angle structures, lens, posterior segment, and orbit.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Spontaneous hyphema</span> (ie, a hyphema that occurs without any history of trauma) is much less common and should alert the examiner to the possibility of rubeosis iridis (mainly central retinal vein obstruction and diabetic retinopathy), clotting abnormalities, herpetic disease, or intraocular lens (IOL) problems. Juvenile xanthogranuloma, retinoblastoma, iris vascular hamartomas, and leukemia are associated with spontaneous hyphema in children.</p>
			<p class="h3">Rebleeding</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The major concern after a traumatic hyphema is rebleeding, which is seen in less than 5% of cases. Rebleeding usually occurs between 3 and 7&#160;days after injury as a result of clot lysis and retraction. A complication associated with rebleeding is elevated IOP (seen in 50% of patients), which can potentially lead to glaucoma and optic atrophy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The combination of elevated IOP, corneal endothelial damage, and blood in the anterior chamber can result in corneal blood staining (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-22A</span>). Red blood cells within the anterior chamber release hemoglobin that penetrates the posterior corneal stroma, where it is absorbed by keratocytes. Within the keratocytes, breakdown of the hemoglobin into hemosiderin can result in the death of the keratocytes. It may be difficult to detect when blood is in apposition to the endothelium on slit-lamp examination; however, close observation reveals early blood staining as yellow granular changes and reduced fibrillar definition in the posterior corneal stroma. Blood staining can lead to a reduction in corneal transparency that may be permanent. Histologically, red blood cells and their breakdown products can be seen within the corneal stroma. Corneal blood staining often clears slowly, starting in the periphery (Fig&#160;14-22B).</p>
			<p class="h3">Medical management of traumatic hyphema</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The treatment plan for traumatic hyphema should be directed at minimizing the possibility of secondary hemorrhage, controlling inflammation, and mitigating elevated IOP. It is essential that the patient wear a protective shield over the injured eye; restrict physical activity; elevate the head of the bed; and be observed closely, with daily observation initially. To reduce the risk of rebleeding, nonaspirin analgesics should be used for pain relief; however, even nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory medications can increase the risk of rebleeding. Most patients can be managed on an outpatient basis, but if satisfactory home care and outpatient observation cannot be ensured, admission to the hospital may be required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most ophthalmologists administer long-&#173;acting topical cycloplegic agents initially to control inflammation and improve patient comfort, facilitate posterior segment evaluation, and eliminate iris movement. Topical corticosteroids are beneficial in controlling anterior chamber inflammation and preventing synechiae formation, and they may play a role in preventing rebleeding. Oral corticosteroids are controversial in the treatment of hyphema but may be used to facilitate the resolution of severe inflammation and/or to prevent rebleeding.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aggressive treatment of elevated IOP is important to reduce the risk of corneal blood staining and optic atrophy. Topical antihypertensive agents (<span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers and <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-agonists) are the mainstay of therapy, although intravenous or oral hyperosmotic agents may occasionally be required. If medical management fails to control IOP, surgical evacuation of the blood may be required in order to reduce the risk of permanent corneal blood staining.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Antifibrinolytic agents (eg, aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, prednisone) were previously thought to reduce the incidence of rebleeding, but studies have shown no statistical improvement in visual outcome. Because these agents can have significant adverse effects (eg, nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension, muscle cramps, conjunctival suffusion, nasal stuffiness, headache, rash, pruritus, dyspnea, toxic confusional states, and arrhythmias), they are rarely used today in the treatment of hyphema.</p>

			<p class="h3">Surgical intervention in traumatic hyphema</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Surgery should be performed at the earliest definitive detection of corneal blood staining. Some authors suggest that surgery is indicated when IOP is higher than 25&#160;mm Hg on average for 5&#160;days with a total hyphema or when IOP is higher than 60&#160;mm Hg for 2&#160;days. Patients with preexisting optic nerve damage or sickle cell hemoglobinopathies may require earlier intervention. Indications for surgical intervention are summarized in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;14-4</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The simplest way to surgically treat a persistent anterior chamber clot is anterior chamber irrigation with balanced salt solution through a limbal paracentesis. The goal is to remove circulating red blood cells that may obstruct the trabecular meshwork; removal of the entire clot is neither necessary nor wise because of the risk of a secondary hemorrhage. The irrigation procedure can be repeated. If irrigation is not successful, the irrigation/aspiration handpiece, used in cataract surgery, may be effective. The use of a cutting instrument or intraocular diathermy may be necessary in severe cases. Iris damage, lens injury, endothelial cell trauma, and additional bleeding are potentially serious complications of surgical intervention.</p>
			<p class="h3">Sickle cell complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When a traumatic hyphema develops in an African American patient, a sickle cell workup should be performed to investigate the possibility of sickle cell hemoglobinopathy. Patients with sickle cell disease and carriers of the sickle cell trait are predisposed to sickling of red blood cells in the anterior chamber. Because sickle cells have restricted outflow through the trabecular meshwork, they may raise IOP dramatically. In addition, the optic nerve seems to be at greater risk of damage in patients with sickle cell disease, even those with modest IOP elevation, presumably as a result of a decrease in blood flow to the optic nerve.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinician must make every effort to control elevated IOP in these patients. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and osmotic agents reduce aqueous pH and lead to hemoconcentration, both of which may exacerbate sickling of red blood cells. For this reason, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors should be avoided in sickle cell patients. Surgical intervention is recommended if average IOP remains 25&#160;mm Hg or higher after the first 24&#160;hours or if there are repeated, transient elevations, with IOP higher than 30&#160;mm Hg for 2–4&#160;days, despite medical intervention.</p>

			<p class="h1">Penetrating and Perforating Ocular Trauma</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is important to understand the difference between a penetrating wound and a perforating wound for accurate communication and documentation. In a <span class="italic">penetrating</span> wound, a foreign body passes into an anatomical structure; in a <span class="italic">perforating</span> wound, a foreign body passes through such a structure. In a penetrating corneal injury, an object enters but does not pass all the way through the cornea, as in the case of a metallic foreign body that enters the corneal stroma but lodges anterior to the Descemet membrane. In a perforating corneal injury, an object passes through the cornea and lodges in the anterior chamber. A perforating corneal foreign-&#173;body injury can also be called a <span class="italic">penetrating ocular</span> foreign-&#173;body injury if the foreign body passes through the cornea but does not exit through the globe. In a <span class="italic">perforating ocular</span> injury, the foreign body enters and exits the globe.</p>
			<p class="h2">Conjunctival Laceration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When managing conjunctival lacerations associated with trauma, the physician must be certain that the deeper structures of the eye have not been damaged and that no foreign body is present. After a topical anesthetic has been applied, the conjunctival laceration should be explored under slit-lamp examination using sterile forceps or cotton-&#173;tipped applicators. If any question remains as to whether the globe has been penetrated, consideration must be given to exploration in the operating room. In general, small linear conjunctival lacerations do not need to be sutured. However, stellate conjunctival lacerations, lacerations with bare sclera exposed, or lacerations with lost or retracted conjunctival tissue will heal faster if sutured closed.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Conjunctival Foreign Body</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Foreign bodies on the conjunctival surface are best recognized with slit-lamp examination. Foreign bodies can lodge in the cul-de-sac, or they may be located on the palpebral conjunctival surface of the upper eyelid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-23</span>). When a patient reports an ocular foreign-&#173;body sensation, topical fluorescein should be instilled to check for the fine, vertical, linear corneal abrasions characteristic of retained foreign bodies on the eyelid margin or superior tarsal plate (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-24</span>). Foreign matter embedded in tissue can be removed with a sterile, disposable hypodermic needle. Glass particles, cactus spines, and insect hairs are often difficult to see, but a careful search of the cul-de-sac with high magnification aids in identification and removal. These foreign bodies may be removed with fine-tipped jeweler’s forceps or a blunt spatula. If a foreign body is suspected but not seen, the cul-de-sac should be irrigated and wiped with a cotton-&#173;tipped applicator moistened with topical anesthetic. Double eversion of the eyelid with a Desmarres retractor or a bent paper clip may be necessary to allow the examiner to effectively search the entire arc of the superior cul-de-sac (see Fig&#160;14-9).</p>
			<p class="body-text">If no foreign body is found after a thorough examination, the next step is copious irrigation to cleanse the fornix. This procedure should then be repeated for both the upper and lower eyelids. Gunpowder or carbon fragments, such as those that may be embedded in the conjunctiva by a blast injury, should be removed if possible, but can be well tolerated in the substantia propria.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Corneal Abrasion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Disruption of the corneal epithelium is usually associated with immediate pain, foreign-&#173;body sensation, tearing, and discomfort with blinking. A slit-lamp examination is essential in determining the presence, extent, and depth of the corneal defect. Fluorescein staining of the cornea is very helpful in diagnosing a foreign body. It is important to distinguish between a corneal abrasion, which generally has sharply defined edges and little to no associated inflammation (when seen acutely), and a corneal ulcer, which is characterized by opacification and an inflammation-&#173;mediated breakdown of the stromal matrix and possible thinning. Also, it is important to rule out a foreign body as the cause of the abrasion. Occasionally, a patient may not recall a definite history of trauma but still present with signs and symptoms suggestive of a corneal abrasion. An eye with a corneal abrasion from a fingernail, piece of paper, or tree branch is more likely to develop recurrent erosions, the symptoms of which are the same as those of a corneal abrasion and typically occur upon awakening (see Chapter&#160;4 for a discussion of recurrent corneal erosions). Herpes simplex virus keratitis should also be excluded as a possible diagnosis in such cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pressure patching can relieve pain from an abrasion by immobilizing the upper eyelid to prevent rubbing against the corneal defect, although patching is not necessary for most abrasions and some patients may find patches uncomfortable. Topical antibiotic ointment is suggested in either case. Another alternative is a bandage contact lens, which provides pain relief and facilitates reepithelialization. Antibiotic drops rather than ointment should be used with a bandage lens. Topical antibiotic drops are recommended until the epithelium heals. Cycloplegics can help with the ciliary spasm associated with a corneal abrasion. Topical nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory agents have anesthetic properties and may be used for the first 24–48&#160;hours for pain relief in selected patients; however, these agents should be used with caution, as they can cause local toxicity and delay wound healing. Oral pain management for the first 24–48&#160;hours can be helpful for many patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with abrasions caused by organic material require close follow-&#173;up to monitor for fungal infection. Abrasions caused by vegetable matter such as a fingernail, paper, leaves, or thorns heal more slowly than abrasions caused by inorganic materials such as steel, glass, or plastic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with contact lens–associated epithelial defects due to excessive wear or an improper fit should not receive a patch or have a therapeutic contact lens applied because of the risk of promoting or worsening a corneal infection. These patients should be treated with topical antibiotic drops or ointment.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Corneal Foreign Body</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Small foreign bodies can become embedded in the corneal epithelial surface, as the texture of the cornea is similar to gelatin. Larger foreign bodies can cause a corneal abrasion and then leave the eye. Because of the density of corneal pain fibers in the normal eye, an abrasion and a foreign body feel the same to the patient. Blinking abrades the epithelial defect and exacerbates discomfort. Treatment should mitigate the effect of the upper eyelid on the epithelial defect to minimize discomfort and promote healing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal foreign bodies are identified most effectively by slit-lamp examination. Before removing a corneal foreign body, the clinician should assess the depth of corneal penetration. Occult intraocular foreign bodies must be ruled out when there is a history of exposure to high-speed metallic foreign bodies, typically from grinding tools and metal-on-&#173;metal hammering.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Identifying the composition of a corneal foreign body by either history or examination is important. Vegetable matter, such as leaves, thorns, bark, and dirt, presents an increased risk of fungal keratitis, so corticosteroid drops are contraindicated in patients with these types of foreign bodies, because of the risk of potentiating fungal infection. Contaminated foreign material from a hospital or medical setting may pose a higher risk of bacterial infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If glass foreign bodies are present, all exposed fragments should be removed. Fragments deeply embedded in the cornea are often inert and can be left in place (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-25</span>). Careful gonioscopic evaluation of the anterior chamber is essential to ensure that the iris and the angle are free of any retained glass particles. Glass particles in the anterior chamber are indicative of a perforating ocular injury.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When an iron foreign body has been embedded in the cornea for more than a few hours, an orange-brown “rust ring” results (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-26</span>). Corneal iron foreign bodies and rust rings can usually be removed at the slit lamp with a disposable (25-gauge or 26-gauge) hypodermic needle, after application of a topical anesthetic. A battery-&#173;powered dental burr with a sterile tip may also be utilized; however, the rotating burr can cause excessive tissue disruption and increased scar formation. A foreign body that enters the corneal stroma deep to the Bowman layer always results in some degree of scar formation. When these scars occur in the visual axis, they may result in glare and decreased vision from irregular astigmatism. Optimal management of a corneal foreign body therefore includes minimal disruption of the Bowman layer to avoid further scarring and obstruction of the visual axis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Therapy following the removal of a corneal foreign body includes the use of topical antibiotics, cycloplegia, and occasionally the application of a firm pressure patch or bandage contact lens to help the healing process. If a pressure patch or bandage contact lens is used, the risk of infection due to the foreign body is increased and the patient should be closely monitored until this risk has passed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Blast injuries may cause both penetrating and perforating corneal foreign bodies (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-27</span>). For patients with blast injuries, the clinician should meticulously remove all possible foreign bodies on or near the surface of the cornea to prevent subsequent erosion of the superficial foreign bodies and accompanying discomfort.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Evaluation</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">History</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If a patient presents with both ocular and systemic trauma, diagnosis and treatment of any life-&#173;threatening injury take precedence over evaluation and management of the ophthalmic injury. Once the patient is medically stable, the ophthalmologist should elicit a complete preoperative history. The diagnosis of a traumatic ocular injury may be obvious from casual examination of the eye. However, a thorough history of the nature of the injury should always be obtained and should include questions about the history and details of the injury, such as whether the injury was associated with</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">metal-on-metal strike</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">high-velocity projectile</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">high-energy impact on globe</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">sharp injuring object</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">lack of eye protection</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Evaluation of a patient with a traumatic ocular injury should include a complete general and ophthalmic examination. As soon as possible, the examiner should determine and record visual acuity, which is the most reliable predictor of final visual outcome in traumatized eyes. Pupillary examination should be performed to detect the presence of an afferent pupillary defect (including a reverse Marcus Gunn response) arising from the possibility of traumatic mydriasis. The examiner should then look for key signs that are suggestive or diagnostic of a penetrating or perforating ocular injury (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;14-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">If a significant perforating injury is suspected, forced duction testing, gonioscopy, tonometry, and scleral depression should be avoided. Ancillary tests that may be useful in this setting are summarized in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;14-6</span>. All cases should be managed with safeguards appropriate for patients known to have blood-borne infections.</p>
			<p class="h2">Nonsurgical Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some perforating injuries are so minimal that they seal spontaneously before ophthalmic examination, with no intraocular damage, prolapse, or adherence. These cases may require only systemic and/or topical antibiotic therapy along with close observation. Small, nongaping wounds may be treated as corneal abrasions with patching or a bandage contact lens until the epithelial defect has resolved and the patient is comfortable.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If a corneal wound is leaking (ie, the Seidel test result is positive; see Chapter&#160;2, Fig&#160;2-22) but the anterior chamber remains formed, the clinician can attempt to stop the leak with the following interventions, used in combination or alone: pharmacologic suppression of aqueous production (topical [eg, <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker] or systemic), patching, a therapeutic contact lens, or a tissue adhesive. Generally, if these measures fail to seal the wound within 2&#160;days, surgical closure with sutures is recommended. If the corneal wound is leaking in the presence of a very shallow or flat anterior chamber, urgent surgical repair is required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When a foreign body is present, the management of a corneal perforation poses a special challenge. The Descemet membrane is the strongest structural barrier to perforation of the cornea; foreign bodies may penetrate through the stroma and lodge anterior to the Descemet membrane. It may be difficult to determine whether removal of a deep foreign body will dislodge a self-sealed wound, so judicious decision making is mandatory. If multiple, very small foreign bodies are seen in the deep stroma (as may occur after an explosion) with no resultant inflammation or sign of infection, the patient may be monitored closely, given that aggressive surgical manipulation of the cornea in search of the very last particle may be unnecessary. If anterior chamber extension is present or suspected, the foreign body should be removed in a sterile environment such as an operating room. Overly aggressive attempts to remove deeply embedded foreign bodies at the slit lamp may result in leakage of aqueous humor and collapse of the anterior chamber.</p>
			<p class="h2">Surgical Management</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Preoperative management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If surgical repair is required, the timing of the operation is crucial. Although studies have not documented any disadvantage in delaying the repair of an open globe for up to 36&#160;hours, intervention ideally should occur as soon as possible. Prompt closure of the wound to restore the integrity of the globe helps minimize the risk of additional damage to intraocular contents, inflammation, microbial proliferation, and endophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following should be done before proceeding to the operating room:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-12">apply a protective shield</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">avoid interventions that require prying open the eyelids</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ensure that the patient has no food or liquids</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">prescribe appropriate medications for sedation and pain control</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">initiate intravenous antibiotics and antiemetics</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">provide tetanus prophylaxis</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-13">seek anesthesia consultation</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Injuries associated with soil contamination and/or retained intraocular foreign bodies increase the risk of <span class="italic">Bacillus</span> endophthalmitis. Because this organism can destroy the eye within 24&#160;hours, intravenous and/or intravitreal therapy with an antibiotic effective against <span class="italic">Bacillus</span> species may be necessary; fluoroquinolones (eg, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin), clindamycin, or vancomycin should be considered. Surgical repair should be undertaken with minimal delay in cases at risk for contamination with this organism.</p>
			<p class="h3">Anesthesia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">General anesthesia is almost always preferred for repair of an open globe because retrobulbar or peribulbar anesthetic injection increases posterior orbital pressure, which may cause or exacerbate the extrusion of intraocular contents. Local or topical anesthesia may be considered for the repair in rare instances, such as a patient with a small, self-&#173;sealing laceration who is at medical risk from general anesthesia. After the surgical repair is complete, a periocular anesthetic injection may be used to control postoperative pain.</p>
			<p class="h3">Surgical repair considerations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Management of a typical full-&#173;thickness corneoscleral laceration with uveal prolapse generally requires surgical repair in the operating room (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-28</span>). The primary goal of the repair is to restore the integrity of the globe. The secondary goal at the time of the primary repair or during subsequent procedures is to restore vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Primary enucleation should be performed only for an injury so devastating that restoration of the anatomy is impossible, when it may spare the patient another procedure. If the prognosis for vision in the injured eye is hopeless and the patient is at risk for sympathetic ophthalmia, enucleation must be considered. In the overwhelming majority of cases, however, the advantages of delaying enucleation for a few days far outweigh any advantage of primary enucleation. This delay (which should not exceed the 12–14&#160;days thought necessary for an injured eye to incite sympathetic ophthalmia) allows for assessment of postoperative visual function, consultation with a vitreoretinal or ophthalmic plastic surgeon, and stabilization of the patient’s medical condition. Most importantly, delay in enucleation following attempted repair and subsequent loss of light perception allow the patient time to acknowledge both loss of vision and accompanying disfigurement and to thoughtfully consider the benefits of enucleation in a nonemergency setting.</p>

			<p class="h3">Repair of a corneoscleral laceration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Repair of a corneoscleral laceration in the operating room should take precedence over non-life-&#173;threatening surgical problems elsewhere on the body. Repair of an adnexal injury should follow repair of the globe itself because eyelid surgery can put pressure on an open globe, and certain eyelid lacerations may actually improve globe exposure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The corneal component of the injury is approached first. If vitreous or lens fragments have prolapsed through the wound, the surgeon should cut these fragments flush with the surface of the globe (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-29</span>), taking care not to exert traction on the vitreous or zonular fibers. If uvea or retina (seen as translucent, tan tissue with extremely fine vessels) protrudes, the surgeon should reposit it using a gentle sweeping technique through a separate limbal incision, with the assistance of viscoelastic injection to keep the anterior chamber formed. If epithelium has obviously migrated onto a uveal surface or into the wound, an effort should be made to peel the epithelial layer off. Only in cases of frankly necrotic macerated tissue should uveal tissue be excised.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Points at which the laceration crosses landmarks such as the limbus are then closed with 9-0 or 10-0 nylon suture, followed by closure of the remaining corneal components of the laceration. It may be necessary to reposit iris tissue repeatedly after each suture is placed to avoid entrapment of iris in the wound. Despite these efforts, uvea may remain apposed to the posterior corneal surface. Very shallow sutures may be helpful at this stage of closure to avoid impaling the uvea with the suture needle. Then, after the closure is watertight, the uvea can be definitively separated from the cornea with viscoelastic injection, followed by replacement of the shallow sutures with deeper ones of near-full-&#173;thickness depth. Suture knots should be buried in the corneal stroma with the knot on the side of firmest tissue support to facilitate eventual removal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If watertight closure of the wound proves difficult to achieve because of unusual laceration configuration or loss of tissue, X-shaped or purse-string sutures or other customized techniques may suffice. Cyanoacrylate glue or even primary lamellar keratoplasty may be required in extremely difficult cases, but a bandage contact lens over the glue is necessary for comfort. A conjunctival flap should not be used to treat a wound leak.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When the anatomy of the wound allows, specific suturing techniques may be helpful to restore the normal corneal contour. Longer, more widely spaced sutures create flattening in the area of the suture and are therefore placed in the peripheral cornea to re-create the aspheric curvature of the cornea—flatter in the periphery and steeper centrally. Shorter, more closely spaced sutures are then used centrally, when possible, in order to close the wound without excessive central flattening (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-30</span>). When the sutures are being tied, it is important to have sufficient tension to create a watertight closure but not excessive tightness, which can induce corneal folds, astigmatism, or maceration of the inflamed stromal tissue. The knots should be buried for patient comfort. Very short sutures are harder to remove than longer sutures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To evaluate the scleral component of the laceration, a gentle peritomy and conjunctival separation are performed to expose the wound. Prolapsed vitreous is excised, and prolapsed nonnecrotic uvea and retina are reposited, as in corneal repair, by use of a spatula or similar instrument (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-31</span>). The scleral wound is closed with 9-0 nylon or 8-0 silk sutures. Often, resection of Tenon capsule and management of prolapsed tissue must be repeated incrementally after each suture is placed. The McCannel technique is a popular approach for repair of an iris defect (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-32</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some posterior wounds may require visualization with a loupe and a headlight if the open globe cannot be rotated enough for visualization under the operating microscope. If the laceration extends under an extraocular muscle, the muscle may be carefully removed at its insertion and then reinserted following repair. The surgeon should exercise extreme care if fixation of an open globe with rectus muscle sutures is necessary for visualization, as is sometimes done in retinal surgery, because doing so would put undue pressure on the eye and could exacerbate the extrusion of intraocular structures. Closure of the laceration should continue posteriorly only to the point at which it becomes technically difficult or requires undue pressure on the globe to complete. Very posterior lacerations may be tamponaded effectively by orbital tissue and are best left alone.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once the globe is watertight, the surgeon must decide whether intraocular surgery (if necessary) should be attempted immediately or postponed. Deciding whether to pursue such intervention at the time of initial repair is a complex process. The expertise of the surgeon; the quality of the facility, technical equipment, and instruments; the adequacy of the view of anterior segment structures; and issues of informed consent should be considered. In general, it is recommended that, if there are concerns regarding any of these parameters, the surgeon complete the closure of the laceration to maintain globe integrity and postpone the secondary procedures until a later date. For example, the average anterior segment surgeon should not attempt automated vitrectomy with retina present in the anterior chamber, and the most expert cataract surgeon might not attempt a lens extraction with limited visualization.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As always, the welfare of the patient determines the proper course. In general, if a foreign body is visible in the anterior segment and can be grasped, it is reasonable to remove it, either through the wound or through a separate limbal incision. Metal fragments are difficult to remove through their entrance wounds because the rough metal edges usually require a surprisingly larger wound for extraction than would appear necessary. If removal of opacified lens material is attempted, it is helpful to know whether the posterior capsule has been violated and lens–vitreous admixture has occurred. The removal of a ruptured lens may be undertaken from a posterior approach with vitrectomy during a second procedure. BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract,</span> also discusses the issues of cataract surgery and IOL placement following trauma to the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Closure of iris lacerations helps keep the iris in its proper plane, decreasing the formation of anterior or posterior synechiae while reducing glare and polyopia from severe corectopia, but may be difficult to achieve during the primary procedure. Iridodialysis may cause monocular diplopia and an eccentric pupil if left untreated. In the event that corneal opacity prevents safe repair of internal ocular injury, repairs can be performed secondarily.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Subconjunctival injections of antibiotics to cover both gram-&#173;positive and gram-&#173;negative organisms may be given prophylactically at the conclusion of the repair. Intravitreal antibiotics such as vancomycin 1&#160;mg and ceftazidime 2.25&#160;mg should be considered for contaminated wounds involving the vitreous.</p>
			<p class="h3">Postoperative management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Postoperatively, therapy is directed at preventing infection, suppressing inflammation, controlling IOP, and relieving pain. Patients may be given intravenous antibiotics (eg, a cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside) for 48&#160;hours or an oral antibiotic such as moxifloxacin (400&#160;mg per day) for 3–5&#160;days. Topical antibiotics are generally instilled 4&#160;times a day for 7&#160;days or until epithelial closure of the ocular surface is complete. Topical corticosteroids may be given 4–8&#160;times a day, depending on the amount of inflammation or the risk of infection. Corticosteroid drops and cycloplegics are slowly tapered as the inflammation subsides. A fibrinous response in the anterior chamber may respond well to a short course of systemic prednisone. IOP should be monitored; low pressure may suggest a wound leak, cyclodialysis, ciliary body shutdown, choroidal effusion, or intraocular hemorrhage. Elevated IOP should be controlled to minimize the risk of optic nerve damage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal sutures that do not loosen spontaneously are generally left in place for at least 3&#160;months, depending on wound healing and patient age, and then removed incrementally over the next few months. Fibrosis and vascularization are indicators that enough healing has occurred to render suture removal safe. Applying fluorescein at each postoperative visit is mandatory to ensure that suture loosening or erosion through the epithelium has not occurred, as these eroded sutures can induce pain, infection, and inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Traumatized eyes are at increased risk of choroidal effusion or retinal detachment, so frequent examination of the posterior segment is mandatory. If media opacity precludes an adequate fundus examination, evaluation for an afferent pupillary defect and B-scan ultrasonography are useful in monitoring retinal status.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Refraction and vision correction with contact lenses or glasses can proceed when the ocular surface and media permit. Partial or complete suture removal should be performed when safe to facilitate improvement in vision. Because of the risk of amblyopia in a child or loss of fusion in an adult, vision correction should not be unnecessarily delayed.</p>

Blunt force applied to the eye displaces the aqueous volume peripherally, causing an increase in hydraulic pressure at the lens, iris root, and trabecular meshwork. If this “wedge of pressure” exceeds the tensile strength of ocular structures, the vessels in the peripheral iris and the anterior ciliary body may rupture, leading to hyphema. The force may cause scleral ruptures, typically at the limbus and posterior to the muscle insertions, where the sclera is thinner and unsupported by the orbital bones. Severe trauma leads to lens subluxation, retinal dialysis, optic nerve avulsion, and/or vitreous hemorrhage. <span class="figure-source-note">(Illustration by Cyndie&#160;C.H. Wooley.)</span></p>
