			<p class="part-intro--title-">Introduction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ancient Greeks and Romans believed that the lens was the part of the eye responsible for the faculty of seeing. They theorized that the optic nerves were hollow channels through which “visual spirits” traveled from the brain to meet visual rays from the outside world at the lens, which they thought was located in the center of the globe. The visual information would then flow back to the brain. This concept was known as the <span class="italic">emanation theory of vision.</span> Celsus (25&#160;<span class="small-cap">bc</span>–<span class="small-cap">ad</span>&#160;50) drew the lens in the center of the globe, with an empty space called the <span class="italic">locus vacuus</span> anterior to it, in <span class="small-cap">ad</span>&#160;30 (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;I-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">These erroneous ideas about lens position and function persisted through the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, as shown by the drawing of the Belgian anatomist Andreas Vesalius in 1543 (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;I-2</span>). The true position of the crystalline lens was illustrated by the Italian anatomist Fabricius ab Aquapendente in 1600 (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;I-3</span>), and the Swiss physician Felix Plater (1536–1614) was the first to postulate that the retina, not the lens, was the part of the eye responsible for sight.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Today, many areas of lens physiology and biochemistry are still subjects of active research. No medical treatment, for example, can yet prevent the formation or progression of cataract in the lens of the otherwise healthy adult eye, and theories about cataract formation and innovative forms of management continue to be controversial. Although various risk factors for cataract development have been identified (discussed in Chapter&#160;1), data to develop guidelines for reducing the risk of cataract remain inconclusive.</p>
			<p class="body-text _idGenParaOverride-1">The prevalence of lens disorders and continuing developments in their management make the basic and clinical science of this structure a vital component of ophthalmology training. The goal of Section&#160;11 is to provide a curriculum for the study of the structure and function of the normal lens, the features of diseases involving the lens, and the surgical management of cataract.</p>

			<p class="chapter-title">Epidemiology of Cataract</p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Introduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataract is the leading cause of vision loss in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 18&#160;million people are bilaterally blind due to cataract and that the condition causes 48% of cases of blindness worldwide. Cataract is also a leading cause of visual impairment, with 33% of the world’s population experiencing decreased vision because of this disorder; only refractive error has a greater impact in this regard. It is important to note that most cases of blindness due to cataract (up to 90%) are found in developing nations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">While the adverse impact of cataract on vision worldwide is undeniable, the lack of a widely accepted, standardized classification for lens opacities makes it difficult to precisely determine the incidence and prevalence of this condition. As discussed in Chapters&#160;4 and&#160;5, cataracts may be congenital, metabolic, age related, or traumatic in origin. Because of their high prevalence, age-&#173;related cataracts are presumed to have the greatest socioeconomic impact. However, most estimates of the frequency of age-&#173;related cataract are based on data from select groups rather than from the general population. Finally, in many older patients, coexisting pathology may cause vision loss that is incorrectly attributed to lens change.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Vision Health Initiative estimates that cataracts affect more than 24&#160;million individuals in the United States and that this number will rise to 30.1&#160;million by 2020. </p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Rate of Cataract Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 3&#160;million cataract surgeries are performed annually in the United States, making this procedure the most common surgery performed on an outpatient basis. The direct medical cost related to the treatment of cataract in the United States, including surgery, office visits, and prescriptions, is approximately $6.8&#160;billion annually.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The rate of cataract surgery in developed countries is up to 10,000 per million population per year. In China, the rate is 300–400 per million. In parts of the developing world, the number may be as low as 50&#160;surgeries per million.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In 1999, the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB) and the WHO collaborated to launch VISION 2020: The Right to Sight, an initiative to develop the infrastructure necessary for sustainable provision of high-&#173;quality cataract surgical services throughout the developing world. The WHO determined that the number of cataract surgeries performed worldwide would have to triple to keep pace with need, with a goal of 3000&#160;surgeries per million population annually.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Distribution of Cataract Subtypes</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Beaver Dam Eye Study, a large population-&#173;based study performed in the late 1980s, reported that 38.8% of men and 45.9% of women older than 74&#160;years had visually significant cataracts. For this study “significance” was determined by photographic grading of lens opacities and a specified best-&#173;corrected visual acuity of 20/32 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] equivalent closest to the 20/30 Snellen fraction), excluding individuals with severe age-&#173;related maculopathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A follow-up to the Beaver Dam Eye Study was performed between 1993 and 1995 to estimate the incidence of nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSCs) in the study cohort. Incident nuclear cataract was present in 13.1% of the study cohort; cortical cataract, in 8.2%; and PSC, in 3.4%. The cumulative incidence of nuclear cataract increased from 2.9% in persons aged 43–54&#160;years at baseline to 40% in those aged 75&#160;years or older. For cortical cataract, the corresponding values were 1.9% and 21.8%, respectively; for PSC, 1.4% and 7.3%. Women were more likely than men to have nuclear cataracts, even after adjustments for age were made.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Salisbury Eye Evaluation project, which reported results in 1998, was a prospective, population-&#173;based cohort study designed to identify racial differences in the prevalence of cataracts in a group of Americans older than 65&#160;years. Nuclear cataract was noted in 50.7% of Caucasians versus 33.5% of African Americans. Conversely, cortical cataract was far more likely to be identified in African Americans than in Caucasians. PSC was found at roughly the same rate, between 5% and 10%, in both groups.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Barbados Eye Study provided prevalence data on lens opacities in a predominantly black population. Cortical opacities were the most frequent type of cataract, and women had a higher frequency of opacification than did men.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Studies of Asian populations, including the Singapore Malay Eye Study and the Handan Eye Study, have been performed to evaluate the incidence of different cataract subtypes. These studies suggest a higher rate of cortical cataract in Asians than in Caucasians.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Risk Factors for the Development of Cataract</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Smoking is an established risk factor for development of nuclear sclerotic cataract and PSC. The Beaver Dam Eye Study and the Blue Mountains Eye Study, among others, concluded that there is a higher and dose-&#173;related risk of visually significant nuclear sclerosis for study participants who smoke. Some smoking-&#173;related damage to the lens may be reversible upon cessation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Additional risk factors for cataract identified by multiple studies include UV-light exposure, diabetes mellitus, prolonged corticosteroid use (systemic, inhaled, and topical), ocular trauma (including prior ocular surgery), and high myopia. Also implicated in the development of cataract are exogenous estrogen use, alcohol consumption, and increased body mass index; however, study results regarding the impact of these factors are inconsistent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The role of nutrition in preventing cataracts (specifically, the potential benefit of supplementation with antioxidants) has been a subject of recent interest. Some studies have shown a benefit to increased intake of vitamins&#160;C and&#160;E. However, in the Age-&#173;Related Eye Disease Study&#160;1 (AREDS1), a formulation of vitamin&#160;C, vitamin&#160;E, beta carotene, zinc, and copper did not reduce the risk of progression to cataract surgery. In a large Italian trial, use of a multivitamin and mineral supplement benefited individuals with nuclear sclerotic cataract but increased the risk of PSC. Age-&#173;Related Eye Disease Study&#160;2 (AREDS2), results of which were published in 2013, evaluated the effects of lutein/zeaxanthin supplementation. This study concluded that these supplements had no significant overall effect on rates of progression to cataract surgery, although patients in the lowest quintile of dietary lutein/zeaxanthin intake did have a reduced risk of cataract development following supplementation.</p>
