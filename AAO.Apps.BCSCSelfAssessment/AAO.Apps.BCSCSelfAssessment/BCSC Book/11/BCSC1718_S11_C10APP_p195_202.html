			<p class="h1">Key Developments in Cataract Extraction</p>
			 <div id="Chapt10_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">By 1600, anatomists had correctly identified the position of the crystalline lens (see the Introduction, Fig&#160;I-3), and the current definition of cataract, opacification of the lens, had been established. The initial method of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), developed by Daviel (1696–1762), represented a substantial improvement over the much older couching technique. In ECCE, the lens is removed through an opening in the anterior capsule, and the capsular bag is left in place. Because of the large incision size used in ECCE, early ECCE was complicated by problems with wound healing, vitreous and uveal prolapse, and infection. In addition, lens remnant–induced inflammation and capsular opacification were common, and secondary discission of pupillary membranes was often necessary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE), the removal of the lens with its capsule intact, was first performed in 1753 by Sharp (1709–1778). Various instruments were developed to grasp and extract the lens, including toothless forceps and suction cup–like devices called erysiphakes. Twentieth-&#173;century advances in ICCE included chemical dissolution of zonular fibers with <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-chymotrypsin, reported by Barraquer in 1957, and use of the cryoprobe, introduced by Kelman in 1962. ICCE remained the most widely used method for cataract surgery in the United States until the late 1970s, when ECCE, and later phacoemulsification, predominated. The development of the binocular operating microscope, irrigation/aspiration (I/A) systems, ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs), and intraocular lenses (IOLs) reduced the complications associated with earlier versions of ECCE and helped it become a predominant procedure once again.</p>

			<p class="h1">Extracapsular Cataract Extraction</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Patient Preparation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After informed consent is obtained, the operative site is marked, and the pupil is maximally dilated. A “time-out” is performed to ensure that the surgical team is prepared for the correct surgical procedure on the correct patient, with the correct implant (see Chapter&#160;7).</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the anesthesia has been administered and the eye is prepared and draped in sterile fashion, an eyelid speculum is placed.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Incision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A fornix-&#173;based conjunctival flap is made superiorly, followed by cauterization of the scleral bed. The initial incision usually consists of a limbal groove, fashioned with a round-&#173;tipped steel blade, sharp microknife, or diamond knife. Some surgeons prefer a slightly more posterior incision with anterior dissection, creating a scleral flap or tunnel. Nucleus expression requires a limbal chord length of 8–12&#160;mm, smaller than the incision required for ICCE. A stab incision is made under the flap into the anterior chamber in preparation for anterior capsulotomy, and the cystotome is inserted to begin the procedure. The anterior chamber depth can be stabilized with OVDs, air bubble, or continuous fluid irrigation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Anterior Capsulotomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An anterior capsulotomy allows the surgeon to remove the cataract with the capsular bag intact and to ultimately stabilize the IOL, once implanted, within the capsular bag. The surgeon initiates a continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC) by making a puncture or small tear in the anterior capsule using a cystotome needle or capsulorrhexis forceps with special tips for grasping and tearing. The edge of this tear is then grasped with the cystotome tip or with forceps and pulled around smoothly, removing a circular portion of the anterior capsule (see Chapter&#160;7). The CCC used for ECCE needs to be larger (&gt;6&#160;mm) than the CCC created for routine phacoemulsification (approximately 5&#160;mm) to allow for safe expression of an intact nucleus. Expression of a large or dense nucleus may require relaxing incisions in the CCC in order to avoid uncontrolled traumatic tears in the capsulorrhexis, which can lead to rupture of the posterior capsule. Alternatively, a cystotome needle may be used to make a series of connected punctures or small tears in a circular pattern (<span class="italic">can-&#173;opener capsulotomy;</span> <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;A-1</span>). After the capsulotomy is completed, the initial limbal or scleral incision is widened to allow safe passage of the nucleus through the incision.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Nucleus Removal</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Manual expression of the nucleus involves pressing on the inferior limbus to tip the superior pole of the nucleus up and out of the capsular bag. Applying additional counterpressure on the globe by using an instrument to indent the sclera posterior to the limbus, 180° away from the incision, expresses the nucleus from the anterior chamber. The surgeon removes the nucleus by loosening and elevating it from the capsule with the use of a hook or irrigating cannula and then supporting it on a lens loop, spoon, or vectis that will subsequently be used to slide or irrigate the nucleus out of the chamber.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The incision is partially sutured to allow deepening of the anterior chamber with irrigation. Using the I/A equipment, the surgeon then aspirates the lens cortex under direct visualization in the pupillary space.</p>
			<p class="h2">IOL Insertion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prior to IOL insertion, the anterior chamber is usually filled with an OVD. A posterior chamber IOL may be inserted into the ciliary sulcus or into the capsular bag. Sulcus fixation typically requires an IOL with a larger overall diameter (at least 13&#160;mm) and a large-&#173;diameter optic (at least 6&#160;mm), which is more forgiving in case of postoperative decentration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To insert the IOL into the capsular bag, an OVD is injected into the bag, with care taken to separate the anterior capsule flap completely from the posterior capsule. Direct visualization of haptic placement in the capsular bag during IOL insertion is critical.</p>
			<p class="h2">Closure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ECCE incision is typically closed with multiple interrupted sutures of 10-0 nylon or 1&#160;running suture. Proper suture tension helps reduce postoperative astigmatism: loose sutures induce corneal flattening, whereas tight sutures cause corneal steepening in the axis of the suture.</p>
			<p class="h2">Postoperative Course</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Visual acuity on the first postoperative day should be consistent with the refractive state of the eye, the clarity of the ocular media, and the visual potential of the retina and optic nerve. Mild eyelid edema and erythema may be present. The cornea may also be mildly edematous. The anterior chamber should have normal depth, and a mild to moderate cellular reaction is typical. The posterior capsule should be clear, and the implant should be well positioned and stable. The red reflex should be bright and clear. Elevation in <br />intraocular pressure (IOP) may be associated with retained OVD. Topical antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroid eyedrops are generally prescribed postoperatively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The postoperative course should be characterized by steady improvement in vision and comfort as the inflammatory reaction subsides. The refraction is typically stable by the fourth to sixth postoperative week, and spectacles may then be prescribed. If a significant amount of postoperative astigmatism is present in the axis of tight sutures, the clinician may selectively remove the sutures, as guided by wound stability, keratometry readings, or corneal topography measurements.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Manual Small-Incision Cataract Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Manual small-incision cataract surgery (MSICS) is a variation of ECCE first described by Blumenthal in 1994. MSICS utilizes surgical instruments similar to those employed in ECCE, as well as a binocular operating microscope, but it does not require access to other high-&#173;technology instrumentation, making it particularly useful in areas of the world in need of high-&#173;volume, low-cost cataract extraction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The primary differences between ECCE and MSICS are that, in the latter, a smaller incision and mechanical fragmentation of the nucleus for delivery are used. The scleral incision is made 1.5–2.0&#160;mm posterior to the limbus in the form of a straight or frown-&#173;shaped groove 6–7&#160;mm in length. Using a crescent blade, the surgeon tunnels this incision forward 1.5&#160;mm, into clear cornea. The tunnel is shaped like a trapezoid, such that the internal incision is wider than the external scleral incision. This construction allows for delivery of the nucleus, which can be divided into smaller segments prior to removal, while maintaining a self-&#173;sealing external incision. A small, or soft, nucleus may be expressed intact with a Simcoe cannula (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;A-2</span>), vectis, or lens loop. A large or dense nucleus may require bimanual fragmentation prior to delivery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aspiration of cortex is performed using the Simcoe cannula. A rigid 6-mm polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) lens is then placed into the capsular bag. A properly constructed wound should be self-&#173;sealing. If necessary, the wound may be closed with 10-0 nylon sutures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Studies have shown that, in comparison to ECCE, MSICS allows a higher surgical volume and faster visual recovery and it results in less postoperative astigmatism and better uncorrected visual acuity (also called uncorrected distance visual acuity). Visual outcomes and complication rates for MSICS are similar to those for phacoemulsification performed in the developing world.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Intracapsular Cataract Extraction</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Patient Preparation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The preparation for planned ICCE is similar to that for ECCE. If retro-&#173;orbital anesthesia is used, preoperative orbital massage by digital pressure or compressive devices may be employed to decrease the pressure effect from the increased orbital volume produced by this anesthetic. Some surgeons use mannitol to decrease the orbital and vitreous volume. Mannitol should be used with caution in elderly patients and those with congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or renal compromise.</p>
			<p class="h2">Exposure of the Globe</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After the skin and ocular surface have been prepared and the eye is draped, an eyelid speculum is placed. A bridle suture is usually required to hold the eye in a slight downward position. The surgeon can accomplish this step by placing a 6-0&#160;silk suture beneath the superior rectus tendon or within sclera and securing the suture to the superior drape.</p>
			<p class="h2">Incision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The surgeon creates either a fornix-&#173;based or a limbus-&#173;based conjunctival flap, and then uses cautery to achieve hemostasis. A scleral support ring may be necessary in young patients or in those with high myopia to avoid scleral collapse when the lens is extracted. In patients with deep-set eyes, the ring may be needed to improve exposure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Incision placement varies according to surgeon preference and the patient’s anatomy. More-&#173;anterior or corneal incisions may be of shorter chord length and result in less bleeding. However, closure of such incisions induces corneal steepening in the meridian of the incision. Incisions that are more posterior heal faster and, when covered by a conjunctival flap, are more comfortable to the patient. Posterior incisions induce less astigmatism and are less damaging to the corneal endothelium, but they cause more bleeding.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sutures are preplaced across the incision and looped out of the way; their presence allows rapid closure of the eye in case of choroidal hemorrhage, Valsalva maneuver, or other causes of positive posterior pressure. An additional suture may be placed through the anterior lip of the incision only; this will allow the surgical assistant to elevate the cornea at the time of lens delivery, facilitating delivery.</p>
			<p class="h2">Iridectomy and Lens Delivery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An iridectomy is performed at this point. If the eye has a small pupil, the surgeon may consider performing sector iridectomy, radial iridotomy, or multiple sphincterotomies or using iris hooks or pupil expanders.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-Chymotrypsin, if available, can be injected via a cannula through the pupillary space into the posterior chamber. An iris retractor can be used to expose the superior surface of the lens. A cellulose sponge is employed to dry the anterior lens capsule. Next, the surgeon positions the cryoprobe, a hollow metal-&#173;tipped probe that is cooled by compressed nitrous oxide, on the lens surface. Once an ice ball has formed and the lens has adhered to the probe (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;A-3</span>), gentle to-and-fro maneuvers are used to deliver the lens. An iris retractor or cellulose sponge can be used to strip the vitreous from the posterior surface of the lens during delivery. Vitreous loss, combined with the larger incision of intracapsular surgery, contributes to posterior scleral collapse. Thus, the surgeon should anticipate the need for management of vitreous loss. The anterior vitrectomy apparatus that is part of the phacoemulsification machine can be used for controlled removal of vitreous. In addition, cellulose sponges may be used to engage vitreous, which can then be cut with Vannas scissors; this process should be repeated until all externalized vitreous has been removed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Next, a lens implant may be inserted, or the patient may be left aphakic. An anterior chamber lens can be inserted after instillation of acetylcholine or carbachol. Other lens implant options include posterior chamber lenses with iris or scleral fixation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgeon then uses sutures to close the incision while an OVD or balanced salt solution is utilized to keep the anterior chamber formed. The conjunctival flap is secured. Subconjunctival or sub-&#173;Tenon injection of antibiotics or corticosteroids can be given at this point. A patch and shield should be applied.</p>
			<p class="h2">Postoperative Course</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The postoperative course is generally similar to that for ECCE. If the eye has been left aphakic, visual acuity can be estimated with a +10.00 to +12.00&#160;D lens, or a +4.00&#160;D lens can be used as a telescope. The surgeon should monitor the appearance of the cornea, the security of the wound, the depth of the anterior chamber, the degree of inflammatory reaction, and the IOP. Visualizing the posterior segment is important for evaluation of vitreous clarity and position and for detecting any retinal or optic nerve pathology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is not unusual to see mild eyelid edema and erythema. The upper eyelid may be moderately ptotic. The conjunctiva is often mildly hyperemic, and subconjunctival hemorrhage may be present. The cornea should be clear, but some superior corneal edema is often present from the bending of the cornea during lens extraction. This edema generally resolves during the first postoperative week. The anterior chamber should have normal depth with mild to moderate cellular reaction. The pupil should be round and the iridectomy, patent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The postoperative course should be characterized by steady improvement in vision and comfort. Topical antibiotics, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids are typically used during the first postoperative weeks. The refraction generally becomes stable 6–12&#160;weeks after intracapsular surgery, depending on the wound-&#173;closure technique employed. It usually takes longer to achieve a stable refraction after ICCE than after ECCE or other procedures, because of the larger incision required for ICCE.</p>
