			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Age-Related Lens Changes</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As the lens ages, it increases in mass and thickness and decreases in accommodative power. As new layers of cortical fibers form concentrically, the lens nucleus compresses and hardens (a process known as nuclear sclerosis). Chemical modification and proteolytic cleavage of crystallins (lens proteins) result in the formation of high-&#173;molecular-mass protein aggregates. These aggregates may become large enough to cause abrupt fluctuations in the local refractive index of the lens, thereby scattering light and reducing transparency. Chemical modification of lens nuclear proteins also increases opacity, such that the lens becomes increasingly yellow or brown with advancing age (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-1</span>). Other age-&#173;related changes include decreased concentrations of glutathione and potassium and increased concentrations of sodium and calcium in the lens cell cytoplasm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A frequent cause of visual impairment in older adults is <span class="italic">age-&#173;related cataract,</span> the pathogenesis of which is multifactorial and not completely understood. There are 3&#160;main types of age-&#173;related cataracts: nuclear, cortical, and posterior subcapsular. In many patients, components of more than 1&#160;type are present. (See also BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors.</span>)</p>
			<p class="h2">Nuclear Cataracts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some degree of nuclear sclerosis and yellowing is normal in patients older than 50&#160;years. In general, this condition interferes only minimally with visual function. In eyes with nuclear cataracts, the central opacity causes an increased amount of light scattering, which the ophthalmologist observes as a yellow-&#173;brown central lens nucleus. A nuclear cataract (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-2</span>) is best evaluated by using a slit-lamp biomicroscope with off-&#173;axis illumination through a dilated pupil.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nuclear cataracts tend to progress slowly. They are usually bilateral but may be asymmetric. Nuclear cataracts typically cause greater impairment of distance vision than of near vision. In the early stages of cataract development, the progressive hardening of the lens nucleus frequently causes an increase in the refractive index of the lens and thus a myopic shift in refraction <span class="italic">(lenticular myopia).</span> In hyperopic or emmetropic eyes, the myopic shift enables otherwise presbyopic individuals to read without spectacles, a condition referred to as “second sight.” A change in astigmatism and, in rare instances, a hyperopic shift can occur as the nucleus matures. Occasionally, the abrupt change in refractive index between the sclerotic nucleus (or other lens opacities) and the lens cortex can cause monocular diplopia. Progressive yellowing or browning of the lens causes patients to have poor color discrimination, especially at the blue end of the visible-&#173;light spectrum. In bilateral cases, patients are frequently unaware of their altered color discrimination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Visual dysfunction in low light often occurs with advancing nuclear cataract. In the most advanced cases, the lens nucleus becomes increasingly opaque and brown and is called a <span class="italic">brunescent nuclear cataract.</span> The term <span class="italic">oil droplet cataract</span> is sometimes used to describe a cataract in which nuclear sclerosis is most pronounced in the central nucleus. Such cataracts are best evaluated on retinoscopy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, the nucleus in a nuclear cataract is difficult to distinguish from the nucleus of a normal, aged lens. Investigations by electron microscopy have identified an increased number of lamellar membrane whorls in some nuclear cataracts. The degree to which protein aggregates or these membrane modifications contribute to the increased light scattering of nuclear cataracts is unclear.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Cortical Cataracts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In contrast to nuclear cataracts, cortical cataracts are associated with the local disruption of the structure of mature lens fiber cells. Once membrane integrity is compromised, essential metabolites are lost from the affected cells. This loss leads to extensive protein oxidation and precipitation. Like nuclear cataracts, cortical cataracts are usually bilateral but are often asymmetric. Their effect on visual function varies greatly, depending on the location of the opacity relative to the visual axis. A common symptom of cortical cataracts is glare from intense focal light sources, such as car headlights. Monocular diplopia may also result. Cortical cataracts vary greatly in their rate of progression, with some cortical opacities remaining unchanged for prolonged periods and others progressing rapidly.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The first signs of cortical cataract formation visible with the slit-lamp biomicroscope are vacuoles (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-3</span>) and water clefts in the anterior or posterior cortex. The cortical lamellae may be separated by fluid. Wedge-shaped opacities (often called <span class="italic">cortical spokes</span> or <span class="italic">cuneiform opacities</span>) form near the periphery of the lens, with the pointed end of the opacities oriented toward the center (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-4</span>). The cortical spokes appear as white opacities when viewed with the slit-lamp biomicroscope and as dark shadows when viewed by retroillumination. The wedge-shaped opacities may spread to adjacent fiber cells and along the length of affected fibers, causing the degree of opacity to increase and extend toward the visual axis. When the entire cortex from the capsule to the nucleus becomes white and opaque, the cataract is said to be <span class="italic">mature</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-5</span>). In mature opacities, the lens absorbs water, becoming swollen and enlarged (termed <span class="italic">intumescent</span> cortical cataract); such cataracts may lead to angle-&#173;closure glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When degenerated cortical material leaks through the lens capsule, leaving the capsule wrinkled and shrunken, the cataract is referred to as <span class="italic">hypermature</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-6</span>). When further liquefaction of the cortex allows free movement of the nucleus within the capsular bag, the cataract is described as <span class="italic">morgagnian</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-7</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, cortical cataracts are characterized by local swelling and disruption of the lens fiber cells. Globules of eosinophilic material (morgagnian globules) are observed in slitlike spaces between lens fibers.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Posterior Subcapsular Cataracts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSCs) are often younger than those presenting with nuclear or cortical cataracts. PSCs are located in the posterior cortical layer and are visually significant only when they become axial (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-8</span>). The first indication of PSC formation is a subtle iridescent sheen in the posterior cortical layers that is visible with the slit lamp. At later stages, granular opacities and a plaquelike opacity of the posterior subcapsular cortex appear.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The patient often reports symptoms of glare and poor vision under bright-light conditions because a central PSC obscures more of the pupillary aperture when miosis is induced by bright lights, accommodation, or miotics. Near vision tends to be reduced more than distance vision. Some patients experience monocular diplopia. Slit-lamp detection of PSCs can best be accomplished through a dilated pupil. Retroillumination is also helpful.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As stated earlier, PSCs are one of the main types of cataract related to aging. However, they can also occur as a result of trauma; systemic, topical, or intraocular corticosteroid use; inflammation; exposure to ionizing radiation; and prolonged alcohol abuse.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, PSCs are associated with posterior migration of the lens epithelial cells from the lens equator to the visual axis on the inner surface of the posterior capsule. During their migration to or after their arrival at the posterior axis, the cells undergo aberrant enlargement. These swollen cells are called <span class="italic">Wedl</span> (or <span class="italic">bladder</span>) cells.</p>

			<div id="Chapt5_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Corticosteroids</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As mentioned earlier, long-term use of corticosteroids may cause PSCs. The development of corticosteroid-&#173;induced PSCs is related to the dose and treatment duration. Cataract formation can occur following administration of corticosteroids orally, topically, or by inhalation. The use of high-dose intraocular steroids to treat retinal neovascularization and inflammation also results in the development of PSCs and ocular hypertension. The advent of slow-&#173;release steroid repositories, including subconjunctival and intravitreal implants, has not altered the adverse ocular effects (intraocular pressure elevation and PSC development) of these medications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically and clinically, PSC formation occurring subsequent to corticosteroid use cannot be distinguished from senescent PSC formation. Some steroid-&#173;induced PSCs in children may resolve with cessation of the drug.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Phenothiazines</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phenothiazines, a major group of psychotropic medications, can cause pigmented deposits in the anterior lens epithelium in an axial configuration (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-9</span>). The occurrence of these deposits appears to depend on both drug dose and treatment duration. In addition, they are more likely to occur with the use of some phenothiazines, notably chlorpromazine and thioridazine, than with others. The vision changes associated with phenothiazine use are generally insignificant.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Miotics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topical anticholinesterases, which have been used in the treatment of glaucoma, can cause cataract formation. This type of cataract is increasingly uncommon, however, as these medications are now rarely used. The incidence of cataracts has been reported to be as high as 20% in patients after 55&#160;months of pilocarpine use and 60% in patients after echothiophate iodide use.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Usually, this type of cataract first appears as small vacuoles within and posterior to the anterior lens capsule and epithelium. The cataract may progress to posterior cortical and nuclear lens changes. Cataract formation is more likely in patients receiving anticholinesterase therapy over a long period and in those receiving more frequent dosing.</p>
			<p class="h2">Amiodarone</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmia medication, has been reported to cause stellate pigment deposition in the anterior cortical axis. Only very rarely is this condition visually significant. Amiodarone is also deposited in the corneal epithelium (cornea verticillata) and can cause a rare optic neuropathy.</p>
			<p class="h2">Statins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Studies performed in dogs have shown that some 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, known as <span class="italic">statins,</span> are associated with cataract when taken in excessive doses. Conflicting human studies have indicated that statins are both a risk factor for development of nuclear sclerotic cataracts and protective against them. However, concomitant use of simvastatin and erythromycin, which increases circulating statin levels, may be associated with approximately a twofold-&#173;increased risk of cataract.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Tamoxifen</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataract development and tamoxifen use were once thought to be linked; this suggested association has not been substantiated. Crystalline maculopathy has been reported in patients receiving high-dose tamoxifen therapy.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Trauma</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Traumatic lens damage may be caused by mechanical injury and by physical forces such as radiation, chemicals, and electrical current.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Contusion</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Vossius ring</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blunt injury to the eye can sometimes cause a ring of pigment (known as a <span class="italic">Vossius ring</span>) from the pupillary ruff to be imprinted on the anterior surface of the lens. Although a Vossius ring is visually insignificant and gradually resolves with time, its presence indicates prior blunt trauma.</p>
			<p class="h3">Traumatic cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A blunt, nonperforating injury may cause lens opacification either as an acute event or as a late sequela. A contusion cataract may involve only a portion of the lens or the entire lens. Often, the initial manifestation of a contusion cataract is a stellate or rosette-&#173;shaped opacification <span class="italic">(rosette cataract),</span> usually axial in location, that involves the posterior lens capsule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-10</span>). In some cases, blunt trauma causes both dislocation and cataract formation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-11</span>). In rare cases, mild contusion cataracts can improve spontaneously.</p>
			<p class="h3">Dislocation and subluxation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">During a blunt injury to the eye, rapid expansion of the globe in an equatorial plane immediately follows compression. This rapid equatorial expansion can disrupt the zonular fibers, causing dislocation or subluxation of the lens. The lens may be dislocated in any direction, including posteriorly into the vitreous cavity or anteriorly into the anterior chamber.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Symptoms and signs of traumatic lens subluxation include fluctuation of vision, impaired accommodation, monocular diplopia, and high astigmatism. Often, iridodonesis or phacodonesis is present. Retroillumination of the lens at the slit lamp through a dilated pupil may reveal the zonular disruption. In some cases, blunt trauma causes both dislocation and cataract formation.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Perforating or Penetrating Injury</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A perforating or penetrating injury of the lens often causes opacification of the cortex at the site of the rupture, usually progressing rapidly to complete opacification (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-12</span>). Occasionally, a small perforating injury of the lens capsule heals, resulting in a stationary focal cortical cataract (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-13</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Intraocular Procedures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Virtually any intraocular procedure may be associated with cataract formation, either soon after surgery or following a longer period of healing. Trans pars plana vitrectomy, especially with gas tamponade of the retina, is strongly associated with nuclear sclerotic cataract formation. A visually significant nuclear sclerotic cataract develops in up to 90% of phakic eyes within 2&#160;years of undergoing vitrectomy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Postvitrectomy cataracts are less common in patients younger than 50&#160;years. The formation of nuclear cataracts after vitrectomy is associated with increases in oxygen tension in the vitreous intraoperatively and postoperatively. (See Chapter&#160;3 for a discussion of oxygen tension in the lens.) Retinal surgery performed without vitrectomy is not associated with increased nuclear sclerosis, but any disturbance of the capsule during a vitreous cavity procedure may precipitate a PSC.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intravitreal injections may be associated with cataract formation either as a result of direct trauma to the lens or as an adverse effect of specific medications injected into the vitreous space.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Trabeculectomy is a known risk factor for development of visually significant cataract. The Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study found that glaucoma patients’ risk of needing early cataract surgery was 8&#160;times higher in those whose initial treatment was trabeculectomy than in those whose initial treatment was with medications. This risk decreased to 3&#160;times higher at 5&#160;years following trabeculectomy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nuclear sclerotic cataract formation also occurs at significantly higher rates after penetrating keratoplasty and Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty.</p>

			<p class="h2">Intralenticular Foreign Bodies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In rare instances, a small foreign body can perforate the cornea and the anterior lens capsule and become lodged within the lens. If the foreign body is not composed of a ferric or cupric material and the anterior lens capsule seals the perforation site, the foreign body may be retained within the lens without significant complication. Intralenticular foreign bodies may cause cataract formation in some cases but do not always lead to lens opacification.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Radiation</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Ionizing radiation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens is extremely sensitive to ionizing radiation; however, up to 20&#160;years may pass after exposure before a cataract becomes clinically apparent. This period of latency is related to the dose of radiation and to the patient’s age; younger patients are more susceptible because they have more lens cells that are actively growing. Ionizing radiation in the x-ray range (0.001–10.0-nm wavelength) can cause cataracts in some individuals in doses as low as 2&#160;Gy in one fraction. (A routine chest x-ray equals 0.01-Gy exposure to the thorax.) A single computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain may expose the lens to as much as 2.5–5&#160;cGy (100&#160;cGy = 1&#160;Gy).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The first clinical signs of radiation-&#173;induced cataract are often punctate opacities within the posterior capsule and feathery anterior subcapsular opacities that radiate toward the equator of the lens. These opacities may progress to complete opacification of the lens.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Infrared radiation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Exposure of the eye to infrared (IR) radiation and intense heat over time can cause the outer layers of the anterior lens capsule to peel off as a single layer. Such true exfoliation of the lens capsule, in which the exfoliated outer lamella tends to scroll up on itself, is rarely seen today. Cortical cataract may be associated with this condition, in which case it is known as <span class="italic">glassblower’s cataract.</span> (See the section Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome, later in this chapter.)</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Ultraviolet radiation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Experimental evidence suggests that the lens is susceptible to damage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that long-term exposure to sunlight is associated with an increased risk of cortical cataracts, perhaps more frequently in men than women. Although sunlight exposure accounts for only approximately 10% of the total risk of cortical cataract in the general population in temperate climates, this risk is avoidable. Because exposure to UV radiation can lead to other morbidity, clinicians should encourage their patients to avoid excessive sunlight exposure. Lenses sold in the United States must conform to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements aimed at reducing UV transmission. Using prescription corrective lenses and nonprescription sunglasses decreases UV exposure by more than 80%, and wearing a hat with a brim decreases ocular sun exposure by 30%–50%.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Metallosis</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Siderosis bulbi</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intraocular iron-&#173;containing foreign bodies can cause siderosis bulbi, a condition characterized by deposition of iron molecules in the trabecular meshwork, lens epithelium, iris, and retina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-14A</span>). The epithelium and cortical fibers of the affected lens at first show a yellowish tinge, followed by a rusty brown discoloration (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-14B</span>). Lens involvement occurs more rapidly if the retained foreign body is embedded close to the lens. Later manifestations of siderosis bulbi are complete cortical cataract formation and retinal dysfunction. (See also BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span>)</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Chalcosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chalcosis occurs when an intraocular foreign body deposits copper in the Descemet membrane, anterior lens capsule, or other intraocular basement membranes. The resulting <span class="italic">“sunflower” cataract</span> is a petal-&#173;shaped deposition of yellow or brown pigment in the lens capsule that radiates from the anterior axial pole of the lens to the equator. Usually, this cataract causes no significant loss of vision. However, intraocular foreign bodies containing almost pure copper (more than 90%) can cause a severe inflammatory reaction and intraocular necrosis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Electrical Injury</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Electrical shock can cause protein coagulation and cataract formation. Lens manifestations are more likely when the transmission of current involves the patient’s head. Initially, lens vacuoles appear in the anterior midperiphery of the lens, followed by linear opacities in the anterior subcapsular cortex. A cataract induced by an electrical injury may regress, remain stationary, or mature to complete cataract over months or years (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-15</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Chemical Injuries</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Alkali injuries to the ocular surface often result in cataract, in addition to damaging the cornea, conjunctiva, and iris. Alkali compounds penetrate the eye readily, causing an increase in aqueous pH and a decrease in the level of aqueous glucose and ascorbate. Cortical cataract formation may occur acutely or as a delayed effect of chemical injury. Because acid tends to penetrate the eye less easily than does alkali, acid injuries are less likely to result in cataract formation.</p>

			<p class="h1">Metabolic Cataract</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Diabetes Mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diabetes mellitus can affect lens clarity as well as the refractive index and accommodative amplitude of the lens. As the blood glucose level increases, so, too, does the glucose content in the aqueous humor. (See Chapter&#160;3 for a discussion of glucose-&#173;induced lens changes.) Acute myopic shifts may indicate undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Patients with type&#160;1 diabetes have a decreased amplitude of accommodation compared with age-&#173;matched controls, and presbyopia may present at a younger age in these patients.

			<p class="body-text">Cataract is a common cause of visual impairment in patients with diabetes mellitus. Acute <span class="italic">diabetic cataract,</span> or <span class="italic">“snowflake” cataract,</span> refers to bilateral, widespread subcapsular lens changes of abrupt onset and typically occurs in young individuals with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-16</span>). Multiple gray-white subcapsular opacities that have a snowflake appearance are seen initially in the superficial anterior and posterior lens cortex. Vacuoles and clefts form in the underlying cortex. Intumescence and maturity of the cortical cataract follow shortly thereafter. Although acute diabetic cataracts are rarely encountered in clinical practice today, rapidly maturing bilateral cortical cataracts in a child or young adult should alert the clinician to the possibility of diabetes mellitus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with diabetes mellitus develop age-&#173;related lens changes that are indistinguishable from nondiabetic age-&#173;related cataracts, except that these lens changes tend to occur at a younger age than in those without the disease. The increased risk or earlier onset of age-&#173;related cataracts in diabetic patients may be a result of the accumulation of sorbitol within the lens and accompanying changes in hydration, increased nonenzymatic glycosylation (glycation) of lens proteins, or greater oxidative stress from alterations in lens metabolism. These stressors may promote an increase in nuclear sclerotic cataract, cortical cataract, and PSC formation.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Galactosemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Galactosemia is an inherited autosomal recessive inability to convert galactose to glucose. As a consequence of this inability, excessive galactose accumulates in body tissues, with further metabolic conversion of galactose to galactitol (dulcitol), the sugar alcohol of galactose. Galactosemia can result from defects in 1 of 3&#160;enzymes involved in the metabolism of galactose: (1)&#160;galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (Gal-1-PUT), (2)&#160;galactokinase, or (3)&#160;uridine diphosphate galactose 4-epimerase (UDP-&#173;galactose 4-epimerase). The most common and the severest form, known as <span class="italic">classic galactosemia,</span> is caused by a defect in Gal-1-PUT.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In classic galactosemia, symptoms of malnutrition, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and intellectual deficiency present within the first few weeks of life. The disease is fatal if undiagnosed and untreated. The diagnosis of classic galactosemia can be confirmed by demonstration of galactose in the urine.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Typically, the nucleus and deep cortex become increasingly opacified, causing an “oil droplet” appearance on retroillumination (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-17</span>). The cataracts can progress to total opacification.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of galactosemia includes elimination of milk and milk products from the diet. In some cases, early cataract formation can be reversed by timely diagnosis and dietary intervention. This oil droplet appearance is similar to the oil droplet cataract of central nuclear sclerosis but differs markedly from the oil droplet cataract of posterior lenticonus. In posterior lenticonus, a bulge in the posterior capsule causes the oil droplet appearance on red reflex examination.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Hypocalcemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataracts may develop in association with any condition that results in hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia may be idiopathic, or it may occur as a result of unintended destruction of the parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery. Usually bilateral, hypocalcemic (tetanic) cataracts are punctate iridescent opacities in the anterior and posterior cortex. They lie beneath the lens capsule and are usually separated from it by a zone of clear lens. These discrete opacities may remain stable or may mature into complete cortical cataracts.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Wilson Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The characteristic ocular manifestation of Wilson disease is the Kayser-&#173;Fleischer ring, a golden-&#173;brown discoloration of the Descemet membrane around the periphery of the cornea. In addition, a characteristic sunflower cataract often develops. Reddish-&#173;brown pigment (cuprous oxide) is deposited in the anterior lens capsule and subcapsular cortex in a stellate shape that resembles the petals of a sunflower. In most cases, the sunflower cataract does not cause serious visual impairment.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Myotonic Dystrophy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Myotonic dystrophy is an inherited autosomal dominant condition characterized by delayed relaxation of contracted muscles, ptosis, weakness of the facial musculature, cardiac conduction defects, and prominent frontal balding in affected male patients. Patients with this disorder typically develop polychromatic iridescent crystals in the lens cortex (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-18</span>), with sequential PSC progressing to complete cortical opacification. Ultrastructurally, polychromatic iridescent crystals are composed of whorls of plasmalemma from the lens fibers. The crystals are occasionally seen in the lens cortex of patients who do not have myotonic dystrophy; these crystals are thought to be caused by cholesterol crystal deposition in the lens.</p>

			<p class="h1">Effects of Nutrition, Alcohol, and Smoking</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although nutritional deficiencies have been demonstrated to cause cataracts in animal models, this etiology has been difficult to confirm in humans. Numerous population-&#173;based studies have found that lower socioeconomic status, lower education level, and poorer overall nutrition are associated with increased prevalence of age-&#173;related cataracts. Severe episodes of dehydration caused by diarrhea may be linked to an increased risk of cataract formation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The identification of specific dietary deficiencies that lead to cataract formation and of supplements that protect against it has been more challenging. Some studies have suggested that taking multivitamin supplements, vitamin&#160;A, vitamin&#160;C, vitamin&#160;E, niacin, thiamine, riboflavin, or beta carotene or increasing protein intake may protect against cataract development. Several studies have suggested that the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin provide some protection against nuclear and cortical cataracts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS1) showed that, over 7&#160;years, increased intake of vitamins&#160;C and&#160;E and beta carotene did not decrease the development or progression of cataract. Likewise, the subsequent study (Age-&#173;Related Eye Disease Study&#160;2 [AREDS2]) showed no difference in the rates of cataract surgery among patients who took lutein and zeaxanthin supplements and those who did not.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is important to remember that high-dose vitamin use may pose risks. Smokers taking high doses of beta carotene have an increased risk of lung cancer, death from lung cancer, and death from cardiovascular disease. In addition, women taking supplemental doses of vitamin&#160;A have an increased risk of hip fracture.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Smoking, the use of smokeless tobacco products, and excessive alcohol consumption are significant, avoidable risk factors for cataract. In numerous studies performed worldwide, these practices have consistently been associated with an increase in the frequency of nuclear opacities. Although patients may know the general health risks of smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, they may not know about the risks of ocular conditions such as macular degeneration and cataract that are related to these practices. Ophthalmologists can inform their patients about these risks, and they are in a strong position to encourage individuals to stop smoking and reduce alcohol consumption.</p>

		   	<div id="Chapt5_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lens changes often occur as a result of chronic uveitis or associated corticosteroid therapy. Typically, a PSC develops; anterior lens changes may also occur. The formation of posterior synechiae is common in uveitis, often with thickening of the anterior lens capsule, which may have an associated fibrous pupillary membrane. Lens changes in cataract secondary to uveitis may progress to a mature cataract. Calcium deposits may be observed on the anterior capsule or within the lens substance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cortical cataract formation occurs in up to 70% of cases of Fuchs heterochromic uveitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-19</span>). Because posterior synechiae are uncommon in this syndrome, formation of pupillary membranes is unlikely, and long-term corticosteroid therapy is not indicated. Cataract extraction in patients with Fuchs heterochromic uveitis generally has a favorable prognosis. Intraoperative anterior chamber hemorrhage at the time of cataract surgery has been reported in approximately 25% of cases.</p>

			<p class="h1">Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is a systemic disease in which a matrix of fibrotic material is deposited in many bodily organs. In the eye, a basement membrane–like fibrillogranular white material is deposited on the cornea, iris, lens, anterior hyaloid face, ciliary processes, zonular fibers, and trabecular meshwork. These deposits, believed to comprise elastic microfibrils, appear as grayish-&#173;white flecks that are prominent at the pupillary margin and on the lens capsule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-20</span>). Associated with this condition are atrophy of the iris at the pupillary margin, deposition of pigment on the anterior surface of the iris, poorly dilating pupil, increased pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork, capsular fragility, zonular weakness, and open-&#173;angle glaucoma. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is a unilateral or bilateral disorder that becomes more apparent with increasing age. An association between lifetime UV-light exposure and the development of pseudoexfoliation syndrome has recently been documented.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Increased oxidative stress caused by abnormalities in transforming growth factor&#160;<span class="greek--tx-">b</span> (TGF-<span class="greek--tx-">b</span>) contributes to the formation of cataracts. Patients with this syndrome may also experience weakness of the zonular fibers and spontaneous lens subluxation and phacodonesis. Poor zonular integrity may affect cataract surgery technique and intraocular lens implantation. (See Chapter&#160;9 for a discussion of cataract surgery in special situations.) The exfoliative material may be produced even after the crystalline lens is removed.</p>

Cataract formation has been reported in up to 25% of patients with atopic dermatitis. The cataracts are usually bilateral, and onset occurs in the second to third decade of life.

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-12">Phacoantigenic Uveitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top10">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the normal eye, minute quantities of lens proteins leak out through the lens capsule. The eye appears to have immunologic tolerance to these small numbers of lens antigens. However, the release of a large quantity of lens proteins into the anterior chamber disrupts this immunologic tolerance and may trigger a severe inflammatory reaction. Phacoantigenic uveitis, previously termed <span class="italic">phacoanaphylactic endophthalmitis,</span> is an immune-&#173;mediated granulomatous inflammation initiated by lens proteins released through a ruptured lens capsule. This condition usually occurs following traumatic rupture of the lens capsule or following cataract surgery when cortical material is retained within the eye. Onset occurs days to weeks after the injury or surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This disease is characterized by a red, painful eye with injection, chemosis, and anterior chamber inflammation with cells, flare, and keratic precipitates. Occasionally, glaucoma develops due to obstruction of the trabecular meshwork and formation of synechiae. Late complications include cyclitic membrane, hypotony, and phthisis bulbi. In rare instances, phacoantigenic uveitis can give rise to an inflammatory reaction in the fellow eye. Histologic examination shows a zonal granulomatous inflammation surrounding a breach of the lens capsule. Lens extraction is the definitive therapy for this condition.

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Phacolytic Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phacolytic glaucoma is a complication of a mature or hypermature cataract. Denatured, liquefied high-&#173;molecular-mass lens proteins leak through an intact but permeable lens capsule. An immune response is not elicited; rather, macrophages ingest these lens proteins. The trabecular meshwork becomes clogged with both the lens proteins and the engorged macrophages. The usual clinical presentation of phacolytic glaucoma consists of abrupt onset of pain and redness in a cataractous eye that has had poor vision for some time. The cornea may be edematous, and significant flare reaction occurs in the anterior chamber. The lack of keratic precipitates helps distinguish phacolytic glaucoma from phacoantigenic glaucoma. White flocculent material appears in the anterior chamber and often adheres to the lens capsule as well. IOP is markedly elevated, and the anterior chamber angle is open, although the same material may be seen in the trabecular meshwork. Initial treatment of phacolytic glaucoma consists of controlling the IOP with ocular hypotensive medications and managing the inflammation with topical corticosteroids. Surgical removal of the lens is the definitive treatment.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Lens Particle Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Following a penetrating lens injury or surgical procedure (ie, extracapsular cataract extraction, phacoemulsification with retained cortical material, or in rare instances, Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy), particles of lens cortex may migrate into the anterior chamber, where they obstruct aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. In most instances, glaucoma occurs within weeks of the initial surgery or trauma, but it may occur months or years later. Gonioscopy shows that the angle is open, and cortical material can often be seen deposited along the trabecular meshwork. Medical therapy to lower IOP and to reduce intraocular inflammation is indicated. If the IOP and inflammation do not respond quickly to this treatment, surgical removal of the retained lens material may be required.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Phacomorphic Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As the lens grows in the anterior–posterior dimension it can cause pupillary block and induce secondary angle-&#173;closure glaucoma, or it can physically push the iris forward and thus cause shallowing of the anterior chamber. Often, the patient presents with a red, painful eye and a history of vision changes as a result of cataract formation prior to the acute event (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-21</span>). The cornea may be edematous, and gonioscopy reveals a closed anterior chamber angle. Initial management includes medical treatment to lower the IOP. The condition responds to laser iridotomy, but definitive treatment consists of cataract extraction.</p>
