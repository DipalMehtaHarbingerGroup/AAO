			<p class="chapter-title">Evaluation and Management of Cataracts in Adults</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An ophthalmologist evaluating a patient with cataracts must assess the degree to which the lens opacity affects vision and determine whether surgery will improve the patient’s quality of life. The following questions should be considered in the evaluation and management of cataract:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">What is the functional impact of the cataract?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">What are the morphological characteristics of the cataract?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Is surgery indicated either to improve the patient’s quality of life or to aid in the management of other ocular conditions?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">What are the patient’s expectations regarding the refractive results of surgery?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Does the patient have ocular or systemic comorbidities that might affect the decision to proceed with surgery or alter the management plan?</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">What are the possible barriers to obtaining informed consent or to ensuring good postoperative care?</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In most cases, cataract surgery is an elective procedure. Thus, in addition to answering the preceding questions, the ophthalmologist should inform the patient about the impact of the cataract, the risks and benefits of surgical management, the alternatives to surgery, and the options regarding the intraocular lens (IOL) to be used if surgery takes place. Ultimately, it is important that both patient and physician be satisfied that surgery is the appropriate choice for improving vision.</p>
			<p class="h1">Clinical History: Signs and Symptoms</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top1">
			<p class="h2-h1">Decreased Visual Acuity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Often, the clinical history of a patient with decreased vision and function due to cataract is straightforward, and the patient tells the ophthalmologist which activities have been curtailed or abandoned. Some patients, however, learn of their decline in visual acuity only after being examined. Others deny that they are having any problems until their limitations are demonstrated or privileges are withdrawn because they are no longer visually competent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Different types of cataract may have different effects on visual acuity, depending on incident light, pupil size, and refractive error (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-1</span>). The presence of even small posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSCs) can greatly disturb near visual acuity (reading vision) without necessarily affecting distance vision. Color vision disturbances may be noted by the patient, especially with unilateral or asymmetric cataract.</p>
			<p class="h2">Glare and Altered Contrast Sensitivity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataract patients often report an increase in glare, which may vary from increased photosensitivity in brightly lit environments to disabling glare in the daytime or with headlights from oncoming cars. Shorter wavelengths of light cause the most scatter; the color, intensity, and direction of lighting also affect glare. This increased sensitivity is particularly prominent with PSCs and, occasionally, with anterior cortical lens changes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Contrast sensitivity is the ability to detect subtle variations in shading. Because patients with ocular abnormalities have altered contrast sensitivity in low light, measurement of contrast sensitivity may provide a more comprehensive estimate of the visual resolution of the eye. A significant loss in contrast sensitivity may occur without a similar loss in Snellen acuity. However, abnormal contrast sensitivity is not a specific indicator of vision loss due to cataract.</p>
			<p class="h2">Myopic Shift</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The development of cataract may increase the dioptric power of the lens, commonly causing a mild to moderate degree of myopic shift. Hyperopic and emmetropic patients find that their need for distance or reading spectacles diminishes as they experience this “second sight.” This phenomenon is encountered with nuclear sclerotic cataracts and disappears when the optical clarity of the crystalline lens further deteriorates. Less commonly, hyperopic or astigmatic refractive errors can be induced by cataractous lens changes. Asymmetric development of lens-&#173;induced myopia may produce intolerable anisometropia.</p>
			<p class="h2">Monocular Diplopia or Polyopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Occasionally in cataractous eyes, nuclear changes are localized to the inner layers of the lens nucleus, resulting in multiple refractile areas at the center of the lens. Such areas may best be seen as irregularities in the red reflex on retinoscopy or direct ophthalmoscopy. This type of cataract can result in monocular diplopia or polyopia, including ghost images and occasionally a true second image. Monocular diplopia can also occur with other ocular media opacities or other disorders of the eye (see BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Decreased Visual Function</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Assessing the overall effect of the cataract on visual function is almost certainly a more appropriate way to determine visual disability than is acuity testing alone. Patients should be asked whether their vision (at near, at distance, and under different lighting conditions) is adequate to allow them to perform relevant activities of daily living and participate in any hobbies. While no one test can comprehensively assess the effects of a cataract, questionnaires for measuring visual function may be useful. These include the Activities of Daily Vision Scale (ADVS), the Visual Function Index (VF-14), the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ), and the Visual Disability Assessment (VDA).</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Nonsurgical Management</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nonsurgical approaches may be attempted to improve visual function in cataract patients who do not desire surgery and in those for whom surgical management is not feasible. Careful refraction may improve spectacle correction for distance and near vision. For example, patients who have experienced a myopic shift secondary to cataract may hold reading material closer and may not report symptoms until a change in their glasses is made; a corresponding increase in the power added for near vision is necessary. Use of specialized tints may reduce glare, and brighter illumination can improve the contrast of reading material. Handheld monoculars may facilitate spotting objects at a distance; high-plus spectacles, magnifiers, closed-&#173;circuit televisions, and telescopic loupes may be used for reading and close work.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Referral to low vision services may be appropriate. For patients whose visual function could be aided or enhanced by vision rehabilitation, the American Academy of Ophthalmology provides the SmartSight initiative, which is available at www.aao.org<br />/smart-sight-low-vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with small axial cataracts, pupillary dilation, achieved either pharmacologically or by laser pupilloplasty, may improve visual function by allowing more light to pass through peripheral portions of the lens. However, there is a risk of inducing additional glare with this approach.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pharmacologic reversal of cataracts is a subject of ongoing research. No commercially available medication has been proven to delay or reverse cataract formation in humans. Aldose reductase inhibitors, which block the conversion of glucose to sorbitol, have been shown to prevent cataracts in animals with experimentally induced diabetes mellitus. However, studies in humans show no such effect. Antioxidants such as zinc and beta carotene and vitamins E and C do not slow cataract progression.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Indications for Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common indication for cataract surgery is the patient’s desire for improved vision. The decision to operate is not based solely on a specific level of reduced acuity. Key to the decision is determining whether the patient’s visual function would improve enough to warrant cataract surgery. Some governmental agencies and industries have minimum standards of visual function for their workers for tasks such as driving, flying, and operating complex equipment. A patient whose best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA) does not meet these visual requisites may need to consider cataract surgery. The ophthalmic surgeon must determine, through discussion with the patient and family and analysis of the results of subjective and objective testing, whether cataract surgery is advisable.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To approve reimbursement for cataract surgery, some third-&#173;party payers require that patients have a certain level of vision loss; in such cases, glare testing may be useful for documenting loss of visual function beyond that measured by Snellen acuity. In some cases, patients have lens changes that cause unwanted refractive errors or symptoms but do not meet criteria for third-&#173;party reimbursement. After a careful discussion of the risks, benefits, alternatives, and costs, surgery may be offered to patients who would benefit from the procedure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Medical indications for cataract surgery include phacolytic glaucoma, phacomorphic glaucoma, phacoantigenic uveitis, and dislocation of the lens. An additional indication for surgery is the presence of a cataract sufficiently opaque to obscure the view of the fundus and impair the diagnosis or management of other ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, or glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cataract in elderly persons, especially those with significant deafness or early dementia, may lead to isolation. The quality of life of such patients may be greatly improved with spectacle independence following cataract surgery. Also, cataract extraction has been shown to decrease the frequency of falls and hip fractures and to reduce morbidity and mortality.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Common indications for surgery in a patient with a monocular cataract include loss of stereopsis, diminished peripheral vision, disabling glare, and symptomatic anisometropia. The presence of cataract in one&#160;eye has a negative effect on driving performance and accident avoidance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When a patient has bilateral, visually significant cataracts, surgery is usually performed first in the eye with the more advanced cataract. In patients with active or severe systemic illness, or in those with other ocular diseases contributing to decreased vision, it may be appropriate to operate first on the eye with better visual potential, should only one&#160;surgical procedure be anticipated. Other strategies to facilitate patient adaptation include operating on the dominant eye or the more ametropic eye first.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After undergoing second-eye cataract surgery, patients have been shown to experience significant improvements not only in acuity and satisfaction with their vision but also in measures of bilateral visual function, such as stereopsis and contrast sensitivity. But the decision of whether to proceed with cataract surgery on the second eye must be individualized to the patient’s needs and visual potential, just as it was for the first eye. One consideration is the development of symptomatic anisometropia, which may occur as a result of the initial cataract surgery. The anisometropia may be unsatisfactorily addressed by nonsurgical treatment, and the patient may find it disabling enough to justify surgery on the second eye, even if the cataract is at an early stage of development.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Before proceeding with the second surgery, the physician and the patient traditionally allow sufficient time to confirm the success and safety of the first operation and to assess the refractive outcome. Interest has recently increased in immediate sequential (same-day) bilateral cataract surgery. Most ophthalmologists do not use this approach because of the potential for bilateral complications and the inability to incorporate information regarding refractive outcome into planning for the second eye. However, it may be a viable option for patients who are unable to return for second-&#173;eye surgery and for those who have limited access to surgical resources. Some patients with high refractive errors may voice a preference for immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery to avoid functional impairment due to anisometropia between procedures. If same-day surgery is performed, the surgeon should treat each eye as an entirely separate case by using new gloves, draping, instruments, and equipment.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Preoperative Evaluation</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician should obtain the following information to determine whether cataract surgery is advisable. The parameters suggested should be tailored to the individual patient.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">General Health of the Patient</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A complete medical history is the starting point for the preoperative evaluation. The ophthalmologist should work with the patient’s primary care physician to achieve optimal management of all medical problems, especially diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bleeding disorders, or adrenal suppression caused by systemic corticosteroid use. The ophthalmologist should be aware of the patient’s drug sensitivities and use of medications that might alter the outcome of surgery, such as immunosuppressants and anticoagulants. Given the low risk of hemorrhage with topical anesthesia and clear corneal incisions, anticoagulant medications do not need to be discontinued prior to cataract surgery. Any alteration in the patient’s use of these medications is ideally done in consultation with the prescribing physician.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist should specifically ask about the use of systemic <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-adrenergic antagonist medications (including prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, silodosin, alfuzosin, and tamsulosin, as well as herbal supplements, such as saw palmetto) for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary incontinence, urolithiasis, and hypertension. These medications are strongly associated with intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) and fluctuations in pupil size. All <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-blockers can bind to postsynaptic nerve endings of the iris dilator muscle for a prolonged period, causing excessive iris mobility. This effect may occur after only 1&#160;dose of the medication and may persist indefinitely, even after discontinuation of the drug. Anecdotal reports document potential <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-&#173;antagonist properties and potential associations with IFIS in other medications, including certain antipsychotic and antihypertensive medications. See Chapter&#160;8 for further discussion of IFIS.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist should inquire about and document any allergies, adverse reactions, and sensitivities to sedatives, narcotics, anesthetics, povidone-&#173;iodine, and latex. Factors limiting the patient’s ability to cooperate in the operating room or to lie comfortably on the operating room table (eg, deafness, language barriers, dementia, claustrophobia, restless legs syndrome, head tremor, musculoskeletal disorders) will influence the choice of anesthesia and the surgical plan.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The extent of the formal medical preoperative evaluation should be based on the patient’s overall health and may be guided by requirements of the facility where the procedure is to take place. Screening with self-&#173;reported information gained from health questionnaires may help identify patients who are at higher risk for medical difficulties related to surgery, but this method should not be the only form of evaluation. Certainly, for all patients with risk factors related to their ability to undergo surgery, a history should be obtained and a physical examination and relevant laboratory work should be performed. However, routine medical testing before cataract surgery has not been shown to increase the safety of the procedure.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Pertinent Ocular History</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ocular history will help the ophthalmologist identify conditions that could affect the surgical approach and the visual prognosis. Trauma, inflammation, amblyopia, glaucoma, optic nerve abnormalities, or retinal disease might affect the visual outcome after cataract removal. In addition, an understanding of the patient’s history of refractive error and spectacle or contact lens correction, as well as the patient’s experience with monovision or progressive lenses, may aid refractive planning for cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Active uveitis should be controlled before cataract surgery so that the risk of complications from postoperative inflammation, such as macular edema and iris adhesion to the lens implant, can be minimized. Ideally, the eye is quiet without the use of topical corticosteroids for at least 3&#160;months before surgery. Some eyes may require sustained use of topical corticosteroids even up to the time of surgery. Also, surgery may be needed before the clinician is able to get the eye completely quiet. Systemic immunomodulation may be necessary to achieve remission. The presence of zonular abnormalities, fibrin membranes, and posterior synechiae will require the surgeon to adjust his or her surgical technique, as discussed in Chapter&#160;9.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A family history of retinal detachment or a history of retinal pathology in either of the patient’s eyes is a risk factor for postoperative retinal detachment. Previous vitrectomy for the treatment of retinal disease or vitreous hemorrhage may cause intraoperative chamber fluctuations, which increase the risk of posterior capsule disruption and loss of nuclear fragments posteriorly.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In glaucoma patients, optimal control of intraocular pressure (IOP) should be achieved prior to cataract surgery. If this cannot be accomplished, the surgeon may wish to consider a combined operation (cataract surgery along with an intervention to lower IOP). New techniques combining cataract surgery with microinvasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) may offer benefits of reducing medications while maintaining a risk profile similar to cataract surgery alone. See Chapter&#160;9 in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Past records document the patient’s visual acuity before the development of cataract. If the patient has had cataract surgery in the fellow eye, it is important to obtain information about the operative and postoperative course. If problems such as IFIS, elevated IOP, vitreous loss, cystoid macular edema, endophthalmitis, hemorrhage, or a refractive surprise occurred during or after the first operation, the surgical approach and postoperative follow-&#173;up could be modified for the second eye in order to reduce the risk of similar complications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the patient previously had refractive surgery, it is helpful to perform additional ocular measurements prior to and after the cataract surgery. See Chapter&#160;9.</p>

			<p class="h2">Social History</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As discussed earlier, the decision to undertake cataract surgery is based not only on the patient’s visual acuity but also on the ramifications of reduced vision on the individual’s quality of life. The surgeon should be aware of the patient’s occupation, hobbies, lifestyle, and any possible chemical dependencies, including nicotine and illicit (recreational) drugs, as all of these may affect postoperative recovery. Any surrogate decision makers must be identified and included in preoperative planning.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Measurements of Visual Function</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Visual Acuity Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is useful to measure Snellen acuity under lighted and darkened examination conditions. Although visual acuity testing in the ophthalmologist’s office is commonly performed in a darkened room, diminished Snellen acuity from a symptomatic cataract is sometimes demonstrated only in a lighted room. Distance and near visual acuity must be tested and careful refraction performed so that BCVA can be determined. Visual acuity may improve after pupillary dilation, especially in patients with a PSC.</p>
			<p class="h2">Refraction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Careful refraction must be performed on both eyes. This assessment is useful for calculating the IOL power necessary to obtain the desired postoperative refraction, as well as for determining whether a myopic shift has occurred. If the fellow eye has a clear lens and a high refractive error that requires correction, achieving emmetropia in the surgical eye might cause problems with postoperative anisometropia. The ophthalmologist should inform the patient specifically about this possibility and discuss options including refractive surgery or use of a contact lens for the noncataractous eye. Aiming for a similar myopic refractive result in the fellow eye is one option, but this will ensure long-term dependence on refractive correction. A planned monovision outcome may optimize spectacle independence, but the patient either must have experience with monovision or must be tested to find out whether adapting to unequal refractive errors will be tolerated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Rigid contact lens overrefraction is a useful technique to assess the degree to which irregular astigmatism or other corneal irregularity is contributing to a patient’s visual disability.</p>
			<p class="h2">Glare Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Glare testing attempts to measure the degree of visual impairment caused by the presence of a light source located in the patient’s visual field. Testing can be done with a nonprojected eye chart in ambient light conditions or with a projected eye chart and an off-&#173;axis bright light directed at the patient. Various instruments are available to standardize and facilitate this measurement. Patients with significant cataracts commonly show a decrease of 3 or more lines under these conditions, compared with results obtained when visual acuity is tested in a darkened room. Performing this assessment before the patient’s pupils are dilated is recommended, as studies have shown that visual acuity decreases significantly when testing is performed after dilation. Results of any testing done after pupillary dilation must be adjusted to account for the related decrease in acuity.</p>

			<p class="h2">Contrast Sensitivity Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with cataracts may experience diminished contrast sensitivity even when Snellen acuity is preserved. Various specialized charts have been developed to test contrast sensitivity in the ophthalmologist’s office. Some charts are mounted on a wall; others are handheld or incorporate the use of a monitor. Certain contrast sensitivity charts feature sine wave gratings to allow evaluation of different spatial frequencies. However, no instrument is currently considered the standard for contrast sensitivity testing. Of note, contrast sensitivity may be decreased by a wide variety of ophthalmic conditions affecting the cornea, optic nerve, and retina. It is therefore essential that the ophthalmologist identify any comorbidities before attributing an irregularity in test results solely to cataract.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-10">External Examination</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The preoperative evaluation of a patient with cataract should include the body habitus and any abnormalities of the external eye and ocular adnexa. Such conditions as extensive supraclavicular fat, kyphosis, ankylosing spondylitis, generalized obesity, or head tremor may affect the surgical approach. The presence of enophthalmos or prominent brow may affect not only the surgical approach but also the chosen route of anesthesia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Entropion, ectropion, or eyelid closure abnormalities, as well as abnormalities in the tear film, may have an impact on the ocular surface and thus adversely affect postoperative recovery if not addressed preoperatively. Severe blepharitis or acne rosacea may pose an increased risk of endophthalmitis and should likewise be treated before cataract surgery. Active nasolacrimal disease should also be treated, particularly if there is a history of inflammation, infection, or obstruction.</p>
			<p class="h2">Motility</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ophthalmologist should evaluate ocular alignment and test the range of movement of the extraocular muscles. Cover testing should be performed to document any muscle deviation. Abnormal motility may suggest preexisting strabismus with amblyopia as a cause of vision loss. Patients must be made aware that they may experience diplopia after cataract surgery if they have a significant tropia resulting in disruption of fusion. Also, removal of a dense cataract may improve vision but make the patient aware of ocular misalignment.</p>
			<p class="h2">Pupils</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition to checking direct and consensual constriction of the pupil to light, the ophthalmologist should perform the swinging flashlight test to detect a <span class="italic">relative afferent pupillary defect</span> (<span class="italic">RAPD;</span> also known as a <span class="italic">Marcus Gunn pupil</span>), the presence of which indicates extensive retinal disease or optic nerve dysfunction. (See also BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span>) Although the vision of a patient with RAPD in the cataractous eye may improve after cataract surgery, the visual outcome may be limited by optic nerve dysfunction. The patient must be made aware of the possibility of less than complete restoration of vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is important to measure the size of the pupil under different lighting conditions, because this information may affect selection of the IOL. For example, small-&#173;optic lenses may be inappropriate for a patient who has a large pupil in moderate or dim illumination. The edge of the optic can fall inside the pupil border, allowing light to pass around the optic edge, with resultant glare or dysphotopsias. Also, the function of a multifocal IOL may be affected by a pupil that is small, atonic, or eccentric. It is helpful to assess pupil size before and after dilation, because the risk of surgical complications is higher in small pupils that do not dilate adequately (eg, in patients with diabetes mellitus, posterior synechiae, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or a history of systemic <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-&#173;adrenergic antagonist or long-term topical miotic use); in such cases, the surgeon may need to use expansion techniques. These techniques are discussed in Chapters&#160;7 and&#160;9.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-11">Slit-Lamp Examination</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top7">
			<p class="h2-h1">Conjunctiva</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vascularization or scarring of the conjunctiva due to previous inflammation, injury, or ocular surgery may indicate compromised healing and limit surgical exposure. Symblepharon or shortening of the fornices may be associated with underlying systemic or ocular surface diseases. Infectious processes should receive appropriate treatment before cataract surgery in order to ensure optimal postoperative healing.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Cornea</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician should assess corneal thickness and look for the presence of corneal dystrophy, as abnormalities could increase the risk of poor healing and decompensation postoperatively. Preoperative corneal thickness greater than 640&#160;µm is associated with a higher risk of postoperative corneal decompensation. Specular reflection with the slit lamp may provide an estimate of the endothelial cell count and information regarding cell morphology. Descemet membrane irregularity associated with cornea guttae, as well as any central opacity, may affect the surgeon’s view of the lens during surgery and limit visual acuity after surgery. In patients with pannus due to long-term contact lens use or other conditions, the surgeon should plan to avoid making corneal incisions in areas of vascularization, if possible. Also, weakened or thinned areas in the cornea should be identified so that they can be avoided intraoperatively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ocular surface is the first and principal refracting interface of the eye. Tear film quantity and quality are thus critical to visual results. Diagnosis and management of keratitis sicca, blepharitis, and epithelial basement membrane dystrophy are of critical importance in cataract patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Areas of scarring possibly consistent with a history of herpetic eye disease should prompt further questioning of the patient, as prophylactic antiviral medication and careful monitoring of steroid therapy in the perioperative period may be advisable to prevent reactivation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the patient has undergone previous corneal refractive surgery, the surgeon should document the placement of radial or astigmatic incisions, as well as any apparent problems with healing. If the patient has undergone previous radial keratotomy (RK), the surgeon must take care to develop a surgical plan that avoids corneal splitting at the site of the RK incisions. See also Chapter&#160;9 in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;13, <span class="italic">Refractive Surgery.</span></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Anterior Chamber and Iris</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Knowing the depth of the anterior chamber and the axial thickness of the lens aids in surgical planning. A shallow anterior chamber may indicate anatomically narrow angles, nanophthalmos, short axial length, an intumescent lens, or a weak lens zonule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinician should consider performing gonioscopy preoperatively to rule out angle abnormalities, including peripheral anterior synechiae, neovascularization, or a prominent major arterial circle. Use of a 3-mirror lens helps in the evaluation of the lens zonule for traumatic or congenital dehiscence. Gonioscopy is essential if anterior chamber IOL implantation is anticipated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The presence of iridodonesis or exfoliation at the margin of the undilated pupil indicates weakened or absent zonular attachments and may affect the surgical plan. In addition, careful examination of the iris is important, as iris coloboma is often accompanied by lens coloboma and localized absence of zonular attachments.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Crystalline Lens</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician should carefully note the appearance of the lens both before and after dilation of the pupil. The impact of “oil droplet” nuclear cataracts and small PSCs is most closely correlated with visual symptoms before pupil dilation. After dilation, nuclear density can be evaluated, pseudoexfoliation syndrome can be detected, and opacities and distortion of the retinoscopic reflex can be visualized more easily.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To assess the lenticular contribution to the visual deficit, the clinician should evaluate the clarity of the media in the visual axis with the slit lamp. Dense, brunescent nuclear sclerotic cataracts may permit remarkably good vision, especially at near, whereas vacuolar cataracts, which may be detected by red reflex examination, can cause surprisingly severe vision loss. When dense cortical opacification is present, the intraoperative use of capsular dye to enhance visualization of the capsulorrhexis should be considered. The presence of a congenital posterior polar opacity is associated with a significant risk of capsule rupture and should be identified before surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The position of the lens and the integrity of the zonular fibers should also be evaluated. Lens coloboma, lens decentration, phacodonesis, or excessive distance between the lens and the pupillary margin indicates zonular disruption due to conditions such as lens subluxation as a result of previous trauma, metabolic disorders, or hypermature cataract. An indentation or flattening of the lens periphery may indicate focal loss of zonular support. For patients with these types of zonular disruption, the surgeon should be prepared to alter surgical technique, including by using capsular tension rings or other capsular or iris support devices intraoperatively (see Chapter&#160;9).</p>

			<p class="h2">Limitations of Slit-Lamp Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some visually significant cataracts may appear minimal on slit-lamp biomicroscopy. However, examination of the lens with the retinoscope may clarify the lenticular contribution to the patient’s vision changes. By examining the retinoscopic reflex, the clinician may detect posterior subcapsular opacities, refractile nuclear changes, or even diffuse cataracts. Similarly, examination using the direct ophthalmoscope through a +10.00&#160;D lens at a distance of 2&#160;ft will enhance the portions of the cataractous lens that are producing optical aberrations. This technique is particularly useful for identifying oil droplet cataracts.</p>

			<div id="Chapt6_Top8">
			<p class="h2-h1">Ophthalmoscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ophthalmologist must perform a full fundus examination to evaluate the macula, optic nerve, vitreous, retinal vessels, and retinal periphery. Particular attention should be paid to early macular degeneration or other maculopathy that may limit visual outcome after an otherwise uneventful cataract extraction. The indirect ophthalmoscope is not useful for judging the visual significance of cataract. Although the direct ophthalmoscope, retinal contact lens, and noncontact fundus lens are more useful in judging media clarity, the ophthalmologist must keep in mind that they, too, provide light that is more intense than that available to the patient under ambient lighting conditions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with diabetes mellitus should be examined carefully for the presence of macular edema, retinal ischemia, and background and proliferative retinopathy. Even in uncomplicated cataract surgery and in patients with minimal or no retinopathy, diabetic eye disease can progress postoperatively. Retinal ischemia may potentiate posterior or anterior neovascularization postoperatively, especially if the surgeon uses an intracapsular technique or ruptures the posterior capsule during extracapsular cataract extraction. Careful examination of the retinal periphery may reveal the presence of vitreoretinal traction or preexisting retinal holes and lattice degeneration that may warrant preoperative treatment.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ophthalmologist should examine the optic nerve for cupping and pallor, as well as other abnormalities.

			<p class="h2">Fundus Evaluation With Opaque Media</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">B-scan ultrasonography of the posterior segment of the eye is useful whenever a dense cataract makes visualization of the retina impossible. Ultrasonography can elucidate whether a retinal detachment, vitreous opacity, posterior pole tumor, or staphyloma is present. (See also BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics.</span>) Tests such as light projection, 2-point discrimination, gross color vision, photostress recovery, blue-light entoptoscopy, or the Maddox rod test may also be useful in detecting retinal pathology. Electroretinography and visually evoked response testing are warranted when other modalities are inconclusive and the surgeon must decide whether cataract removal would provide any benefit.</p>

			<div id="Chapt6_Top9">
			<p class="h2-h1">Potential Acuity Estimation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Potential acuity estimation can be helpful in assessing the lenticular contribution to vision loss. The potential acuity pinhole test is a simple but accurate method of evaluation for patients who do not have other ocular pathology and whose visual acuity is better than 20/200. For this test, the patient is asked to read a brightly illuminated near card through a pinhole aperture. The Retinal Acuity Meter, or RAM (AMA Optics, Miami Beach, FL), functions in a similar manner.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Potential Acuity Meter, or PAM (Mentor Graphics/Marco, Jacksonville, FL), is one of several instruments that project a numerical or Snellen vision chart through a small entrance pupil. The image can be projected onto the retina, around lenticular opacities, allowing for an estimate of what the BCVA would be if the media abnormality were absent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is important to note that these tests can be misleading in the presence of several disorders, including age-related macular degeneration, amblyopia, macular edema, glaucoma, small macular scars, and serous retinal detachment. An accurate clinical examination of the eye is often the best predictor of visual outcome.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Visual Field Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Confrontation field testing should be performed in all cataract patients; however, formal visual field testing is not indicated for every patient with lens opacity. Visual field testing may help the ophthalmologist identify vision loss resulting from disease processes other than cataract. Patients with a history of glaucoma, optic nerve disease, or retinal abnormality may benefit from visual field evaluation to document the degree of visual field loss. Preoperative visual field loss does not preclude improvement in visual function following cataract surgery. Progressive cataracts may induce diffuse visual field depression that disappears after cataract removal.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Objective Tests of Macular Function</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optical coherence tomography is increasingly performed as part of the preoperative testing regimen for cataract surgery in the United States. It may be useful in the assessment or detection of macular pathology, including neovascularization, edema, holes, and traction. Screening macular OCT to detect occult macular pathology may be of particular benefit for patients undergoing surgery with premium IOLs or when the vision is poorer than the degree of cataract would suggest.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-14">Preoperative Measurements</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top10">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Accurate preoperative measurements of the eye are essential to achieving the desired postoperative refractive result.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Biometry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular axial length (AL) is a key component of IOL power calculations, discussed later in this chapter. Several techniques are available to measure AL. No matter which is used, it is helpful to obtain data for both eyes, even if surgery is planned for only 1&#160;eye. The difference in AL between the 2&#160;eyes should be no greater than 0.3&#160;mm, unless there is a refractive difference or there are other relevant ocular findings. The clinician should document any significant disparity in&#160;AL.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Optical biometers are noncontact instruments that use optical coherence reflectometry instead of ultrasound to measure multiple parameters, such as AL, corneal curvature, anterior chamber depth, and horizontal white-to-white distance (corneal diameter). Because the level of patient cooperation varies, the technician or physician performing biometry should be adept at working with patients to obtain the most accurate measurements. Biometers are optical devices; therefore, measurements may be confounded by corneal scarring, mature or posterior subcapsular cataracts, or vitreous hemorrhage. <span class="italic">A-scan ultrasonography</span> measures AL by using either an immersion technique (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-1</span>) or a contact applanation method. With the immersion technique, a shell is placed on the eye between the eyelids to provide a watertight seal over the cornea. An ultrasound transducer is mounted in the shell. With the contact applanation method, the examiner must be careful not to compress the cornea, because corneal compression results in an artificially shortened AL measurement. Though generally not clinically significant in the patient with an “average” refraction, such errors become more important in patients with high hyperopia (AL of 20&#160;mm or less); in the short eyes of these patients, each millimeter of error results in up to 3.75&#160;D of inaccuracy in IOL power. The immersion technique avoids this problem.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Note that ultrasonographic measurement of AL is actually determined by calculation. The ultrasonic biometer measures the transit time of the ultrasound pulse. Using an estimated average velocity through the various ocular media (cornea, aqueous, lens, and vitreous), the biometric software calculates the AL. This value should be altered when velocities differ from the norm. For example, in performing AL measurements in a patient with silicone oil in the posterior chamber, the clinician must take into account the different velocity of sound waves in vitreous (1532 m/s) and in silicone oil (980 m/s), as well as the change in transit time, which is extended when silicone oil is present. Also, the index of refraction of silicone oil is much lower than that of vitreous; thus, the refractive index&#160;of the oil (and the design of the IOL) must be figured into IOL calculations for these eyes.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topography provides a map of the corneal contour. Various methods, including Placido disk–based topography, Scheimpflug imaging, or light-&#173;emitting diode (LED) reflection, provide additional information about the corneal surface and power. Corneal topography is particularly helpful if the patient has irregular astigmatism or early keratoconus, has previously undergone keratorefractive surgery, desires a toric or presbyopic IOL, or might benefit from astigmatism-&#173;correcting corneal incisions. Posterior corneal astigmatism, which is difficult to measure, is increasingly recognized as an important factor in refractive surprises following IOL surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal power calculations are problematic in eyes that have undergone refractive surgery, since traditional measures assume a particular relationship between anterior and posterior curvature. Laser refractive surgery modifies this relationship by altering the anterior curvature.</p>

			<p class="h2">Additional Evaluation of the Cornea</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In patients with a history of endothelial dystrophy, previous ocular surgery, or trauma, additional corneal measurements may be useful. These data may aid the surgeon in counseling the patient regarding the possibility of postoperative corneal decompensation. In some cases, consideration of a combined surgery incorporating removal of the cataract and transplantation of corneal tissue may be in order.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Corneal pachymetry,</span> a method employed to measure corneal thickness, is useful for indirectly assessing the function of the endothelium. Significantly increased central corneal thickness (&gt;640&#160;µm) in patients with endothelial dysfunction is associated with a greater risk of postoperative corneal decompensation.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Specular microscopy</span> is used to determine the number of corneal endothelial cells per square millimeter and evaluate their regularity. Because cataract surgery results in some loss of endothelial cells, the risk of postoperative corneal decompensation is increased if the preoperative endothelial cell count is low. Abnormal endothelial cell morphology, including enlargement (polymegathism) and irregularity (pleomorphism), may limit the cornea’s ability to withstand stress.

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-16">IOL Power Determination</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top11">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Formulas used for calculating the appropriate IOL power are based on the refracting power of the cornea, the anticipated postoperative distance between the anterior surface of the cornea and the anterior surface of the IOL (anterior chamber depth), and the AL of the eye. The refracting power of the cornea is determined by keratometry (manual or automatic) or by optical coherence biometry.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anterior chamber depth is estimated from measurements made on eyes with implants similar to the style of IOL to be used, or it is measured using biometry. The AL is the distance between the anterior surface of the cornea and the fovea as measured by A-scan ultrasonography or optical coherence reflectometry. For every IOL, an “<span class="italic">A</span>&#160;constant,” a theoretical value relating the lens power to AL and keratometry, is specified by the manufacturer. This constant is not expressed in units, and it is specific to the design of the IOL and its intended location and orientation within the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intraoperative aberrometry may be used to directly determine the IOL power without using measurements of corneal power and AL. Therefore, it has benefits in measuring eyes that have undergone corneal refractive surgery.</p>

			<p class="h2">IOL Calculation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prior to surgery, the ophthalmologist needs to determine the power of the IOL that should be implanted to achieve the desired refractive result. The earliest formulas (eg, Binkhorst, Colenbrander, Fyodorov) were theoretical. Newer formulas incorporate regression analyses based on large numbers of postoperative results. Popular third-&#173;generation formulas include Hoffer&#160;Q, Holladay&#160;1, Haigis L, and SRK/T. The dependability of the calculations often varies among subgroups of patients. For example, the Hoffer&#160;Q formula has been shown to be more reliable for eyes with a short AL, while the SRK/T formula has shown more reliability in long eyes. Fourth-&#173;generation formulas (Holladay&#160;2, Preussner, Barrett, and Olsen) utilize additional measurements to refine refractive results. IOL formulas in this latest generation are also more complex. For example, they incorporate the concept that the postoperative anterior chamber depth is not identical to preoperative measurements but varies with factors such as corneal curvature and IOL position. In addition, some formulas allow the ophthalmologist to adjust IOL calculations based on personal experience with a particular lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Despite ophthalmologists’ intense dedication to determining the best IOL calculation formulas, several large series have shown that approximately 25% of postoperative results miss the refractive target by more than 0.50&#160;D. And as previously discussed, IOL calculation in eyes that have undergone refractive surgery is especially problematic, as the alteration in anterior corneal curvature yields incorrect results if traditional determination of corneal power is used. Acknowledging that no single formula is perfect, many surgeons use multiple IOL calculations to hone in on the best choice. The American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS) hosts a website (http://iolcalc.org/) that allows surgeons to run several calculations simultaneously.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">IOL calculation following refractive surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Calculating the IOL power for eyes that have undergone refractive surgery presents problems for both patients and surgeons. These patients were initially motivated to have refractive surgery because they did not want to be dependent on glasses. They may have higher expectations regarding postoperative refractive results. However, determining the central keratometric power, a key element in lens power calculation, is complicated because of the corneal change that occurred as a result of the original refractive procedure. For example, the refractive outcomes of cataract surgery patients who have previously undergone RK have historically been fraught with undercorrections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Manual keratometers and corneal topography units (videokeratography) do not measure corneal power directly but rather calculate the curvature of the anterior cornea. Following corneal refractive surgery, the cornea becomes aspheric. This asphericity invalidates the anterior corneal curvature measurements obtained by either type of instrument.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, although RK did not alter the relative positions of the anterior and posterior corneal surfaces, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) do. For these reasons, different techniques must be employed to accurately estimate the anterior corneal surface curvature following these types of refractive surgery. Newer corneal topography systems that measure both anterior and posterior corneal curvatures can improve the accuracy of IOL power calculation. Because intraoperative aberrometry relies not on keratometric power but rather on the total refractive error of the eye, it is a good option for determining IOL power in post-&#173;LASIK eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients who have undergone previous corneal refractive surgery should be informed of potential problems with IOL selection. The surgeon should mention that refractive surprise due to overcorrection or undercorrection is a possibility and may require refractive correction with glasses, contact lenses, refractive surgery, or IOL exchange. Documenting this discussion is extremely important.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A variety of methods have been developed to better estimate the central corneal power after refractive surgery. As each method has advantages and disadvantages, the ophthalmic surgeon should use more than one method to calculate the corneal power. Selecting the highest IOL power of a tightly clustered group may avoid undercorrection. The ASCRS website offers a calculator for selecting IOL power for eyes that have previously undergone refractive surgery (http://iol.ascrs.org).

			<p class="h2">Preventing Errors in IOL Calculation, Selection, and Insertion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The A-scan transducer should be calibrated before use each day. Several scans should be done on each patient, and the measurements should cluster around a value, with a variance no greater than 0.2&#160;mm. Both eyes should be checked, especially if the first eye measures longer or shorter than anticipated. The difference between the eyes should be no greater than 0.3&#160;mm, unless there is a refractive or other anatomical explanation. The surgeon should make sure that the patient name and K-readings, as well as AL and white-to-white measurements, are appropriately documented. The lens power and the manufacturer’s model number should also be specified. In addition, lenses and powers for placement in the capsular bag, sulcus, or anterior chamber angle should be selected and carefully identified.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All this information should be accessible to the surgeon in the operating room, and the lenses should be located and set aside preoperatively. The surgeon should check the IOL calculations to verify that the lenses are the correct ones. In the operating room, a “time-out” should be performed with the entire surgical team before the procedure begins to confirm the patient’s identity, the operative eye, the procedure, and the IOL to be implanted.</p>
			<p class="h2">Improving Outcomes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cataract surgeon should track his or her refractive outcomes, asking questions such as the following: Are there overcorrections or undercorrections, and do they occur more often with longer eyes or shorter eyes or roughly as frequently in both? Does the incision routinely induce cylinder? Are toric lenses correcting as calculated? If limbal relaxing incisions have been used intraoperatively for the correction of astigmatism, have they been effective? Commercially available programs may be useful for tracking outcomes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the surgeon has analyzed these factors, he or she may make adjustments to improve refractive outcomes, such as including a “surgeon factor” (a modification of the parameters used that reflects the surgeon’s experience) in lens power calculation, changing the calculation software, or using immersion or optical biometry. Improving outcomes is important for increasing not only patient satisfaction but also surgeon confidence.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-12">Patient Preparation and Informed Consent</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top12">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When planning cataract surgery, the surgeon must evaluate the patient’s ability to adhere to the postoperative care regimen. The surgeon should inform the patient (and caregivers, if appropriate) of the importance of using prescribed medication, maintaining proper ocular hygiene, and keeping required appointments. It is helpful to provide written instructions, along with appropriate illustrations or video presentations, and include a family member or friend in preoperative discussions in order to reinforce the patient’s memory. The patient should understand that there are activity restrictions during the immediate postoperative period, although the advent of small-&#173;incision surgery has significantly minimized these limitations. The surgeon should also assess the patient’s ability to function with only the fellow eye in the event that vision rehabilitation of the surgical eye is prolonged.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgeon must obtain informed consent preoperatively. Before deciding to proceed with cataract surgery, the patient should have a clear understanding of the indications for surgery, the risks and benefits, the alternatives to surgery, the surgical technique, and IOL options. The surgeon should identify any risk factors for decreased visual outcome. In addition, the surgeon and patient should discuss the anticipated postoperative refractive status, the limitations of pseudophakic correction, and the proposed date for providing the final optical correction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any costs associated with the surgery (eg, those related to medications or the use of premium IOL implants) should also be clearly outlined preoperatively. In addition, if comanagement with an optometrist or another ophthalmologist is planned, the patient must be explicitly notified and must give consent in writing.</p>
