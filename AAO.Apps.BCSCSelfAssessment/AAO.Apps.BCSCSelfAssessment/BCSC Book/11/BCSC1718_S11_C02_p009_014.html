			<p class="h1">Normal Crystalline Lens</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The crystalline lens is a transparent, biconvex structure located posterior to the iris and anterior to the vitreous body (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-1</span>). The lens is suspended in position by delicate yet strong fibers (zonular fibers, sometimes referred to as the <span class="italic">zonules of Zinn</span>) that support and attach it to the ciliary body. Components of the lens are the capsule, epithelium, cortex, and nucleus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The anterior and posterior poles of the lens are joined by an imaginary line called the <span class="italic">optic axis,</span> which passes through them. Hypothetical lines on the lens surface passing from one pole to the other are referred to as <span class="italic">meridians.</span> The <span class="italic">equator</span> of the lens is its greatest circumference.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The functions of the lens are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-1">to maintain its own clarity</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">to refract light</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-2">to provide accommodation, in conjunction with the zonule and ciliary body</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Lacking a blood supply and innervation after fetal development, the lens depends entirely on the aqueous humor to meet its metabolic requirements and to remove its wastes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The lens is able to refract light because its index of refraction—normally about <br />1.4 centrally and 1.36 peripherally—is different from that of the aqueous and vitreous surrounding it. In its nonaccommodative state, the lens contributes approximately 20.00&#160;diopters&#160;(D) of the approximately 60.00&#160;D of convergent refractive power of the average human eye; the air–cornea interface provides the rest, or 40.00–45.00&#160;D.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The lens continues to grow throughout life. At birth, it measures about 6.4&#160;mm equatorially and 3.5&#160;mm anteroposteriorly and weighs approximately 90&#160;mg. The adult lens typically measures 9–10&#160;mm equatorially and about 5&#160;mm anteroposteriorly and weighs approximately 255&#160;mg. With age, the relative thickness of the cortex increases; the lens also adopts an increasingly curved shape so that older lenses have more refractive power. However, the index of refraction decreases with age, probably as a result of the increasing presence of insoluble protein particles. Thus, the eye may become either more hyperopic or more myopic with age, depending on the balance of these opposing changes.</p>
			<p class="h2">Capsule</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens capsule is an elastic, transparent basement membrane that is composed of type&#160;IV collagen and other matrix proteins and laid down by the epithelial cells. The capsule contains the lens substance and is capable of molding it during accommodative changes. The outer layer of the lens capsule, the <span class="italic">zonular lamella,</span> also serves as the point of attachment for the zonular fibers. The lens capsule is thickest in the anterior and posterior preequatorial zones and thinnest at the central posterior pole, where it may measure only 2–4&#160;µm (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-3</span>). The anterior lens capsule is considerably thicker than the posterior capsule at birth, and its thickness increases throughout life.</p>
			<p class="h2">Zonular Fibers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lens is supported by the system of fibers (the zonule) that originate from the basal lamina of the nonpigmented epithelium of the pars plana and pars plicata of the ciliary body. The zonular fibers consist of microfibrils composed of elastic tissue, and they insert at discrete points on the lens capsule 1.5&#160;mm anterior to the equator and 1.25&#160;mm posterior to the equator. With age, the equatorial zonular fibers regress, leaving separate anterior and posterior layers that appear in a triangular shape on cross section of the zonular ring. The fibers are 5–30&#160;µm in diameter; light microscopy shows them to be eosinophilic structures that have a positive periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reaction. Ultrastructurally, the strands, or microfibrils, composing the fibers are 8–10&#160;nm in diameter, with 12–14&#160;nm of banding.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lens Epithelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Immediately posterior to the anterior lens capsule is a single layer of epithelial cells. These cells are metabolically active and carry out all normal cell activities, including biosynthesis of DNA, RNA, protein, and lipid. They also generate adenosine triphosphate to meet the energy demands of the lens. The epithelial cells are mitotic, with the greatest activity of premitotic (replicative, or S&#160;phase) DNA synthesis occurring in a ring around the anterior lens known as the <span class="italic">germinative zone.</span> The newly formed cells migrate toward the equator, where they differentiate into fibers. As the epithelial cells migrate toward the bow region of the lens, they begin the process of terminal differentiation into lens fibers (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Perhaps the most dramatic morphologic change occurs when the epithelial cells elongate to form lens fiber cells. This change is associated with a tremendous increase in the mass of cellular proteins in the fiber cell membrane. At the same time, the cells lose organelles, including nuclei, mitochondria, and ribosomes. The loss of these organelles is optically advantageous, because light passing through the lens is no longer absorbed or scattered by these structures. However, because these new lens fiber cells lack the metabolic functions previously carried out by the organelles, they are now dependent on glycolysis for energy production (see Chapter&#160;3).</p>
			<p class="h2">Nucleus and Cortex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">No cells are lost from the lens; as new fibers are laid down, they crowd and compact the previously formed fibers, with the older layers located toward the center. The oldest layers, the <span class="italic">embryonic and fetal lens nuclei,</span> were produced in embryonic life and persist in the center of the lens (see Chapter&#160;4, Fig&#160;4-1). The outermost fibers are the most recently formed and make up the cortex of the lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Lens sutures</span> (see Chapter&#160;4, Fig&#160;4-1) are formed by the interdigitation of the anterior and posterior tips of the spindle-&#173;shaped fibers. Multiple optical zones, as well as Y-shaped sutures located within the lens nucleus, are visible by slit-lamp biomicroscopy. (See Chapter&#160;4 for further discussion of the embryonic nucleus and lens sutures.) These zones of demarcation occur because strata of epithelial cells with differing optical densities are laid down throughout life. There is no morphologic distinction between the cortex and the nucleus; rather, the transition between these regions is gradual. Although some surgical texts and this volume make distinctions between the nucleus, epinucleus, endonucleus, and cortex, these terms relate only to potential differences in the behavior and appearance of the material during surgical procedures.</p>
