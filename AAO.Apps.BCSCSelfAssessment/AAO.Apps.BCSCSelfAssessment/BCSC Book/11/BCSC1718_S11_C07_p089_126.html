			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Historical Overview of Cataract Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ancient and medieval treatment of cataract included <span class="italic">couching,</span> a technique with a colorful history dating to approximately the fifth century <span class="CharOverride-1">bc</span>. This procedure, which was used throughout the Roman Empire, Europe, India, and sub-&#173;Saharan Africa, was performed on mature cataracts. With the patient in a seated position, the surgeon inserted a needle or knife posterior to the corneoscleral junction and then pushed the lens inferiorly (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">By the 17th century, a better understanding of anatomy led to a fundamental improvement in technique. Jacques Daviel (1696–1762) is credited with propelling cataract surgery toward the modern era by introducing a method to extract the cataract rather than simply displace it. His method involved creating an incision through the inferior cornea, enlarging the wound with scissors, incising the lens capsule, expressing the nucleus, and removing the cortex by curettage (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-2</span>). This <span class="italic">extracapsular cataract extraction,</span> or <span class="italic">ECCE,</span> became the new standard of care. Subsequently, Albrecht von Graefe (1828–1870) advanced this technique by developing a corneal knife that created a cleaner incision and led to improved wound healing. The development of fine suture material, the invention of the binocular operating microscope, and the introduction of modern sterilization techniques reduced the incidence of surgical complications, and variations on manual ECCE continue to be employed to this day. See the appendix for a more detailed discussion of ECCE.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Removal of a cataractous lens via <span class="italic">intracapsular cataract extraction,</span> or <span class="italic">ICCE,</span> was first performed in 1753 by Samuel Sharp. This procedure involved removing the lens with the capsule intact through a limbal incision by using various means to break or dissolve the zonular fibers, which attach the lens to the ciliary body. See the appendix for further discussion of the modern ICCE procedure, including a figure showing ICCE performed with a cryoprobe to remove the encapsulated lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The invention of phacoemulsification by Charles Kelman in 1967 marked the beginning of the modern era of cataract surgery. Though initially met with strong resistance, phacoemulsification gained popularity by the 1990s. In this procedure, an ultrasonically driven tip is used to emulsify the lens nucleus and remove the fragments with an automated aspiration system. This paradigm shift allowed cataract surgery to be performed via relatively small corneal incisions, resulting in a lower incidence of wound-&#173;related and vitreous-&#173;related complications and more rapid rehabilitation of vision. This advance also coincided with the invention of ophthalmic viscosurgical devices, the evolution of intraocular lens design, and a change to performance of cataract surgery on an outpatient basis.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Anesthesia for Cataract Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Consideration of the options for anesthesia is an important part of preoperative planning. A general review of the advantages and risks of the different types of anesthesia should accompany the informed consent process. A discussion of what the patient will experience in the operating room increases the likelihood of comfort and cooperation on the day of surgery. (See also BCSC Section&#160;1, <span class="italic">Update on General Medicine,</span> for a discussion of perioperative management in ocular surgery.)</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Retrobulbar anesthesia</span> for cataract surgery provides excellent ocular akinesia and anesthesia. The modern technique of retrobulbar injection (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-3</span>), first described in 1945 by Walter Atkinson, involves administration of lidocaine into the muscle cone via a 25-gauge, 1.5-inch (38-mm) blunt retrobulbar needle. Complications of retrobulbar anesthesia are uncommon but include retrobulbar hemorrhage; globe penetration; optic nerve trauma; extraocular muscle toxicity; inadvertent intravenous injection associated with cardiac arrhythmia; and inadvertent intradural injection with associated seizures, respiratory arrest, and brainstem anesthesia.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Peribulbar anesthesia</span> theoretically eliminates the risk of complications such as optic nerve injury and intradural injection. However, it is slightly less effective than the retrobulbar method for providing akinesia and anesthesia. In this technique, a shorter (1-inch) 25- or 27-gauge needle is used to introduce anesthetic solution external to the muscle cone, underneath the Tenon capsule.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Sub-Tenon</span> infusion of lidocaine may be used for supplemental anesthesia during surgery. A small, posterior incision is made through anesthetized conjunctiva and the Tenon capsule, and a small cannula is used to administer the anesthetic (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Topical anesthesia</span> has been increasingly utilized as surgical techniques have advanced. The use of topical anesthesia eliminates the risk of ocular perforation, extraocular muscle injury, and central nervous system depression. Visual recovery is accelerated, and patients are often able to leave the operating room without being patched. Topical anesthesia is administered via proparacaine or tetracaine drops, cellulose pledgets soaked in anesthetic, or lidocaine jelly. These agents may be supplemented with intravenous sedation and/or intracameral preservative-&#173;free lidocaine. Only nonpreserved 1% or 2% lidocaine should be used for anterior chamber instillation, because of the toxic effect of some preservative agents on intraocular structures. Disadvantages of topical anesthesia include blepharospasm, lack of akinesia, and potential patient discomfort, which can interfere with the surgeon’s ability to perform delicate maneuvers. Topical anesthesia should be reserved for the cooperative cataract patient who, with a dilated pupil, can tolerate the microscope light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">facial nerve block,</span> common in the era of large-&#173;incision ICCE and ECCE, is not generally necessary with small-&#173;incision surgery. However, patients with essential or reactive blepharospasm may benefit from a facial nerve block to control squeezing during surgery. Types of facial nerve blocks include the O’Brien block, directed proximally and peripherally at the nerve trunk; the van Lint block, directed proximally and peripherally at the terminal branches; and the Atkinson block, directed between these two regions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">General anesthesia,</span> with clearance from the patient’s primary care physician or an anesthesiologist, is appropriate to consider for pediatric patients and for patients who have any condition that would prevent their cooperation and ability to lie flat during surgery, including dementia, head tremor, deafness, language barrier, musculoskeletal disorder, restless legs syndrome, or claustrophobia.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Antimicrobial Prophylaxis</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endophthalmitis remains one of the most serious complications of cataract surgery (see Chapter&#160;8). Therefore, a major objective of preoperative preparation and intraoperative management of the patient is to reduce the introduction of pathogenic organisms into the anterior chamber.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Before Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before the day of surgery, the surgeon should identify and reduce infectious risk factors as much as possible through preoperative treatment of coexisting eyelid disorders such as conjunctivitis, blepharitis, hordeolum, and chalazion. Systemic infections should also be identified and treated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cataract surgery is not considered to be an invasive procedure that induces transient bacteremia; thus, systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is not required. If questions arise about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is advisable in the perioperative period, the surgeon should consult with the physicians involved in the patient’s systemic care.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although no studies have convincingly demonstrated the efficacy of topical antibiotics in reducing the risk of endophthalmitis in routine cataract surgery, there is some evidence supporting an association between the use of preoperative topical antibiotics and a reduction in ocular surface bacterial counts, as well as a lower incidence of positive aqueous cultures after surgery. Many cataract surgeons prescribe preoperative topical antibiotics.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For patients with a history of herpetic eye disease, the surgeon should consider prescribing prophylactic antiviral medications. This topic is further discussed in Chapter&#160;9.</p>
			<p class="reference-first ParaOverride-6">Sykakis E, Karim R, Parmar DN. Management of patients with herpes simplex virus eye disease having cataract surgery in the United Kingdom. <span class="italic">J&#160;Cataract Refract Surg.</span> 2013;<br />39(8):1254–1259.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">In Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the operating room, sterilization of the fornix is important. A 5% povidone-&#173;iodine solution (not scrub or soap) placed in the conjunctival fornix prior to surgery has been associated with a reduction in bacterial colony counts in cultures from the ocular surface at the time of surgery and a decreased risk of culture-&#173;proven endophthalmitis. In addition, preparation of the skin around the eye with a 10% povidone-&#173;iodine solution can reduce bacterial counts on the eyelid margins. Because eyelid margins may harbor pathogens, care should be taken to drape the eyelashes out of the operative field (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-6</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is important not only to limit the number of times that instruments are introduced into the eye but also to check for signs of lint, cilia, and other debris on the tips of all instruments inserted. Intraoperative manipulation should be reduced as well. Meticulous wound closure is imperative. Despite surgeons’ best efforts, however, 7%–35% of cataract surgeries result in bacterial inoculation of the anterior chamber. The low incidence of endophthalmitis is a testament to the ability of the anterior chamber to clear itself of a potentially pathologic inoculum. The surgeon should also be aware that the risk of endophthalmitis increases with a torn posterior lens capsule, vitreous loss, and prolonged surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some surgeons add antibiotics to the irrigating solution or inject them into the anterior chamber at the conclusion of the operation. The Endophthalmitis Study Group reported a significant reduction in endophthalmitis with the use of intracameral cefuroxime. The use of intracameral cefuroxime has not been universally adopted, however, because of the lack of commercial antibiotic preparations for intracameral use.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Whether the risk of endophthalmitis is increased after cataract surgery performed using a sutureless clear corneal wound is controversial. By tracking the flow of fluorescein into the anterior chamber, some have suggested that inflow of bacteria from the ocular surface may be possible via a sutureless incision. For this reason, hydrating the corneal stroma to reapproximate the anterior and posterior aspects of the wound may reduce the risk of wound separation. Any possibility of leakage should be addressed with wound closure by suture or tissue adhesive.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-10">Ophthalmic Viscosurgical Devices</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs), also referred to as <span class="italic">viscoelastic agents,</span> have been employed in anterior segment surgery since 1979. They play an important role in maintaining the anterior chamber and protecting the corneal endothelium during surgery, and their use has had a profound influence on the evolution of extracapsular and phacoemulsification surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">OVDs contain one or more of the following substances in varying concentrations: sodium hyaluronate, chondroitin sulfate, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. <span class="italic">Sodium hy</span><span class="italic">aluronate</span> is a biopolymer that occurs in many connective tissues throughout the body, such as synovial (joint) fluid and vitreous. It was originally isolated from human umbilical cord and rooster combs. Sodium hyaluronate has a half-life of approximately 1&#160;day in aqueous and 3&#160;days in vitreous. <span class="italic">Chondroitin sulfate</span> is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan, which is an important component of cartilage. <span class="italic">Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)</span> does not occur naturally in animal tissues, but cellulose is widely distributed in plant fibers such as cotton and wood. The commercial product is a cellulose polymer modified by the addition of hydroxypropyl and methyl groups to increase the hydrophilic property of the material. <span class="italic">Methylcellulose</span> is a nonphysiologic compound that does not appear to be metabolized intraocularly. It is eventually eliminated in the aqueous but can easily be irrigated from the eye.</p>
			<p class="h2">Physical Properties</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The physical properties of OVDs are not necessarily due to the specific biopolymer composition; rather, they are the result of chain length and molecular interactions both within chains and between chains and ocular tissue. There are 4&#160;general physical properties:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-6">1.&#9;<span class="italic">Viscosity</span> describes resistance to flow and can be thought of as the “thickness” or “thinness” of a fluid. It is determined primarily by molecular weight and concentration, so that substances with high molecular weight and high concentration have the highest viscosity. The higher the viscosity, the better the OVD is at displacing tissue and staying in place.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;<span class="italic">Elasticity</span> refers to the ability of a material to return to its original shape after being stressed. It describes the OVD’s ability to re-form after an external force is applied to the anterior chamber and then removed. A highly elastic substance is excellent for maintaining space.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;<span class="italic">Pseudoplasticity</span> refers to the ease with which a material can change from being highly viscous at rest to being watery at increasing rates of shear stress. This property is found in certain everyday substances such as toothpaste; when squeezed out of a tube, toothpaste flows easily, but it retains its shape when it is at rest on the toothbrush. In clinical terms, at zero&#160;shear force an OVD is a lubricant and coats tissues well, but when forced through a small-gauge cannula it functions like a liquid.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-11">4.&#9;<span class="italic">Surface tension</span> describes how the surface of a fluid tends to stick to another surface. This property is also referred to as coatability, which is inversely proportional to surface tension. Thus, an OVD with low surface tension is better at coating tissue but is harder to remove from the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Given the different combinations of all of these properties, OVDs can be classified into 2&#160;general categories:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-6">1.&#9;<span class="italic">Cohesive OVDs</span> are long-chain, high-molecular-weight, high-viscosity substances. These agents maintain space well at no or low shear rates, whereas at high shear rates they are easily displaced. Cohesive OVDs are easier to remove from the eye because they stick together and are aspirated as long pieces (similar to spaghetti). However, they have minimal coating ability and therefore afford less tissue protection during surgery.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-11">2.&#9;<span class="italic">Dispersive OVDs</span> are short-chain, low-&#173;molecular-weight, low-&#173;viscosity substances with low surface tension. These agents provide excellent coating and protection at high shear rates; however, they are more difficult to remove from the eye because they do not stick together and are aspirated in short fragments (similar to macaroni). They are more likely to be retained in the eye after cataract surgery, increasing the likelihood of angle obstruction with reduced outflow and subsequent IOP elevation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cohesive agents include Healon, Healon GV (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA); Amvisc, Amvisc Plus (Bausch&#160;+ Lomb, Rochester, NY); and Provisc (Alcon, Ft Worth, TX). <br />Dispersive agents include OcuCoat (Bausch&#160;+ Lomb), Viscoat (Alcon), and Healon Endocoat (Abbott Medical Optics). Discovisc (Alcon) combines qualities of dispersive and cohesive agents.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some additional OVDs, such as the viscoadaptive agent Healon5 (Abbott Medical Optics), may need separate classification. Healon5 is a long, fragile chain with high molecular weight that changes its behavior at different flow rates. The lower the flow rate, the more viscous and cohesive the OVD is, and the higher the flow rate, the more the chains fracture. As a result, this OVD acts as a pseudodispersive agent. However, it must be carefully removed at the end of surgery because it can cause extremely elevated IOP if left in the eye.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Uses of Ophthalmic Viscosurgical Devices</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">space maintenance ability</span> of OVDs keeps the anterior chamber formed despite the presence of one or more corneal incisions. With expansion of the chamber, manipulations can be made away from the corneal endothelium and posterior lens capsule. A cohesive OVD can be used to enlarge a marginally dilated pupil (viscomydriasis). It can also be used to keep the plane of the anterior capsule flat to assist a controlled continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis. Lens implantation is less traumatic to the zonular fibers and the posterior capsule when the capsular bag is inflated with an OVD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">coatability</span> of OVDs can be used to protect the corneal endothelium from phaco energy, particularly in dense cataracts or during long operations. The surgeon must take care to remove dispersive OVDs completely to reduce the risk of an ocular hypertensive period caused by angle outflow obstruction. In the presence of an open posterior lens capsule, a dispersive OVD can be injected over the tear to provide a vitreous tamponade and prevent prolapse of vitreous anteriorly.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">optical clarity</span> of OVDs has prompted some surgeons to use a layer of OVD on the surface of the cornea. When slightly moistened with balanced salt solution, the agent coats the epithelium. This maneuver prevents drying and eliminates the need to irrigate the corneal surface. It also provides a slightly magnified view of anterior segment structures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The choice of OVD varies depending on the clinical scenario. A survey showed that 97% of surgeons vary their choice of OVD in complicated cases. For example, in pediatric cataracts or cases with a low endothelial cell count, shallow anterior chamber, or intraoperative floppy iris syndrome, the choice of OVD can play a critical role in management.</p>

			<p class="h1">Phacoemulsification: Instrumentation, Terminology, and Key Concepts</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Instrumentation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">There are several types of phaco machines, but their major components are essentially the same. These include the handpiece, foot pedal, irrigation system, and vacuum pump.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Phacoemulsification makes use of ultrasound technology, as well as vacuum (defined in the section Fluidics and Phacodynamics). The phaco handpiece (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-7</span>) has been likened to a combination of a jackhammer, vacuum, and garden hose. The surgeon uses the handpiece to simultaneously emulsify and aspirate the crystalline lens while keeping the tip cool and maintaining anterior chamber depth. The mechanical energy of phacoemulsification is produced by a to-and-fro oscillation generated by <span class="italic">piezoelectric crystals</span> in the phaco handpiece. The amplitude of the movement, or <span class="italic">stroke length,</span> is variable and increases when the power is raised. As the phaco tip moves forward, compression of gas atoms in solution occurs; as the tip moves backward, expansion of gas atoms occurs, and bubbles of gas form (cavitation; see the section Ultrasonic Technology Terminology). The bubbles are subject to the same compression and expansion. When the bubbles implode, they release heat and shock waves, which contribute to activity that disassembles the nucleus at the phaco tip. Nonaxial vibrations generated by a torsional or elliptical motion of the tip can augment the primary oscillation and cause the mechanical breakdown of nuclear material. These mechanisms are specific to the type of phaco machine used.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The phaco foot pedal is an important component for mastering the phacoemulsification technique. All current phaco machines have foot-&#173;pedal controls with at least 3&#160;positions. Position&#160;1 produces irrigation, whereas position&#160;2 engages the aspiration mode at a constant or variable rate. Position&#160;3 adds phaco power at a variable or fixed level. When fixed, the power level may be set from 0% to 100%, and the chosen power level is delivered immediately when the foot pedal is depressed to position&#160;3. With linear ultrasound, the surgeon controls the amount of phaco power delivered by varying the depth of depression of the foot pedal while it is in position&#160;3.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Ultrasonic Technology Terminology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following terms are commonly used in reference to ultrasonic technology.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-13"><span class="h4-head">Cavitation</span> The formation of gas bubbles arising from the aqueous in response to pressure changes at the tip of the phaco needle; these bubbles expand and contract. Implosion of the bubbles causes localized intense heat and pressure liberation at the tip, resulting in emulsification of lens material. Continuous cavitation, produced by continuous ultrasound delivery, is less efficient than the transient cavitation of intermittent ultrasound delivery.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-13"><span class="h4-head">Chatter</span> Occurs when the ultrasonic stroke overcomes the vacuum, or “holding power.” This process causes the nuclear fragments to be repelled by the ultrasonic tip until the vacuum reaches levels sufficient to neutralize the ultrasonic tip’s repulsive energy and once again attract the material. This back-and-forth movement of lens material from the tip inhibits followability (see the section Fluidics and Phacodynamics Terminology, later in this chapter). A reduction in phaco power can diminish chatter by decreasing the stroke length of the tip excursion, thereby reducing forces that push the fragment away from the tip.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-13"><span class="h4-head">Energy</span> Power multiplied by time. Surgeons may reduce the amount of energy released inside the eye by decreasing either the phaco power or the length of time that the phaco power is on. Thus, energy and power are not the same.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-13"><span class="h4-head">Frequency</span> The speed at which the phaco needle moves back and forth. The term <span class="italic">ultrasonic</span> is used for frequencies above the range of human audibility, or greater than 20,000&#160;Hz. The frequency of phaco handpieces is between 27,000&#160;Hz and 60,000&#160;Hz.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Piezoelectric crystal</span> A type of transducer used in ultrasonic handpieces that transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy. Linear motion is generated when a tuned, highly refined crystal is deformed by the electrical energy supplied by the console.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h4-head">Power</span> The ability of the phaco needle to vibrate and cavitate the adjacent lens material. Power is noted as a linear percentage of the maximum stroke length of the phaco needle. Phaco power is produced when the foot pedal is depressed to position&#160;3.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h4-head">Stroke</span> The linear distance that the tip traverses to produce an impact on lens material. In phacoemulsification, the stroke length varies among devices, from 0.05 to 0.10&#160;mm (or 0.002 to 0.004&#160;inches).</p>
			<p class="h2">Key Concepts and Advances in Phaco Power Delivery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The delivery of phaco power can have both favorable and unfavorable consequences. Certainly, cavitation, shock waves, shear forces, and heat buildup at the tip may all facilitate disassembly of the lens nucleus. However, more power is not necessarily better; the longitudinal stroke of the phaco tip tends to push nuclear fragments away even as the aspiration attracts them, resulting in <span class="italic">chatter.</span> In addition, heat buildup from the delivery of phaco power may cause wound burns and damage to the corneal endothelium. The goal is to achieve the correct balance of safety and phaco power. Many parameters can be adjusted to deliver phaco power more efficiently and safely. The size and angle of the phaco tip can be altered to increase cutting efficiency. Modes of intermittent rather than continuous phacoemulsification, such as pulse and burst, can also be used. Various mechanical strategies, including torsional and elliptical movement of the phaco tip, may also minimize heat generation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Phaco tip</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phaco tips vary according to the angle of the tip and the size of the lumen. Phaco tips are available with bevels of 0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, and 60° (see Fig&#160;7-7). End configurations can be round, ellipsoid, bent, or flared. In general, the surgeon chooses the bevel angle of the phaco tip according to personal preference. A tip with a steeper bevel has an oval port with a larger surface area, which can generate more holding force (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-8</span>) and greater cutting efficiency. The disadvantage of steeper bevels is that the larger opening may be more difficult to occlude to achieve full vacuum.</p>
			<p class="h3">Pulse and burst</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">To reduce the total energy delivered to the corneal endothelium, the surgeon may use modes of intermittent rather than continuous phacoemulsification.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Pulsed phacoemulsification</span> involves setting the number of pulses per second while in position&#160;3. The term <span class="italic">pulse</span> describes an interval of phaco power turned on alternating with an interval during which phaco power is off. The amount of power delivered depends on the foot-&#173;pedal excursion in position&#160;3. The delivery of phaco power for only a portion of the cycle reduces repulsion of material by the vibrating tip and improves followability. Duty cycle refers to the ratio of on:off pulses. If the time of “power on” equals the time of “power off,” the duty cycle is 50%.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Burst-mode phacoemulsification</span> involves delivery of preset power (0%–100%) in single bursts that are separated by decreasing intervals as the foot pedal is depressed through position&#160;3. At the end of the position&#160;3 excursion, the power is no longer delivered in bursts but is continuous. Burst mode allows the tip of the phaco needle to be buried into the lens, an essential step for chopping techniques.</p>
			<p class="h3">Torsional and elliptical phacoemulsification</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Advances in phacoemulsification technology have resulted in reductions in the total amount of phaco energy delivered to achieve emulsification. For example, in torsional phacoemulsification (Ozil Torsional, Alcon, Ft&#160;Worth, TX), the piezoelectric crystals of the phaco handpiece produce an oscillatory (torsional) movement, which is amplified by use of a bent Kelman phaco tip. The greater side-to-side movement at the tip allows for greater shearing forces to assist in nucleus disassembly. Another system utilizes a combination of transverse and longitudinal modalities (Ellips FX Technology, Abbott Medical Optics, Abbott Park, IL); the resulting elliptical cutting pattern enhances nucleus emulsification.</p>
			<p class="h2">Irrigation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The fluid dynamics of phacoemulsification require constant irrigation through the sleeve around the ultrasound tip with some egress of fluid through the incisions. Coaxial irrigation with balanced salt solution cools the phaco tip, preventing heat buildup and consequent damage to adjacent tissue.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another important purpose of irrigation is maintenance of the anterior chamber during surgery. The surgeon generally adjusts intraocular pressure and anterior chamber depth by changing the height of the irrigation bottle, with gravity providing the force necessary to increase the level of irrigation. In newer phaco machines, a collapsible saline bag is compressed by pressure plates. Sensors on the plates provide continuous feedback, allowing for active control of fluidics and resulting in a more stable anterior chamber.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some surgeons put additives in the irrigation bottle to maintain pupillary dilation. Others add antibiotics to the bottle as prophylaxis against endophthalmitis (see the section Antimicrobial Prophylaxis, earlier in this chapter).</p>

			<p class="h2">Fluidics and Phacodynamics Terminology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following terms are commonly used in the discussion of fluidics and phacodynamics.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Aspiration</span> The withdrawal of fluid and lens material from the eye; produced by depressing the foot pedal to position&#160;2 and continuing in position&#160;3.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Flow rate</span> The flow of fluid through the tubing, measured in milliliters per minute (mL/min). Fluid flow occurs when the phaco tip is not occluded, and the rate helps determine how quickly fragments flow to the phaco tip.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Followability</span> The ability of a fluidic system to attract and hold nuclear or cortical material onto the tip of an ultrasonic or irrigation/aspiration (I/A) handpiece until vacuum forces achieve evacuation.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Occlusion</span> An obstruction of the aspiration port or aspiration tubing. When lens material occludes the tip of the phaco needle, vacuum builds until it reaches the machine’s preset value or until the material is evacuated.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Rise time</span> The rate at which vacuum builds once the aspiration port has been occluded. Rise time is related to the aspiration flow rate, which is related to the speed of the aspiration pump (see the section Aspiration Pumps). The faster the aspiration flow rate (or pump speed), the faster is the rise time.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Surge</span> A phenomenon that occurs when a vacuum has built up because of an occlusion and the occlusion is suddenly broken, causing the fluid in the higher-&#173;pressure (positive) anterior chamber to rush into the lower-&#173;pressure (negative) phaco tip. If the negative surge exceeds the inflow capability of the irrigation line, fluctuations in anterior chamber depth may occur, and the iris or posterior capsule may be drawn into the tip. Changes made in phaco equipment in order to limit surge include higher irrigation, lower vacuum, low-&#173;compliance tubing of smaller diameter, a smaller tip, coiled aspiration tubing, and occlusion-&#173;mode software. In addition, improvements in software allow automatic modification of aspiration and flow.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Vacuum</span> A parameter measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or inches of water and defined as the magnitude of negative pressure created in the tubing. Vacuum is generated when the phaco tip is occluded and measures how well particulate material will be held onto it.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Aspiration Pumps</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The aspiration system of the phaco machine is a critical element in the performance of various phaco maneuvers. An understanding of this system, therefore, can greatly affect the efficiency of the surgeon’s phaco technique. Adjusting the flow rate can help attract nuclear or cortical material onto the distal end of the handpiece. Adjusting vacuum determines how tightly particulate material that has occluded the phaco tip will be grasped. The objectives are to utilize fluidics to maximize phaco efficiency and to grasp nuclear fragments without inadvertently damaging the iris, capsule, or other intraocular tissues.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There are 3&#160;main types of aspiration pumps that are used in phaco machines: peristaltic pumps, diaphragm pumps, and Venturi pumps. A <span class="italic">peristaltic pump</span> consists of a set of rollers that move along flexible tubing, forcing fluid through the tubing and creating a relative vacuum at the aspiration port of the phaco tip (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-9</span>). The vacuum response time with this type of pump is relatively rapid; linear control is achieved as the speed of the rollers is increased. Vacuum is flow based and does not build up until the tip is occluded.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">diaphragm pump</span> consists of a flexible diaphragm overlying a fluid chamber with 1-way valves at the inlet and outlet. The diaphragm moves out, creating a relative vacuum in the chamber that closes the exit valve, causing the fluid to flow into the chamber. The diaphragm then moves in, increasing the pressure in the chamber and closing the intake valve while opening the exit valve (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-10</span>). This type of pump system produces a slower rise in vacuum. With continued occlusion of the aspiration port, however, the vacuum will continue to increase in an exponential manner.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">Venturi pump</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-11</span>) creates a vacuum based on the Venturi principle: a flow of gas or fluid across a port creates a vacuum proportional to the rate of flow of the gas. This system produces a rapid, linear rise in vacuum and enables instantaneous venting to the atmosphere, immediately stopping the flow through the port. The vacuum is not flow based and builds according to the machine setting.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, all of these pumps are effective. The vacuum rise time (the amount of time required to reach a given level of vacuum) varies among the different pump designs. The latest generation of machines employs continuous feedback sensors that measure flow and make immediate adjustments.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Eye Marking and Time-Out</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prior to surgery, a designated member of the surgical team, typically the surgeon, marks the operative eye to prevent errors in surgical site (eg, wrong eye). Standard practice includes using marking pens or stickers to identify the operative eye. Depending on the surgical drape being used, it may be beneficial to place the mark on the cheek or under the eyebrow, rather than on the forehead. In this way, the surgeon can see the identifying mark immediately before placing the surgical drape.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The “time-out” is an opportunity for the surgeon and the rest of the operating room team, including the anesthesiologist and nursing staff, to ensure that everyone is prepared for the correct surgical procedure on the correct eye, with the correct implant. Information typically reviewed during the time-out includes patient name, patient date of birth, procedure, operative eye, and the type and power of intraocular lens (IOL). Using 2&#160;patient identifiers (eg, name and date of birth) will help prevent errors in cases where 2&#160;patients share the same name. Also, verifying the IOL at this time reduces the risk of implanting an incorrect lens.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-18">Exposure of the Globe</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After the anesthesia has been administered and the eye is prepared and draped in sterile fashion (see the section Antimicrobial Prophylaxis, earlier in this chapter, and Fig&#160;7-6), the eyelids are held apart with an eyelid speculum. When selecting the speculum, the surgeon should make sure that it will accommodate the phaco handpiece and other instruments (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-12</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgeon may choose to be seated superiorly or temporally. This preference may be dictated by the prominence of the patient’s brow, the presence of a large pterygium or filtering bleb, or a history of previous ocular surgery. Another factor to consider is the axis of astigmatism, with mild flattening induced at the site of a clear corneal wound.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-18">Paracentesis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The paracentesis incision is used for multiple purposes, including insertion of a second instrument, introduction of intracameral additives, and placement of iris hooks. A small sharp blade, such as a 15° superblade or microvitreoretinal (MVR) blade, is used to create 1 or 2&#160;small paracentesis incisions placed approximately 2 or 3&#160;clock-hours away from the site where an incision will be made for the phaco handpiece. A straight entry plane is made parallel to the iris or at a slight downward angle. Alternatively, these incisions may be made by femtosecond laser. Once the paracentesis is complete, an OVD is instilled to protect intraocular structures and to give the surgeon more control during creation of the phaco incision.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Clear Corneal Incision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most phaco surgeons use a clear corneal approach for the main incision (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-13</span>). These small incisions are typically 2.4–3.2-mm wide, just large enough to accommodate the phaco handpiece and allow for insertion of the IOL. Globe stabilization is important in clear corneal incisions, especially if the procedure is performed with topical anesthesia. Fixation rings, 0.12-mm toothed forceps, or instruments supplying counterpressure can be used to stabilize the globe as the incisions are made.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Various types of corneal phaco incisions, including biplanar and multiplanar incisions, have been described. Regardless of which type of clear corneal incision is used, an important objective is to create a stable, watertight incision in order to minimize the risk of wound leak and endophthalmitis. In the multiplanar technique introduced by David Langerman, a diamond or metal knife is used to create a 0.3-mm-deep groove perpendicular to the corneal surface. Another blade is inserted into the groove, and its tip is then directed tangentially to the corneal surface, creating a tunnel through clear cornea into the anterior chamber. This multiplanar incision architecture usually results in a wound that is watertight.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another approach is the beveled, biplanar self-&#173;sealing incision, as advocated by Shimuzu and Fine. A beveled blade is flattened against the eye, and the tip is used to enter the cornea just anterior to the vascular arcade. The blade is advanced tangentially to the corneal surface until the shoulders of the blade are fully buried in the stroma. The point of the blade is then redirected posteriorly so that the point and the rest of the blade enter the anterior chamber parallel to the iris. This technique ideally creates a tunneled corneal incision that is watertight.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Beveled, trapezoidal diamond blades have been developed for creating self-&#173;sealing clear corneal incisions. Such blades can be advanced in one motion and in one plane, from clear cornea into the anterior chamber. The blade is oriented parallel to the iris, and the tip is placed at the start of the clear cornea, just anterior to the vascular arcade. The blade is tilted up and the heel down so that the blade is angled 10° from the iris plane; it is then advanced into the anterior chamber in one smooth, continuous motion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another type of incision is the “near clear” approach, in which the incision begins within the vascular arcade. Proponents of this approach cite better wound closure and a reduced incidence of induced astigmatism. However, slight bleeding may take place during surgery; conjunctival ballooning may occur; and a subconjunctival hemorrhage may be present postoperatively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Regardless of which type of clear corneal incision is used, the length of the wound should permit optimal visualization and instrument manipulation during phacoemulsification. If the corneal incision is too long, the surgeon may have problems manipulating the phaco <br />tip within the anterior chamber and corneal striae may reduce visibility as the surgeon manipulates the handpiece. If the tunnel is too short, the incision may not seal postoperatively. The phaco tip may also abrade the iris, causing atrophy and possible pupil distortion.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-18">Scleral Tunnel Incision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An alternative to the clear corneal incision is a scleral tunnel incision (Fig 7-14). One advantage of this type of incision is that it creates an internal corneal lip, which may reduce the incidence of both early and late surgically induced astigmatism. Another advantage may be more-&#173;controlled conversion to ECCE, if this becomes necessary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A limited conjunctival peritomy is created over the intended incision site. The surgeon then clears the overlying Tenon capsule from the sclera and applies light bipolar cautery to achieve hemostasis. Excessive cautery should be avoided because it may cause scleral shrinkage and postoperative astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The scleral incision is usually linear, but it may be either curvilinear (smile-shaped, following the limbus, or frown-shaped, following the curve opposite the limbus) or chevron-&#173;shaped. After making the incision, the surgeon uses a blade to enter the scleral groove at a depth of half the scleral thickness, dissecting anteriorly into clear cornea just anterior to the vascular arcade, creating a partial-&#173;thickness scleral tunnel. If the scleral groove is entered too deeply, the scleral flap will be very thick, and the blade may penetrate the anterior chamber earlier than anticipated, closer to the vascular iris root. If the scleral groove is entered too superficially, the scleral flap will be very thin and prone to tears or buttonholes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To enter the anterior chamber from beneath the scleral flap, the surgeon uses a keratome sized to match the width of the phaco tip. The keratome is inserted into the corneal stroma until the tip reaches the clear cornea beyond the vascular arcade. The heel of the keratome is elevated, and the tip of the keratome is pointed posteriorly, aiming toward the center of the lens and creating a dimple in the peripheral cornea. The keratome is then slowly advanced in this posterior direction, creating an internal corneal lip as it enters the anterior chamber.</p>

			<p class="h2">Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorrhexis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After the incision has been made, the next step is to open the lens capsule. Opening the capsule with a continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC) gives the surgeon a wide range of phacoemulsification techniques from which to choose (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-15</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A CCC resists radial tears that could extend around and open the posterior capsule, setting the stage for complications. In addition, a CCC stabilizes the lens nucleus, allowing maneuvers to disassemble it within the capsular bag and thereby reducing trauma to the corneal endothelium. A CCC also transfers haptic forces circumferentially and helps stabilize and center the lens implant. A CCC sized just smaller than the IOL optic may allow for tighter contact between the posterior surface of the posterior chamber IOL (PCIOL) and the posterior capsule, possibly reducing the incidence of posterior capsule opacification.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgeon begins a CCC with a central, radial cut in the anterior capsule by using a cystotome needle or capsulorrhexis forceps with special tips for grasping and tearing. At the end of the radial cut, the needle is either pushed or pulled in the direction of the desired tear, allowing the anterior capsule to fold over on itself. The surgeon then engages the free edge with either forceps or the cystotome needle, and the flap is carried around in a circular manner (Video&#160;7-1). For maximum control of the size of the capsulotomy, frequent regrasping of the flap near the tear is helpful. An OVD may be added to keep the lens surface flat in order to reduce the likelihood of peripheral extension.</p>

			<p class="body-text">The tear should not be allowed to turn either inward (which results in a central opening that is too small) or outward (which leads either to an opening that is too large or to extension of the tear to the posterior capsule). An opening that is too small complicates most nucleus disassembly techniques and may contract postoperatively (capsular phimosis). The overlapping anterior capsule is prone to opacification, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus. A capsulorrhexis that is too large may allow the IOL optic or haptic to dislocate anteriorly. For these reasons, many surgeons advocate a size that allows the capsular rim to cover the optic edge. This technique may become increasingly important with the use of premium IOLs, which require a stable position within the eye for optimal refractive results.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If a CCC cannot be completed, conversion to a can-&#173;opener capsulotomy is an acceptable strategy (see the appendix, Fig&#160;A-1). However, this type of anterior capsulotomy makes hydrodissection, hydrodelineation, and endocapsular phacoemulsification more challenging because of a higher likelihood of posterior capsule extension. A can-&#173;opener capsulotomy is performed by using a cystotome or bent 27-gauge needle to create multiple small tears or punctures in the anterior capsule. These are circumferential to the equator and pulled centrally in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction in order to create a complete opening.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Hydrodissection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hydrodissection is performed to separate the peripheral and posterior cortex from the underlying posterior lens capsule. In addition to loosening the lens-&#173;cortex complex, this procedure facilitates nucleus rotation during phacoemulsification and hydrates the peripheral cortex, making it easier to aspirate after nucleus removal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgeon places a bent, blunt-tipped 25- to 30-gauge cannula or flattened hydrodissection cannula attached to a 3–5-mL syringe under the anterior capsule flap. While carefully lifting the capsular flap, the surgeon injects balanced salt solution in a radial direction. Exerting gentle posterior pressure on the nucleus will express posterior fluid and prevent fluid pressure from rupturing the posterior capsule. Gentle irrigation should continue until the surgeon sees a wave of fluid moving under the nucleus and across the red reflex (Video&#160;7-2). In mature cataracts or in cases without a red reflex, careful hydrodissection should continue until nucleus rotation can be performed. Irrigation in the subincisional area may require a right-&#173;angled or J-shaped hydrodissection cannula.</p>

			<p class="QR-code-caption-first ParaOverride-13"><span class="QR-code-number">VIDEO 7-2</span> Hydrodissection.</p>
			<p class="QR-code-source ParaOverride-22">Courtesy of Linda Tsai, MD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the nucleus is displaced into the anterior chamber, it can be reposited into the posterior chamber with injection of OVD and application of slight posterior pressure. Alternatively, a supracapsular phacoemulsification technique may be selected in this situation. Hydrodissection is riskier after a can-&#173;opener capsulotomy has been performed, with zonular fibers that are weakened, or in a patient who has a posterior polar cataract.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Hydrodelineation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some surgeons also inject balanced salt solution into the substance of the nucleus to <span class="italic">hydrodelineate,</span> or separate, the various layers of the nucleus after hydrodissection. This separates the harder nucleus from the softer epinucleus, which can be left to act as a cushion to protect the underlying posterior capsule. In less brunescent cataracts, a fluid wave can be seen to separate the endonucleus from the epinucleus and produce the “golden ring” sign. In cataracts with a white or densely brunescent nucleus, the epinucleus layer may not be present, making hydrodelineation ineffective.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Nucleus Rotation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If hydrodissection has succeeded in breaking the attachments between peripheral and posterior cortex and the posterior capsule, the surgeon should be able to rotate the nucleus within the capsular bag. Because phacoemulsification techniques are easier to perform when the lens rotates freely, the surgeon should confirm nucleus rotation before proceeding with the procedure. Difficulty in rotation may suggest inadequate hydrodissection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">These maneuvers must be approached with caution in patients with loose zonular fibers. Attempting to rotate the nucleus in such cases will weaken the stability of the capsular bag. Hydrodissection and nucleus rotation may also be avoided in patients with posterior polar cataracts, as adhesions of the lens to the posterior capsule increase the risk of capsular tears or rupture. (See also Chapter&#160;9.)</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Nucleus Disassembly and Removal</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most methods of nucleus disassembly and removal consist of several distinct steps; these include sculpting, cracking, chopping, grasping, and emulsifying. With modern phaco machines, all parameters (power levels and intervals of delivery, aspiration flow rate, and vacuum) can be adjusted for each step of the procedure as well as for the density of the cataract, giving the surgeon maximum control of the process.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There are 2&#160;main modes or settings that are used during phacoemulsification: sculpt and segment removal. With the <span class="italic">sculpt</span> setting, the central nucleus is debulked. This process involves a shaving maneuver in which the tip of the phaco needle is never fully occluded in order to generate minimal vacuum. Thus, the portion of the phaco needle that is in contact with the lens passes through without grabbing, and the lens material can be emulsified and aspirated in a controlled fashion. Sculpting is usually performed with modest vacuum, low aspiration flow, and high phaco power.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The<span class="italic"> segment removal</span> setting is employed once the nucleus has been divided (using one of the techniques described later in this chapter); the resulting fragments are grasped using high vacuum and pulled centrally for emulsification. Full occlusion of the phaco tip is necessary to allow the vacuum to build to the desired level. Once this level has been reached, ultrasound power may be applied. After the nucleus is emulsified, the epinuclear material may be removed with lower flow and aspiration settings with either the phaco handpiece or the I/A instrument (discussed in Irrigation and Aspiration, later in this chapter).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Location of Emulsification</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The nucleus may be emulsified at various locations within the eye, including the posterior chamber, iris plane, and anterior chamber. The location determines which techniques are used to emulsify the nucleus.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-16">Posterior chamber</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The posterior chamber is a common location for nucleus disassembly and emulsification. Removal of the nucleus at this location is facilitated by hydrodissection and nucleus rotation. The advantages of posterior chamber phacoemulsification include the reduced risk of corneal endothelial trauma and the ability to minimize the size of the capsulorrhexis opening, which is helpful with suboptimal pupil dilation. Disadvantages include an increased risk of complications due to the fact that emulsification takes place closer to the posterior capsule, greater stress placed on the capsule and zonular fibers when the nucleus is being manipulated, and the need for sophisticated methods of nucleus splitting.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Iris plane</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When phacoemulsification is performed at the iris plane, one pole of the nucleus is prolapsed anteriorly. Once prolapsed, the nucleus can be manipulated with less stress on the posterior capsule and zonular fibers. Emulsification occurs between the corneal endothelium and the posterior capsule, thereby reducing the risk of damage to either structure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This location is often suitable for the beginning phaco surgeon and advantageous in patients who have compromised capsular or zonular integrity. In patients with small pupils, this technique permits good visualization and enables safe emulsification. The disadvantages of working at the iris plane include difficulty prolapsing the nucleus and the risk of potential damage to the corneal endothelium if the surgeon emulsifies the nucleus too close to the cornea.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Anterior chamber</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This technique involves prolapsing the nucleus through the capsulorrhexis during hydrodissection, which requires a medium to large capsulorrhexis and a relatively soft nucleus. This approach theoretically reduces the stress on the zonular fibers during manipulation of the nucleus. The risks of this technique include a greater chance of aspirating the iris in the phaco tip, as well as damaging the corneal endothelium. However, phacoemulsification in a supracapsular location is a useful technique in certain settings, such as the presence of posterior chamber rupture. Using an OVD to protect the endothelium and minimizing phaco energy are recommended.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Techniques of Nucleus Disassembly</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Phaco fracture technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most widely used 2-handed technique, developed by Howard Gimbel and John Shepherd and referred to as “divide and conquer nucleofractis,” can be effectively applied to all but very soft cataracts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After adequate hydrodissection and hydrodelineation, continuous ultrasound is used to sculpt a deep central linear groove or trough in the nucleus. Signs that the groove depth is adequate include smoothing of the striations in the groove, brightening of the red reflex in the groove, and sculpting to a depth of 2–3&#160;phaco tip diameters (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-16</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">At this point, the surgeon can either separate the nucleus into 2&#160;pieces (nucleus cracking) or rotate the nucleus 90° and sculpt a perpendicular groove (Video&#160;7-3). The phaco tip and second instrument are then inserted into each groove and spread apart with a cross action or parallel action, thereby achieving complete separation of the pieces (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-17</span>).</p>

			<p class="h3">Chopping techniques</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">horizontal phaco chop</span> technique, originally described by Kunihiro Nagahara, does not entail creation of a central groove but instead makes use of the natural fault lines in the lens nucleus for creation of a fracture plane. After burying the phaco tip in the center of the nucleus by using high vacuum, the surgeon inserts a chopping instrument under the anterior capsule flap, deeply engages the endonucleus in the periphery, and draws it toward the phaco tip, thereby cracking the nucleus into 2&#160;pieces (Video&#160;7-4). This technique requires the surgeon to place the chopper under the capsular rim and around the equatorial nucleus. The phaco tip is then buried in 1 of the nuclear halves, and the surgeon uses the chopping instrument in the same fashion to create multiple small wedges of nucleus for emulsification.</p>

			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Vertical chopping</span> techniques have also been described. After the center of the nucleus is impaled with the phaco tip using high vacuum, the surgeon buries a chopper with a sharp tip within the nucleus, just adjacent to the phaco tip. The phaco tip lifts while the chopper depresses, and the surgeon separates the instruments to complete the chop, which occurs along natural fault lines in the nucleus (Video&#160;7-5).</p>

			<p class="QR-code-source ParaOverride-22">Courtesy of Lisa Park, MD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In practice, either the vertical or the horizontal chopping technique can be used with almost any other strategy for disassembly of the nucleus. Chopping is not effective for soft nuclei, such as pure posterior subcapsular cataracts. Other techniques, such as hydrodelineation and aspiration with minimal phaco power, may be more appropriate in these cases.</p>

			<p class="reference-mid">Koch PS, Katzen LE. Stop and chop phacoemulsification. <span class="italic">J&#160;Cataract Refract Surg.</span> 1994;20(5):<br />566–570.</p>
			<p class="reference-last ParaOverride-7">Steinert RF, ed. <span class="italic">Cataract Surgery.</span> 3rd&#160;ed. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2010.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-18">Irrigation and Aspiration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Once phacoemulsification of the nucleus has been completed, a plate of soft epinucleus or transitional cortex may rest on the posterior capsule. The surgeon can use the phaco needle to accomplish I/A without ultrasound; reduced vacuum and flow settings can be employed to aspirate this material from the capsular fornix or posterior capsule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The I/A system can also be used to remove peripheral cortical material by use of either coaxial or bimanual I/A. With coaxial cortical removal, the port is rotated toward the equator of the lens capsule. The cortical material should be engaged under low vacuum and stripped to the center of the inflated capsular bag. The surgeon rotates the port so that it is fully visible, and the cortex can be aspirated under greater vacuum. This procedure is repeated until all of the cortex is removed. If the surgeon finds it difficult to reach the subincisional cortex, a 45°, right-&#173;angled (90°), or U-shaped (180°) aspiration cannula may be useful.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The I/A functions may also be separated using a bimanual technique in which the aspiration port is introduced through the paracentesis incision while irrigation through a second side port maintains the chamber. The instruments may be interchanged as needed (Video&#160;7-6). An advantage of this technique is that it allows the surgeon to more easily reach the subincisional cortex. A disadvantage is that the anterior chamber may become unstable if aspiration outpaces inflow of fluid through the separate handpiece.</p>

			<p class="QR-code-source-recto">Courtesy of Lisa Park, MD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cortex resistant to aspiration can be separated from the capsular bag with OVD (ie, viscodissection) to allow easier access with the I/A handpiece. Another strategy is to postpone removal of residual cortex until after implantation of the IOL. The IOL can be rotated within the capsular bag so that the haptics will further loosen the cortex. The surgeon must weigh the benefits of attempting to remove small amounts of residual cortex against the risk of damaging the posterior capsule. Very small amounts of retained fine cortical strands may easily be resorbed postoperatively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgeon may then polish the posterior and/or anterior capsule surface to remove residual lens epithelial cells, which contribute to development of postoperative capsular opacification. Polishing can be accomplished with gentle aspiration using a sandblasted tip with an abrasive surface or a silicone tip. The surgeon must take care to avoid posterior capsule rupture during this maneuver.</p>
			<p class="reference-first ParaOverride-19">Mathey CF, Kohnen TB, Ensikat HJ, Koch HR. Polishing methods for the lens capsule: histology and scanning electron microscopy. <span class="italic">J&#160;Cataract Refract Surg.</span> 1994;20(1):<br />64–69.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Insertion of the IOL</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In uncomplicated cataract surgery, the surgeon’s goal is generally to place an IOL into the capsular bag. The surgeon must determine whether the support structures within the eye are adequate to maintain IOL centration and stability. With posterior capsule rupture, sufficient anterior capsule support may allow a PCIOL to be safely placed in the ciliary sulcus. Complete lack of capsular support warrants placement of an anterior chamber or a sutured posterior chamber lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In all cases, an OVD is used to fill the capsular bag or expand the ciliary sulcus, stabilize the anterior chamber during IOL insertion, and protect the corneal endothelium from contact with the IOL. The phaco incision must be large enough to accommodate the IOL and inserter; if necessary, the incision may be enlarged after removal of the cataract. For a more detailed discussion of the different types of IOLs that are currently available, see the section IOLs: Historical Perspectives and Lens Modifications, later in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-24">Foldable 1-piece IOLs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A foldable 1-piece IOL is loaded into an injector cartridge that has been prefilled with OVD. The cartridge is inserted into a handpiece, which is operated using a manual plunger or screw mechanism. Preloaded IOL injector systems and automated inserters are also now available. The tip of the injector is then introduced into the corneal wound and the IOL inserted, with the first haptic placed carefully into the capsular bag under direct visualization. The trailing haptic is flexed and placed into position, or “dialed in,” by rotating it clockwise with slight posterior pressure utilizing either the tip of the injector or a second instrument such as a hook, so that the second haptic slides under the anterior capsule (Video&#160;7-7).</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Foldable 3-piece IOLs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Foldable 3-piece IOLs are generally made of an acrylic optic with polypropylene haptics. These lenses can be placed either into the capsular bag or into the ciliary sulcus using an injector or they can be folded in half and placed through the incision using implant forceps. The optic and trailing haptic are positioned using forceps or by dialing the lens, as described in the preceding section.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-24">Polymethyl methacrylate IOLs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) IOLs are not foldable and may be safely inserted with standard, fine-tip, smooth forceps. The phaco incision must be widened to accommodate the size of the lens, and the IOL is advanced by first placing the leading haptic into position and then rotating the optic and trailing haptic into place.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-24">Scleral- or iris-fixated posterior chamber IOLs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several techniques have been described for securing a PCIOL behind the iris when capsular support is inadequate. If the lens is to be sutured to the sclera, polypropylene sutures should be used instead of nylon sutures, because nylon degrades over time and lens dislocation may result. Transscleral polypropylene sutures may be used to secure the IOL haptics in the ciliary sulcus, or the haptics may be sutured to the overlying iris. Alternative techniques have been described whereby the PCIOL haptics are secured via a scleral tunnel, with or without the use of surgical glue.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A scleral-fixated PCIOL is most valuable as an alternative to an anterior chamber IOL (ACIOL) in situations where an angle-&#173;supported lens might be problematic, such as when peripheral anterior synechiae are present or there is significant corneal endothelial compromise. Scleral-&#173;fixation techniques are more difficult than those used in standard implantation and are associated with a greater risk of complications such as vitreous hemorrhage, lens dislocation, lens tilt, or late endophthalmitis.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Anterior chamber IOLs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Modern flexible ACIOLs with 4-point fixation are supported by the anterior chamber angle and considered acceptable for use when implantation in the posterior chamber is not feasible. To determine the appropriate length of the ACIOL, it is common practice to use 1&#160;mm plus the horizontal diameter of the limbus, as measured externally with a caliper (“white to white”).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A typical phaco incision must be enlarged with the keratome or with corneal scissors to enable insertion of an ACIOL. The pupil is generally constricted pharmacologically before IOL implantation, and all vitreous should be removed from the anterior chamber. At least one peripheral iridectomy is performed to avoid pupillary block. The anterior chamber depth is stabilized, and the corneal endothelium protected with an OVD. A lens glide may be inserted across the anterior chamber into the distal angle to isolate the iris from the advancing IOL haptic. The surgeon then inserts the IOL, placing its leading haptic into the angle while observing the iris for any indication of distortion. If a glide has been used, it is removed as the IOL is stabilized with forceps. The posterior lip of the incision is gently retracted to allow placement of the trailing haptic in the angle (Video&#160;7-8). Careful inspection should confirm the proper insertion. The pupil will peak toward any area of iris “tuck,” and the IOL should be repositioned until the pupil is round and the optic is centered. The surgeon can adjust the ACIOL’s position by using a hook to flex the optic toward either angle.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">After IOL Insertion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After removing the cataract and inserting the IOL, the surgeon should remove the OVD from the anterior segment to minimize the risk of an increase in postoperative IOP. In an uncomplicated case with the IOL in the capsular bag, the OVD may be removed by inserting the I/A tip behind the optic or pushing the optic posteriorly to prolapse the OVD and allow its aspiration from the anterior chamber. In the setting of capsular rupture or sulcus IOL placement, removal of viscoelastic should be performed with minimal manipulation of the IOL to avoid destabilization.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To produce a slightly firm eye, balanced salt solution is instilled via the paracentesis incision, to re-form the anterior chamber. The main incision is then examined for adequate closure. If the incision leaks, both sides and/or the roof of the corneal tunnel incision can be hydrated with balanced salt solution injected via a syringe with a blunt 25- to 30-gauge irrigating tip. Hydration of the corneal incision causes temporary stromal swelling and increases the wound apposition between the roof and the floor of the tunnel. This anterior–posterior reapproximation, rather than apposition of the external corneal edges, is the critical anatomical feature that determines good wound closure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With the continuing evolution of techniques for self-&#173;sealing incisions and the use of foldable IOLs, many surgeons elect not to suture the incision at the conclusion of a routine case. Long-term results have shown that the small incisions used in modern cataract surgery heal quickly, are relatively stable, and induce minimal astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If there is wound leakage, however, the surgeon must be ready to use additional means of closure, including placement of a 10-0 nylon suture that can be removed postoperatively at the slit lamp. Incisions may also be closed with corneal sealants such as adhesives and glues.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-28">IOLs: Historical Perspectives and Lens Modifications</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top7">
			<p class="h2-h1">Historical Perspectives</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before 1949, cataract surgery resulted in aphakia, and patients were destined (unless they had high myopia) to wear high-&#173;hyperopic spectacles, which were heavy and caused image magnification and distortion of peripheral vision. When they became available, scleral contact lenses and eventually corneal contact lenses were used instead.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The development of modern IOL implantation began in 1949. Harold Ridley, an En&#173;glish ophthalmologist, observed that PMMA fragments from airplane cockpit windshields were well tolerated in the anterior segment of the eyes of injured World War II pilots. After performing an ECCE on a 45-year-old woman, Ridley placed a disc-shaped PMMA lens into the posterior chamber of her eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-18</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ridley’s lens corrected aphakic vision, but a high incidence of postoperative complications such as glaucoma, uveitis, and dislocation caused him to abandon his design. Though frustrated in his attempts, Ridley showed foresight in 3&#160;important areas. First, he constructed his original lens of PMMA in a biconvex design. Second, he used extracapsular surgery for implantation of the lens. Third, he placed the lens in the posterior chamber. Ridley set the stage for a period of advances in cataract surgery that continues to this day, and he received a knighthood for his contributions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Extracapsular cataract surgery in the 1950s was crude by modern standards and was generally associated with retained lens cortex, which caused fibrosis and adhesions between iris and capsule. ICCE eliminated residual cortical material and became the preferred procedure. Because ICCE was more commonly performed in the early days of lens implantation, IOLs of that period featured optics with loops, struts, or holes for the sutures required for fixation to the iris for support (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-19</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The anterior chamber angle was an alternate site for IOL support. The first ACIOLs, created by Joaquin Barraquer, Benedetto Strampelli, and others, were crude and ultimately required explantation because of severe inflammatory reactions. Fitting the length of the lens to the width of the anterior chamber was difficult. The IOL length was selected by estimating the anterior chamber width on the basis of the horizontal corneal diameter. Because such estimation is inexact even with modern instruments, complications arose. Oversized lenses and closed-loop IOLs caused pupillary distortion and contributed to development of uveitis-&#173;glaucoma-hyphema (UGH) syndrome. ACIOLs that were too short would spin, decenter, and come into contact with the corneal endothelium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Complications associated with rigid ACIOLs spurred the development of flexible, open-loop ACIOLs with 4-point fixation. These modifications have dramatically improved clinical outcomes and allowed ACIOLs to remain an acceptable treatment option for cases with compromised capsular support or for secondary IOL insertion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-20</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Posterior Chamber IOLs and Other Lens Modifications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With advances in cataract surgery technology, the desire to place the IOL in the lens capsule spurred research into posterior chamber lens implantation. Steven Shearing modified a flexible version of a 3-piece IOL with closed loops by opening the loops and inserting the haptics into the capsular bag for posterior chamber placement. Subsequent modifications of this lens by Shearing, Jerry Pierce, and Robert Sinskey allowed ECCE with PCIOL implantation to become the standard for modern cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thomas Mazzocco is generally given credit for developing the foldable IOL (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-21</span>). His plate-style lens design influenced the design of modern phakic refractive IOLs (see BCSC Section&#160;13, <span class="italic">Refractive Surgery</span>). Foldable versions of the Shearing-&#173;style lens soon followed (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-22</span>). The obvious advantage of the foldable-&#173;lens design is that it allows implantation of the IOL through a small incision. The availability of a small-&#173;incision lens influenced many ECCE surgeons’ decision to adopt phacoemulsification as their primary technique.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Currently, most IOLs are manufactured from either silicone or acrylic materials. Although both silicone and acrylic are suitable for the majority of patients, silicone IOLs have caused problems in patients who undergo subsequent vitrectomy with silicone oil injection. When cataract surgery is to be performed in a patient who is likely to later require vitreoretinal surgery (eg, a patient with high myopia, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment in the fellow eye, uveitis, or any disease process that may lead to vitreous hemorrhage), an IOL material other than silicone is preferred.</p>
			<p class="body-text">IOL optic geometry has evolved from the earlier plano-&#173;convex models to the newer biconvex design. Numerous changes in the shape of the posterior IOL surface and edge design were advanced to reduce late opacification of the posterior lens capsule and to facilitate laser capsulotomy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-23</span>). Aspheric platforms to minimize spherical aberrations from the cornea have also been introduced.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other lens modifications include the incorporation of UV-&#173;absorbing chromophores into the IOL material to protect the retina from UV radiation. Blue-&#173;blocking IOLs attenuate blue-&#173;wavelength light (400–460&#160;nm). Proponents of these IOLs contend that they protect the eye, particularly the macula, from blue-light exposure; however, opponents claim that there is no evidence of benefit from blue-&#173;blocking IOLs, and they are concerned that these lenses might create problems with scotopic vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most recently, next-&#173;generation or “premium” IOLs have been developed with the goal of addressing presbyopia and astigmatism without the aid of spectacles. These specialized designs include multifocal, accommodating, toric, and phakic IOLs. Toric IOLs are discussed in the section Modification of Preexisting Astigmatism, later in this chapter.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Multifocal IOLs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The original concept of the multifocal IOL was based on the principle that the pupil tends to constrict for near tasks; thus, the central portion of the lens was designed for near vision and the outer portion for distance vision. A drawback of the original design was that distance correction was not optimal when bright light constricted the pupil. Present versions of these lenses address this problem by having alternating zones for near and distance correction. A combination of geometric optics and diffraction optics can also achieve a multifocal effect. Multiple multifocal lenses have been approved for use in the United States (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-24</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The advantage of these lenses is an increased range of focus with reduced dependence on spectacles. Disadvantages include a reduction in contrast sensitivity and best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (also called <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity</span>) and the presence of glare and halos (see also BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics</span>). The cataract surgeon should spend a sufficient amount of “chair time” counseling patients receiving multifocal IOLs about the intended postoperative visual outcome and limitations; use of a specialized consent process is recommended. Multifocal IOLs require accurate biometry and IOL power calculations, and they may work best when implanted bilaterally and in patients with minimal astigmatism. Patients with hyperopia may be less bothered by some of the visual aberrations associated with these lenses than patients with myopia. The surgeon should be prepared to manage residual postoperative refractive errors with refractive surgery, spectacle or contact lens correction, and possible IOL exchange, preferably performed before capsular fibrosis increases the difficulty of explantation.</p>

Whether these lenses work predominantly by IOL movement or by another mechanism has been an area of debate.</p>

			<p class="h1">Modification of Preexisting Astigmatism</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Elimination of spherical refractive error using IOLs and meticulous implant calculations is certainly possible. Increasingly, correction of astigmatism during cataract surgery has become a priority for both patients and surgeons. Multiple intraoperative methods of astigmatism reduction are available.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because a cataract can induce refractive astigmatism, it is important to compare the preoperative refractive cylinder with keratometry readings. Surgeons should consider that, in aging eyes, there tends to be a natural against-&#173;the-rule drift of corneal astigmatism as a result of flattening of the superior meridian.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the refractive cylinder matches the power and axis obtained by keratometry, cataract-&#173;induced astigmatism is negligible, and the refractive cylinder can be considered for reduction through surgery. Surgical planning for refractive cataract surgery includes consideration of incision size and location. A small incision is unlikely to induce much, if any, corneal astigmatism. If a larger incision is required, placing it across the steeper meridian may reduce preoperative astigmatism. The surgeon may also consider use of peripheral corneal relaxing incisions, toric IOLs, and postoperative astigmatism reduction with photorefractive corneal surgery.

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Astigmatic Keratotomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Astigmatic keratotomy (AK) is a technique dating to the era of refractive keratotomy. Within the cornea, paired incisions are placed at varying distances from the apex of the steepest corneal meridian so as to decrease the curvature of that meridian and increase the curvature of the meridian 90° away (a technique known as <span class="italic">coupling</span>). Glare from the incisional scar is a potential problem for the cataract surgical patient, for whom postoperative quality of vision is paramount. Any infection near the center of the cornea has serious consequences. For these reasons, AK has largely been supplanted by limbal relaxing incisions.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Limbal Relaxing Incisions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Limbal relaxing incisions (LRIs), which might more accurately be called peripheral corneal relaxing incisions, have been advocated as an effective method for reducing <br />0.50–3.00&#160;diopters&#160;(D) of astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The 6- and 12-o’clock meridians are marked with the patient sitting upright. Marks are made at the limbus with either a sterile skin marker or another technique, such as use of a 25-gauge needle in the corneal epithelium. The steep meridian is then identified with these landmarks or other natural landmarks, if they exist. An incision is made at the limbus circumferentially across the steep meridian. One or more incisions are made depending on the surgeon’s choice of nomogram. Some surgeons place the cataract incision within the LRI; others prefer to use a separate location. Use <br />of the femtosecond laser to make incisions prior to cataract surgery shows promise for increasing precision and reproducibility. LRIs may also be done postoperatively in an office setting.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Toric IOLs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Toric IOLs are designed to correct astigmatism without corneal incisions, which helps avoid additional incisional complications. The disadvantages of toric IOLs relate to possible lens rotation away from the desired axis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Careful preoperative corneal measurements and calculations using a toric calculator are essential. To determine the power of the toric IOL, the surgeon must accurately measure the amount of corneal astigmatism, as total refractive astigmatism may include a lenticular component.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Preoperatively, the surgeon marks the 0°, 90°, and 180° axes on the cornea with the patient in the upright position to take into account possible torsional rotation of the eye in the supine position. Either prior to the start of surgery or once the cataract has been removed, the surgeon marks the predetermined axis for lens alignment on the cornea, using the reference marks for accuracy. The IOL is then inserted and rotated carefully into position within the capsular bag.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intraoperative wavefront aberrometry is an innovation that may assist in more accurate IOL selection and placement. This technology uses infrared (IR) light and interferometry both to obtain an aphakic refraction as soon as the cataract has been removed (while the patient is on the operating table) and to confirm proper alignment of a toric IOL. This process allows the surgeon either to rotate the lens to minimize astigmatism or to exchange it immediately if the power is not accurate.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Unintentional postoperative rotation may be more likely when the IOL is implanted in a larger capsular bag. Each degree of rotation reduces the effect of astigmatism correction by approximately 3% and may induce higher-&#173;order aberrations, although a minor misalignment may not be clinically appreciated. If necessary, a second procedure to rotate the lens to the correct axis should be done early in the postoperative period, before complete capsular fixation of the lens occurs.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-29">Alternative Technologies for Cataract Extraction</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top9">
			<p class="h2-h1">Laser Photolysis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Since the advent of phacoemulsification, alternative technologies have been developed to facilitate cataract extraction. The first laser system was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000. The Dodick Photolysis system, a Q-switched Nd:YAG system (A.R.C. Laser Corp, Salt Lake City, UT), generates laser shock waves at 200–400&#160;ns that strike a titanium target at the end of the aspirating handpiece, thereby breaking up the lens nucleus.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Fluid-Based Phacolysis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In 2003, the AquaLase liquefaction device was introduced (Alcon, Ft&#160;Worth, TX). This system generates pulses of heated balanced salt solution for liquefaction and removal of lens material.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Femtosecond Laser Cataract Extraction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In 2010, the US FDA approved femtosecond lasers for cataract extraction. Well known to refractive surgeons, these Nd:glass lasers generate focused, ultrashort pulses (10–15&#160;s) at a wavelength of 1053&#160;nm (in the near-IR region), creating cavitation bubbles within the tissues in a process known as photodisruption. Femtosecond laser technology virtually eliminates collateral damage and can therefore be used to dissect tissue on a microscopic scale, enabling creation of corneal incisions and capsulotomies, as well as subsequent lens disassembly.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Currently, 4&#160;femtosecond laser technology platforms for cataract surgery are commercially available in the United States: Catalys (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA), LenSx (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX), Lensar (LENSAR, Orlando, FL), and Victus (Bausch&#160;+ Lomb, Bridgewater, NJ).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prior to surgery, parameters such as the location of wounds and arcuate incisions are entered into the system’s computer. For the capsulotomy, the intended size and centration method are selected. For lens fragmentation, the systems offer a choice of segmentation in quadrants, sextants, or other geometric patterns.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the eye is dilated, the patient is positioned and secured in the supine position. A suction ring is placed on the eye and filled with balanced salt solution. The ring is then connected to the laser lens unit. After the ring system is placed on the eye and “docking” has been confirmed, the system automatically measures the dimensions of the anterior chamber and the lens with 3-dimensional spectral-&#173;domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) or Scheimpflug imaging, mapping the ocular surfaces and creating laser exclusion zones. The surgeon then activates the femtosecond laser by depressing the foot pedal. Focal photodisruption creates the previously determined capsulotomy, corneal incisions, and lens fragmentation grid patterns.</p>
			<p class="body-text">During lens fragmentation, the gas released from the cavitation bubbles creates a pneumodissection effect, which separates the crystalline lens along the natural lamellar structure, reducing the need for hydrodissection and occasionally creating cubes of softened lens. This part of the procedure takes approximately 30–60&#160;seconds.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After the laser portion of the procedure is finished, the ring system is released and removed from the eye. Some surgeons instill additional dilating eyedrops at this point to address possible laser-&#173;induced miosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The patient is then positioned beneath the operating microscope for lens removal using phacoemulsification. The surgeon must first verify that the capsulotomy is complete and carefully remove the anterior capsule with forceps before proceeding with nucleus removal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Complications related to femtosecond laser–assisted cataract surgery may include subconjunctival hemorrhage due to use of the suction ring; incomplete capsulotomy, which may lead to a radial capsular tear; and buildup of gas bubbles within the capsular bag, which could lead to posterior capsule rupture, particularly in the setting of aggressive hydrodissection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Since the femtosecond laser was introduced into cataract surgery, its utility has been intensely debated within the ophthalmological community. Proponents of this approach extol its precision, reproducibility, and safety. Those who doubt its merits usually cite the higher costs involved and point out that similar results can be achieved by small-&#173;incision phacoemulsification as it is currently practiced.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-28">Outcomes of Cataract Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top10">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Contemporary cataract surgery has an excellent success rate in both improving visual acuity and enhancing subjective visual function. More than 90% of otherwise healthy eyes achieve a best-&#173;corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better after surgery. The rate of achieving a postoperative visual acuity of 20/40 or better for all eyes has been reported to be 85%–89% when eyes with comorbid conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-&#173;related macular degeneration are included.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Visual acuity is only one measure of the functional success of cataract surgery. Research tools have been developed to assess how cataract progression and cataract surgery affect visual function (see Chapter&#160;6). Prospective studies using these tools show that patients who undergo cataract surgery have significant improvement in many quality-&#173;of-life parameters, including performance of community and home activities, number of falls, mental health, driving ability, and life satisfaction.</p>
