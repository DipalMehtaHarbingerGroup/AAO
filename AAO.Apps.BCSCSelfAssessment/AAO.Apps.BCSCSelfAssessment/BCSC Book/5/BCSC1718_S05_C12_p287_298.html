			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Head Pain</p>
				<div id="Chapt12_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Headache is a common complaint presented to the ophthalmologist. When pain extends to the orbits, the patient and referring physician may assume that the eyes are in some way responsible for the discomfort. Often the patient may have fears, perhaps unspoken, of a brain tumor.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most important part of an evaluation for headache is the patient’s history, because in the vast majority of such patients, the results of the ocular examination are normal (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;12-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to receiving a complete ophthalmic examination, the patient reporting the headache should be screened systemically, including having measurements taken of blood pressure and pulse and undergoing neurologic examination for meningeal signs (eg, neck stiffness), focal tenderness, and integrity of cranial nerve (CN) function. Any reports of visual phenomena should prompt careful visual field testing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The International Headache Society (IHS) classification scheme, which was designed in 1988 and revised in 2013, separates <span class="italic">primary</span> headaches (eg, migraine, tension-&#173;type, and trigeminal autonomic cephalgias) from <span class="italic">secondary</span> headaches (ie, headaches resulting from other causes).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several clinical features of headache may suggest the need for neuroimaging and additional diagnostic testing. The “SNOOP” mnemonic is a useful tool for identifying the red flags of a potentially serious headache:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">S</span>ystemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, or myalgias) or <span class="italic">S</span>econdary risk factors (immunosuppression or systemic cancer)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">N</span>eurologic symptoms (eg, confusion, impaired alertness or consciousness, neck stiffness, or association of headache with physical exertion or change in body position) or signs (eg, papilledema, CN&#160;III palsy, or homonymous visual field defects)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">O</span>nset: sudden, abrupt, or split-second</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">O</span>lder: new onset and progressive headache, especially in patients 50&#160;years or older</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">P</span>revious headache history: first headache or different (change in attack frequency, severity, or clinical features)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">Table&#160;12-2</span> summarizes the diagnosis and management of some common headache and related facial pain syndromes.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Giant cell arteritis (GCA)</span> or temporal arteritis should be suspected in patients older than 50&#160;years with new headaches. Symptoms of this condition also include jaw claudication, fever, weight loss, scalp tenderness, polymyalgia, fatigue, and visual symptoms. Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; Westergren method) and C-reactive protein testing can help screen such patients, but a normal ESR test result does not exclude a diagnosis of GCA (see Chapter&#160;14). Tenderness over the temporal artery (particularly if the artery is enlarged or nodular) may support the diagnosis and indicate the region of greatest yield for a biopsy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Headache caused by <span class="italic">elevated intracranial pressure,</span> as with intracranial mass lesions or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is typically global, constant, and worse in the morning. Bending over or moving the head often worsens pain, as does Valsalva maneuver from coughing and straining. Vomiting may occur even without nausea. Other focal, nonlocalizing neurologic signs such as CN&#160;VI palsy or papilledema may be present. Pulsatile tinnitus and transient visual loss are common associated symptoms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A sudden severe headache accompanied by neck stiffness, change in mentation, or focal neurologic signs suggests <span class="italic">intracranial hemorrhage.</span> Neuroimaging is urgently required in such cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Headache caused by meningitis may be chronic and not associated with focal neurologic deficits. Neck stiffness and pain on flexion, back pain, pain on eye movement, and photophobia may suggest meningeal inflammation.</p>

			<p class="h2">Migraine and Tension-type Headache</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Migraine is a common disabling primary headache disorder consisting of repetitive bouts of headache. Approximately 6%–8% of men and 15%–18% of women in North America and Europe experience migraine annually. A familial tendency for migraine is strong, and the patient may report having had motion sickness as a child. Onset of migraine may be linked to times of hormonal change, such as during puberty or young adulthood, and migraine episodes may decrease after menopause. Support for a diagnosis of migraine includes the unilaterality or pulsating character of the pain and associated symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, and aggravation of pain with routine physical activity. Migraine may be exacerbated by menstruation, pregnancy, hunger, stress, certain foods (eg, chocolate or wine), and sleep deprivation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Migraine without aura</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Migraine without aura, which comprises 65% of all migraine, has no preceding neurologic symptoms. This type of headache may be global, asymmetric bilateral, or unilateral and can last hours to days. Distinguishing between it and the very common tension-&#173;type headache (see the section “Tension-&#173;type headache”) may be challenging.</p>
			<p class="h3">Migraine with aura</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Migraine with aura, which comprises 30% of all migraines, is heralded by neurologic symptoms that are most commonly visual. Because they originate from the occipital lobes as a result of cortical spreading depression, visual symptoms in migrainous aura are <span class="italic">always</span> binocular (although the patient may report them as monocular in the eye that has the symptom in the temporal visual field). The aura builds over minutes, with positive visual phenomena that typically have movement. The classic <span class="italic">scintillating scotoma with fortification spectrum</span> commonly begins with a small scotoma that gradually expands into the peripheral vision (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-1</span>). The scotoma is bounded by a zigzag, shimmering, colorful, or silvery image that moves temporally into the periphery and then breaks up. Loss of vision may occur, and the presence of both positive and negative phenomena is the hallmark of migraine aura. The aura typically lasts between 5 and 60&#160;minutes and is usually followed by a contralateral throbbing headache. The aura always completely resolves. Most patients experience associated nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. When untreated, migraine attacks typically last from 4&#160;hours to 72&#160;hours.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Studies of migraine pathophysiology have found evidence for primary dysfunction involving the afferent sensory neurons of CN&#160;V. Activation of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis is thought to cause the release of vasoactive chemokines at the vascular endings of CN&#160;V. These neuropeptides are thought to cause dilation of the pial arteries, increase vascular permeability, and induce an inflammatory response that activates trigeminal afferent fibers within the walls of blood vessels.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Genetic factors with a substantial familial incidence (eg, familial hemiplegic migraine, a rare autosomal dominant form of migraine) have suggested that increased neuronal excitability is a primary event in migraine. This condition may underlie the spreading depression in the occipital region thought to be responsible for the visual aura and the blood vessel changes that result in pain, as well as the brainstem or bilateral hemispheric symptoms of basilar-&#173;type migraine.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Typical aura without headache</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some patients may report only the visual symptoms of migraine aura, without an associated headache. This typical aura without headache, previously termed <span class="italic">acephalgic migraine</span> comprises 5% of all migraines and must be differentiated from transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Typical aura without headache mainly occur in adults with a prior history of migraine with aura. The typical manifestation of migraine aura is scintillating scotoma and, less commonly, transient homonymous hemianopia without positive visual phenomena or peripheral visual field constriction that progresses to tunnel vision or complete vision loss. Symptoms typically last 5–60&#160;minutes and always completely resolve. A patient experiencing positive visual phenomena or a family history of migraine with aura is helpful for diagnosis, as is the presence of the classic scintillating scotoma with fortification spectrum. The absence of these features or the presence of residual visual field defects or a bruit should raise suspicion of another underlying process, such as cerebrovascular disease or a vascular malformation, and prompt urgent brain imaging.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Evaluation of patients with migraine</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If the patient has a typical history of migraine and the results of neurologic and ophthalmic examination are normal, neuroimaging studies are unlikely to show an intracranial abnormality. A history of visual phenomena and hemicranial headaches on both sides suggests a benign etiology. Although symptoms that occur strictly on one side are more worrisome, patients with this clinical presentation are also likely to have migraine. Occasionally, a mass lesion or a large vascular malformation is heralded by typical migraine symptoms, but in such cases, there are often residual visual field defects (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-2</span>; see also Chapter&#160;14). Such a finding underlines the importance of visual field testing in the evaluation of patients with presumed migrainous visual aura. Referral of patients with suspicious headaches to a neurologist is prudent. The following findings may suggest the need for additional evaluation of those patients presumed to have migraine:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Headache or aura always occurring on the same side</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Headache preceding the aura</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Neurologic deficit, including visual field defect, persisting after aura resolves</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-4">Atypical aura (more than 1&#160;aura occurring in a single day, lack of expansion of or change in aura, duration less than 5&#160;minutes or more than 60&#160;minutes)<p class="reference-single ParaOverride-3">Frishberg BM, Rosenberg JH, Matchar DB, et al; for the US Headache Consortium.

			</ul>
			<p class="h3">Tension-type headache</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tension-type headaches are chronic, described as aching or viselike, typically worse at the end of the day, and often precipitated by stress. They are not associated with typical auras. The specific pathophysiology and treatment of tension-&#173;type headaches remain unclear. Such headaches may be associated with depression.</p>
			<p class="h3">Treatment of migraine and tension-type headache</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The specific type of headache and the needs of the patient should guide treatment. Some patients, for example, need only reassurance that they do not have serious intracranial disease. Precipitating or contributing factors should be eliminated as much as possible. Certain foods provoke headaches in some people, and patients should consider avoiding the potential triggers of chocolate, nitrates, monosodium glutamate, aged cheese, caffeine, wine and other alcoholic beverages, aspartame-&#173;based sweeteners, nuts, and shellfish. The role of estrogens and oral contraceptives is uncertain, but a temporal relationship between initiation of hormone therapy and the development of migraine symptoms suggests a causal relationship.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other environmental migraine triggers include stress or relief from stress, change in sleep patterns, fumes or strong scents such as perfumes and cigarette smoke, and exercise.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Migraine therapy consists of treatment for the acute symptoms as well as prophylactic management. For treatment of acute symptoms, various drugs can be used, including serotonin 5-HT<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1B/1D</span>-&#173;receptor agonists (triptans), nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), dihydroergotamine, and other combination drugs that include caffeine (long-term caffeine intake, however, worsens headaches). An antiemetic drug may also be necessary. The triptans (eg, sumatriptan, rizatriptan, zolmitriptan, frovatriptan, and almotriptan) are useful for symptomatic relief of the migrainous headache but should be used cautiously in patients with migraine with aura and only after the aura resolves to avoid vasoconstriction-&#173;induced infarct. Though rare, these drugs can also cause myocardial infarction and are typically not used for patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Analgesic medications should be prescribed with caution, and narcotics should be avoided. The use of analgesic medications for more than 15&#160;days per month can lead to <span class="italic">analgesic rebound headache,</span> characterized by a constant headache that is relieved only with the continuous use of pain medications. Therefore, obtaining a thorough medication history from patients with headache is important. Treatment of analgesic rebound headaches requires the withdrawal of analgesics, and hospitalization may be needed. <span class="italic">Prophylactic</span> treatment is warranted if headaches disrupt activities of daily living beyond what the patient is willing to tolerate. Topiramate, an antiepileptic <span class="greek--tx-">c</span>-aminobutyrate (gamma-&#173;aminobutyric acid, or GABA) agonist, has been increasingly prescribed for patients with migraine. However, a syndrome characterized by acute myopic shift, ciliochoroidal effusion, and acute bilateral angle-&#173;closure glaucoma can occur in some patients using topiramate (see BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Alternatively, beta-&#173;blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), sodium valproate, and gabapentin may be used as prophylactic drugs, as may NSAIDs if their potential for causing analgesic rebound headaches is kept in mind. Oral administration of magnesium and riboflavin can be effective for some patients, as well as pericranial botulinum toxin injections. Tension-&#173;type headaches are more likely to respond to treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, topiramate, gabapentin, muscle relaxants, and NSAIDs, although the overall rate of success with such drugs is not as high as for migraine. Various forms of biofeedback may be helpful.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalgias and Hemicrania Continua</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The trigeminal autonomic cephalgias (TACs) include cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, and short-&#173;lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT). The TACs are primary headache disorders characterized by short-&#173;lasting unilateral head pain that occurs with ipsilateral cranial autonomic findings. They can be difficult to treat and are best managed by neurologists.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cluster headache</span> is 3–4&#160;times as common in men as in women. Although the typical age of onset is in the second and third decades of life, it can occur at any age and is typically precipitated by alcohol use. Cluster headache is characterized by excruciating bouts of pain lasting 15&#160;minutes to 180&#160;minutes and localized behind one eye in the distribution of the ophthalmic division of CN&#160;V (V<span class="CharOverride-1">1</span>). Associated features include ipsilateral tearing, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea, and transient (although it can become permanent) postganglionic Horner syndrome. The pain may wake the patient from sleep and cause restlessness. Headaches occur in clusters of episodes over days or weeks, typically beginning like clockwork at the same time of day, then remit for months or years, suggesting that the hypothalamus may play a role in the pathogenesis. Cluster headaches can be difficult to treat. Abortive drugs include subcutaneous or intranasal triptans, inhaled oxygen, dihydroergotamine, and intranasal lidocaine. Verapamil, lithium, methysergide, corticosteroids, topiramate, and gabapentin can be useful for prophylaxis.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Paroxysmal hemicrania</span> is characterized by short, severe attacks of pain with cranial autonomic features that occur several times daily. The headache typically lasts between 2&#160;minutes and 30&#160;minutes but may persist for hours. A dramatic resolution of the headache occurs with indomethacin administration.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">SUNCT</span> is characterized by unilateral orbital or temporal pain that is severe and throbbing or stabbing. The headache typically occurs more than 20&#160;times per day, lasts 5&#160;seconds to 240&#160;seconds, and is often associated with conjunctival injection and tearing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Unlike the other TACs, hemicrania continua is characterized by a continuous unilateral headache of variable intensity that waxes and wanes without disappearing completely. The forehead, temple, orbit, and occiput are common sites of pain. Autonomic symptoms are present in most patients. This primary headache disorder is also responsive to treatment with indomethacin.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Idiopathic Stabbing Headache</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Also known as “ice pick headache” and “jabs and jolts syndrome,” idiopathic stabbing headache manifests as episodic, momentary, sharp, jabbing pains and occurs more commonly in patients with migraine than in those with other types of headaches. Patients with cluster headaches also have a high incidence of idiopathic stabbing headache, typically occurring in the same area as the cluster pain. The most common location for such headaches is in the distribution of V<span class="CharOverride-1">1</span>, particularly the orbit, and less commonly the parietal, temporal, facial, occipital, and retroauricular regions. The pain may last less than a second or may occur as a series of stabbing sensations. Idiopathic stabbing headache often responds to indomethacin administration, and many patients improve with standard prophylactic headache drugs.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Inherited Encephalopathies Resembling Migraine</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Mitochondrial myopathy and encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS)</span> is a hereditary mitochondrial disorder occurring in children and young adults. Its symptoms (headache, nausea, vomiting, transient hemianopia, and hemiparesis) suggest migraine, but permanent neurologic disturbance occurs with spongiform cortical degeneration. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate levels are elevated, and hyperintense lesions may be observed on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Headache resembling migraine may also occur as the initial symptom of <span class="italic">cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy &#173;(CADASIL),</span> an autosomal dominant angiopathy that is associated with a mutation in the <span class="italic">NOTCH3</span> gene on chromosome&#160;19. Headaches occur in 30%–40% of patients with &#173;CADASIL and often arise later in life than typical migraine. Recurrent lacunar strokes with neurologic deficits and cognitive decline eventually occur. Widespread leukoencephalopathy, particularly within the temporal and frontal lobes, is apparent on MRI.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Ocular and Orbital Pain</p>
				<div id="Chapt12_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">There is a popular misconception that “eye strain” due to refractive errors and strabismus is a common cause of eye and head pain. Although refractive errors and strabismus should be corrected as appropriate, and such corrections may ameliorate pain, ocular or orbital pain has many more potentially serious causes. The eye is heavily innervated by sensory nerve fibers (see Chapter&#160;1), and inflammatory, ischemic, and even neoplastic involvement of the eye and orbit can produce pain. True ophthalmic causes of eye pain include dry eye and other forms of keratitis, acute angle-&#173;closure glaucoma, and intraocular inflammation. These conditions are most commonly diagnosed through examination of the cornea, anterior segment, and anterior vitreous using a slit lamp. In addition, periocular pain may be referred facial pain (see the section Facial Pain).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Dry eye is a very common cause of ophthalmic discomfort (See Chapter&#160;3 in BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>). Exacerbated by visual tasks that decrease blink frequency, especially those involving long periods of computer use, it has various causes and results from conditions that either decrease tear production or increase tear evaporation. Pain on awakening may be related to recurrent corneal erosion syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Causes of ocular pain that are unrelated to keratitis include acute angle-&#173;closure glaucoma, which may be confirmed with gonioscopy and intraocular pressure measurements. Scleritis is usually accompanied by ocular tenderness. Posterior segment examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy or slit-lamp biomicroscopy may reveal evidence of choroidal or retinal inflammation or posterior scleritis. These causes of ocular pain are discussed in more detail in BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> and Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Orbital inflammation</span> or infection <span class="italic">(orbital cellulitis)</span> usually produces severe eye pain or pain on eye movement, variably accompanied by ocular motility abnormalities, eyelid edema, and proptosis (see BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System</span>). Periorbital pain may be the initial manifestation of inflammation or thrombosis within the cavernous sinus. Pain with eye movement commonly accompanies an <span class="italic">inflammatory or demyelinating optic neuropathy</span> (see Chapter&#160;4), often in association with decreased vision, visual field changes, and a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). Rapidly expanding tumors of the orbit, orbital apex, and cavernous sinus may also produce eye pain. In these cases, other signs will likely be present, such as a visual field defect, proptosis, ocular motility deficit, resistance to retropulsion of the globe, an RAPD, or an abnormal optic nerve appearance. Microvascular cranial neuropathies (CN&#160;III, IV, or&#160;VI) can cause retro-&#173;orbital pain, with associated abnormal ocular motility.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Occipital neuralgia, which is discussed later in this chapter, produces pain and tenderness over the greater occipital nerve that radiates to the ipsilateral eye area.</p>
			<p class="h2">Trochlear Headache and Trochleitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Trochlear headache, or trochleitis, is an underdiagnosed orbital cause of headache. Patients with this condition typically present with a history of months to years of chronic orbital pain. Inflammation of the trochlea causes localized pain, swelling, and tenderness, and there may be associated limitation of eye movement. When there is no obvious orbital inflammation, the diagnosis can be made by eliciting pain with palpation of the involved trochlea. The etiology is usually idiopathic, but trochleitis can be associated with systemic autoimmune diseases. This condition primarily (90%) occurs in women. Treatment includes local injection of corticosteroids in the region of the trochlea or high doses of NSAIDs.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Photophobia occurs most frequently as a result of ocular inflammatory disorders, including keratitis and uveitis (particularly iritis), and less commonly from chorioretinitis, retinal degenerative disorders, and lesions along the course of the anterior or retrochiasmal visual pathway. Photophobia may also occur because of meningeal irritation (eg, meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage) or migraine and is commonly reported by patients with traumatic brain injury.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-10">Facial Pain</p>
				<div id="Chapt12_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients may refer localized facial pain to the eye. Common sources of facial pain include dental disorders and sinus disease. Other facial pain syndromes include trigeminal neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome, and herpes zoster neuralgia. The last can be associated with facial and/or auditory nerve involvement in herpes zoster oticus or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The onset of facial pain in an elderly patient may indicate GCA. Facial pain is occasionally a sign of nasopharyngeal carcinoma or perineural infiltration of skin cancer (squamous cell, basal cell, or melanoma) affecting the trigeminal nerve or dura at the base of the brain.</p>
			<p class="h2">Trigeminal Neuralgia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Trigeminal neuralgia, also known as <span class="italic">tic douloureux,</span> typically occurs during middle age or later. It is essential to differentiate primary (classic) trigeminal neuralgia (no obvious cause and completely normal examination in between episodes) from secondary (symptomatic) trigeminal neuralgia, in which a lesion affecting the trigeminal nerve can be identified. In 80%–90% of cases, the neuralgia is caused by vascular compression of CN&#160;V, although secondary trigeminal neuralgia may also result from demyelinating disease, an infiltrative process, or a posterior fossa mass lesion. In primary trigeminal neuralgia, the pain is almost always unilateral (95%) and involves V<span class="CharOverride-1">2</span> or V<span class="CharOverride-1">3</span>; involvement of V<span class="CharOverride-1">1</span> alone is rare (&lt;5%) and suggests a secondary cause. Chewing, tooth brushing, or a cold wind may precipitate paroxysmal burning or electric shock–like jabs, which last seconds to minutes. There may be periods of remission.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sensory function in the face should be normal on testing in primary trigeminal neuralgia; hypoesthesia, anesthesia, or dysesthesia increases the likelihood of a secondary cause. These patients should have neuroimaging of the posterior fossa, preferably MRI. Treatment options include use of the medications gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, baclofen, clonazepam, and valproic acid; selective destruction of trigeminal fibers (rhizotomy); or surgical decompression of CN&#160;V in the posterior fossa.</p>
			<p class="h2">Occipital Neuralgia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Paroxysmal stabbing pain in the distribution of the greater or lesser occipital nerves may be confused with other causes of head and facial pain. Tenderness may be elicited with pressure over the affected nerve. Injection of local anesthetic drugs relieves the pain and is helpful in confirming the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Temporomandibular Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pain from the temporomandibular area may arise from either the joint or the muscle. Joint pain exacerbated by chewing or talking suggests joint disease. A click or pop with limited jaw opening may be present. Pain from the muscle is more difficult to diagnose, as it may be referred to the ear, preauricular area, or neck. Jaw pain or claudication in an elderly patient may be an early symptom of GCA.</p>
			<p class="h2">Internal Carotid Artery Dissection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Internal carotid artery dissection typically produces pain localized to the face (see Chapter&#160;14). It is often accompanied by ipsilateral sympathetic dysfunction (Horner syndrome) due to involvement of the sympathetic fibers in the wall of the carotid artery (see Chapter&#160;10, Fig&#160;10-4).</p>
			<p class="h2">Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When herpes zoster involves CN&#160;V dermatomes, pain may arise in the affected region days before a vesicular eruption appears (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-3</span>). The pain is described as aching or burning. Occasionally, no vesicles are apparent <span class="italic">(zoster sine herpete).</span> Acutely, the pain may be exacerbated by concomitant iritis. The pain may persist long after resolution of the acute infection <span class="italic">(postherpetic neuralgia),</span> and it can be extremely discomforting and difficult to treat. Pregabalin, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, and topical 5% lidocaine patches may be effective for some patients. Treatment with antiviral drugs during the acute phase may decrease the risk of severe postherpetic neuralgia. The zoster vaccine, offered to immunocompetent persons aged 60&#160;years and older, significantly reduces the incidence of herpes zoster and markedly decreases the incidence and morbidity of postherpetic neuralgia. (See Chapter&#160;7 in BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for further discussion on herpes zoster.)</p>
			<p class="reference-single--no-space-">Oxman MN, Levin MJ, Johnson GR, et al; Shingles Prevention Study Group. A vaccine to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in older adults. <span class="italic">N&#160;Engl J&#160;Med.</span> 2005; 352(22):2271–2284.</p>
			<p class="h2">Neoplastic Processes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Facial numbness with or without pain suggests pathologic involvement of CN&#160;V, such as neoplastic processes that affect the nerve in the area of the cavernous sinus and the Meckel cave. Rapidly growing tumors, such as aggressive undifferentiated malignancies, may produce pain in a large percentage of patients. Facial cutaneous malignancy may be associated with <span class="italic">perineural invasion</span> and cause progressive pain, numbness, and multiple CN palsies. Patients should therefore be specifically questioned about prior facial malignancies. Orbital imaging may reveal enlargement of the inferior or superior orbital nerves; a biopsy of these nerves can confirm the diagnosis.</p>
