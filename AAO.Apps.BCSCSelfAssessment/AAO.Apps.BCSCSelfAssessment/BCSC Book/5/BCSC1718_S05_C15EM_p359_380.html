			<p class="em-only_endmatter-sq-text">Please note that these questions are <span class="italic">not</span> part of your CME reporting process. They are provided here for self-&#173;assessment and identification of personal professional practice gaps. The required CME posttest is available online (see “Requesting Continuing Medical Education Credit”). Following the questions are a blank answer sheet and answers with discussions. Although a concerted effort has been made to avoid ambiguity and redundancy in these questions, the authors recognize that differences of opinion may occur regarding the “best” answer. The discussions are provided to demonstrate the rationale used to derive the answer. They may also be helpful in confirming that your approach to the problem was correct or, if necessary, in fixing the principle in your memory. The Section&#160;5 faculty thanks the Self-&#173;Assessment Committee for reviewing these self-&#173;assessment questions.</p>

			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">a. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">The oculosympathetic nerves and cranial nerves (CNs) III, IV, V, and VI are all contained within the cavernous sinus; the optic nerve is not. CNs III, IV, and V are located within the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. CN VI is located inside the cavernous sinus.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;2.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> The pupillary response to light is mediated by parasympathetic neurons and involves midbrain pretectal nuclei that send fibers to the Edinger-Westphal subnuclei of the CN III nucleus. The parasympathetic fibers synapse in the ciliary ganglion before projecting in the short ciliary nerve to the iris sphincter.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;3.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is often seen in patients with kidney disease. The risk of NSF increases with lower glomerular filtration rate because the kidneys are primarily responsible for clearing gadolinium contrast. Chronic liver disease is not a significant risk factor for NSF. Heart and lung disease are not associated with NSF.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;4.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">The magnetic field may dislodge a metallic foreign body. In patients with intraocular metallic foreign bodies, this may result in severe damage to the eye. Exposure to ionizing radiation and lack of sagittal imaging and are problems associated with computed tomography (CT) scans. Overestimation of vascular stenosis can occur with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) scans.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;5.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">a.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) depends on changes in regional blood flow in the brain in response to metabolic demand. The basis for most fMRI is measurement of differences in blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) responses during performance of specific tasks such as speech or finger movement. This method uses the </span><span class="CharOverride-12">change in magnetic susceptibility of hemoglobin (Hb) as it changes from oxyHb (diamag</span><span class="CharOverride-12">netic) to deoxyHb (paramagnetic) and is followed by an increase in cerebral blood flow. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is used to assess the metabolism and integrity of neural tissue in vivo. Positron emission tomography (PET) shows metabolic perfusion and is performed with systemically administered radioisotopes with a short half-life followed by imaging of the positrons produced during their decay. Finally, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) uses an iodinated radiotracer or technetium-99m to assess cerebral perfusion and metabolism.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;6.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Visual evoked potential (VEP) testing measures electrical signals over the occipital cortex produced in response to a visual stimulus. It shows an increased latency in demyelination. Other optic neuropathies generally have a normal latency but may show a decrease in the VEP’s amplitude.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;7.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">a. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Angiography may demonstrate delayed or absent choroidal filling in a patient with giant cell arteritis. This may be either with or without optic nerve head (ONH) edema. Other causes of optic nerve swelling may show ONH leakage on angiography but will not show delayed choroidal filling.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;8.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">A large relative afferent pupillary defect is highly suggestive of unilateral or asymmetric optic neuropathy. A mild relative afferent pupillary defect can be seen with significant asymmetric retinal damage involving the macula. Color vision may be altered in patients with maculopathies or optic neuropathies. A central scotoma may be seen in both maculopathies and optic neuropathies. Mild optic nerve head pallor is common in numerous chronic retinopathies such as cone dystrophies.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;9.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">An abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showing at least one white-matter lesion consistent with demyelinating disease is the best predictor of multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients after a first episode of optic neuritis. The risk for developing MS is estimated at 72% after 15 years in patients with presence of abnormalities on MRI compared with approximately 25% in patients with normal brain MRI at presentation.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;10.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">a. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Nerve fiber bundle defects leading to constriction of visual fields are often observed on perimetry of patients with ONH drusen but are rarely noticed by patients. ONH edema typically only occurs with another optic nerve disorder. Drusen are not associated with cystoid macular edema. Peripapillary choroidal neovascular membranes are very rare and can produce severe visual loss when they bleed.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;11.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy causes isolated, sudden, permanent vision loss, often preceded by or associated with episodes of transient visual loss or episodes of transient diplopia.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;12.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">d. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">An acute painful Horner syndrome is highly suggestive of an ipsilateral internal carotid artery dissection, especially in a patient with recurrent episodes of transient monocular visual loss. Hemiparesis contralateral to the eye involved or retinal emboli in the affected eye both suggest a possible internal carotid artery stenosis, but these findings are not specifically suggestive of dissection. Diplopia should be expected with vascular events in the posterior circulation.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;13.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> The dorsal occipitoparietal pathway is the “where” pathway; it is responsible for visuospatial analysis, localization of objects, and visually directed movements toward objects. Balint syndrome results from bilateral occipitoparietal lesions and consists of the triad of simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, and ocular motor apraxia. Lesions of the medial longitudinal fasciculus produce internuclear ophthalmoplegia. The ventral occipitotemporal pathway is the “what” pathway, which is responsible for color, shape, and pattern recognition. Lesions of the bilateral ventral occipitotemporal pathway cause object agnosia. Lesions of the optic tract cause complete or incomplete homonymous hemianopia.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;14.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Due to the relative conduction delay within an optic nerve that has been affected by demyelinating optic neuritis compared with the contralateral unaffected optic nerve, an ob</span><span class="CharOverride-12">ject moving in a single plane may be perceived as tracing an elliptical rather than straight path. This illusion is referred to as the Pulfrich phenomenon. Riddoch phenomenon refers to the ability to see moving but not static objects in a blind hemifield (staticokinetic dissociation). Palinopsia is the perseveration of a visual image after removal of the original stimulus. Optic ataxia is the inability to perform visually guided movements.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;15.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> In rare cases, lesions involving the mesencephalon (midbrain) cause formed, often constant hallucinations frequently associated with an inverted sleep-wake cycle (peduncular hallucinosis). There may be accompanying neurologic symptoms depending on the extent of the midbrain lesion. Disorders of the nondominant parieto-occipital area cause palinopsia, the illusion of persistent afterimages that may be associated with visual hallucinations. Temporal lobe lesions most often produce olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, and visual phenomena from this area are usually complex, formed hallucinations in the ipsilateral or contralateral visual field. Occipital lobe lesions commonly cause unformed hallucinations, which are sometimes described as geometric colors or patterns.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;16.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c</span><span class="CharOverride-12">. The superior oblique muscle intorts, depresses, and abducts the eye. A patient with a bilateral CN IV palsy presents with crossed hypertropia (right hypertropia on left gaze and left hypertropia on right gaze), extorsion of at least 10°, a large V-pattern esotropia (esotropia greatest on downgaze), and chin down positioning (as hypertropia decreases in upgaze). Intorsion of the hypertropic eye accompanies a skew deviation in the ocular tilt reaction. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;17.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> Ocular neuromyotonia, in which episodic diplopia lasting 30</span><span class="CharOverride-12">–</span><span class="CharOverride-12">60 seconds develops after sustained activation of a cranial ocular motor nerve, is usually associated with a history of radiation therapy for a skull-based neoplasm.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;18.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> A lesion of the brachium of the superior colliculus will produce a relative afferent pupillary defect in the absence of color vision loss or a visual field defect. The relative afferent pupillary defect will be ipsilateral to the CN IV palsy due to the decussation of nasal pupillary fibers at the chiasm and the decussation of CN IV after it exits the brainstem. A contralateral Horner syndrome may occur due to the proximity of the descending sympathetic fibers. A homonymous hemianopia would not occur with a pure brainstem injury. Ipsilateral facial weakness would not localize to the midbrain.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;19.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Aberrant regeneration of CN III occurs after damage results in regrowth and misrouting of fibers with innervation of muscles not normally activated together. This causes abnormal synkinetic phenomenon such as eyelid retraction with adduction or pupillary miosis with supraduction, adduction, or infraduction. Eyelid retraction with supraduction is a normal response to CN III activation. Aberrant regeneration of CN III is common after traumatic injury but may also occur with compressive lesions such as aneurysms or tumors. Microvascular ischemic CN III does not cause aberrant regeneration. </span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;20.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">The excitatory burst neurons for generating horizontal saccades are located in the paramedian pontine reticular formation. The medial longitudinal fasciculus contains neurons that project from the CN VI nucleus to the contralateral CN III nucleus and mediates horizontal yoke muscle movement. The rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal are located in the midbrain and are involved in the generation of torsional and vertical saccades.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;21.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">d. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Congenital ocular motor apraxia (as described by Cogan) is idiopathic and is characterized by increased latency and intermittent failure of horizontal saccadic initiation. Vertical eye movements are normal.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;22.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Divergence insufficiency (DI) is an acquired ocular misalignment defined by an esodeviation that is greater at distance than near fixation, without lateral incomitance, and without abduction deficits. This disorder is usually benign and not related to neurologic dysfunction. In older patients, DI often results from involution of the connective tissue band between the superior and lateral rectus muscles, causing inferior displacement of the lateral rectus muscles (ie, sagging eye syndrome). The malpositioned lateral rectus muscles have reduced abduction force, resulting in DI pattern esotropia. Rarely, DI may be caused by neurological disorders such as increased intracranial pressure, midbrain tumors, Miller Fisher syndrome, head trauma, intracranial hypotension, Arnold-Chiari malformation, and cerebellar degeneration (often with other signs of these disorders). A lesion in the CN VI nucleus results in a gaze palsy. A lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus results in an internuclear ophthalmoplegia characterized by impaired adduction and an abducting nystagmus during horizontal gaze opposite the side of the lesion. Enlarged medial rectus muscles that impair abduction are characteristic of thyroid-related orbitopathy.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;23.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> Downbeat nystagmus results from lesions that compromise the vestibulocerebellum (ie, </span><span class="CharOverride-12">the nodulus, uvula, flocculus, and paraflocculus of the cerebellum). Examples of other lo</span><span class="CharOverride-12">calizing forms of central vestibular nystagmus are upbeat nystagmus (medulla), Parinaud syndrome (dorsal midbrain), and see-saw nystagmus (parasellar region/diencephalon).</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;24.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> True infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS), or congenital nystagmus (CN), is not associated with afferent pathway disease and does not produce oscillopsia. In contrast, sensory nystagmus, which has a similar presentation, arises when central visual acuity is too poor </span><span class="CharOverride-12">to develop a stable fixational mechanism. It is associated with conditions that cause bi</span><span class="CharOverride-12">lateral, pregeniculate vision loss in children younger than 2 years. Therefore, workup of a patient with early-onset nystagmus should include a search for clinical manifestations of pregeniculate vision loss. In the absence of obvious ocular causes such as cataract, the patient should be evaluated for the following conditions, which may be subtle and difficult to detect in uncooperative children: optic neuropathy, foveal hypoplasia, and retinal dystrophy. Intracranial brain tumors do not cause INS. Poor fusion in a child causes fusion maldevelopment nystagmus. Chiasmal/suprachiasmal tumors such as optic pathway gliomas may result in a nystagmus identical to spasmus nutans.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;25.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> The presence of convergence-retraction nystagmus localizes the disease process to the dorsal midbrain; it is part of dorsal midbrain syndrome. Convergence-retraction nystagmus results from co-contraction of the extraocular muscles on attempted upgaze; the co-contraction of all extraocular muscles causes the globe to retract into the orbit. Dorsal midbrain syndrome also includes lid retraction, upgaze deficit, and pupillary light–near dissociation. Square-wave jerks, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, and ocular flutter are not components of dorsal midbrain syndrome.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;26.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome) produces an ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral impairment of pain and temperature sensation over the face (involvement of the descending tract of CN V), contralateral impairment of pain and temperature sensation over the trunk and limbs (involvement of the lateral spinal thalamic tract), ipsilateral cerebellar ataxia (damage to spinocerebellar tracts), and the ocular tilt reaction. In addition, patients with lateral medullary syndrome may have dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo, persistent hiccups, lateropulsion, and ocular lateropulsion. A cavernous sinus lesion, an internal carotid artery dissection, or a congenital brachial plexus injury might cause Horner syndrome, but they would not also cause the crossed impaired sensation of pain and temperature of the face and rest of the body.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;27.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> A patient with pharmacologic pupillary dilation will present with anisocoria that is </span><span class="CharOverride-12">greater in the light that does not respond to full strength pilocarpine (1% or more). My</span><span class="CharOverride-12">driasis due to Adie pupil or CN III palsy is overcome with installation of dilate or full-strength pilocarpine, respectively.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;28.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> Instilling apraclonidine in both eyes of a patient with Horner syndrome causes reversal of anisocoria due to the development of denervation supersensitivity of the α</span><span class="CharOverride-14">1</span><span class="CharOverride-12">-receptor, which makes the pupil dilator responsive to the weak α</span><span class="CharOverride-14">1</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> effect of apraclonidine. Hydroxyamphetamine is used to localize the Horner syndrome to either pre- or postganglionic. Brimonidine, which is a relatively pure α</span><span class="CharOverride-14">2</span><span class="CharOverride-12">-agonist, has no significant α</span><span class="CharOverride-14">1</span><span class="CharOverride-12">-adrenergic effect and therefore does not produce pupil dilation.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;29.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">a.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> Congenital Horner syndrome is most commonly caused by birth trauma to the brachial plexus. If there is no history of trauma, then the patient should have a workup for congenital tumors, such as neuroblastoma.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;30.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">a.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> Areflexia, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia characterize Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and facial diplegia often accompanies this classic triad. Herpes zoster involving CN VII is called Ramsay Hunt syndrome. It is diagnosed by the identification of vesicles along the posterior aspect of the external auditory canal. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome presents as recurrent unilateral or bilateral facial paralysis and is accompanied by chronic facial swelling. A cerebellopontine angle tumor may present with facial palsy, diplopia, hearing loss, and nystagmus.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;31.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Facial myokymia is usually the result of a pontine glioma or demyelination (ie, MS). It is characterized by continuous unilateral contraction of facial muscle bundles and typically signifies intramedullary disease of the pons involving the CN VII nucleus or fascicle. Compression of the CN VII root exit zone by an aberrant vessel is the most common cause of hemifacial spasm, which is characterized by a unilateral episodic spasm involving the facial musculature. Excessive caffeine intake may cause isolated eyelid myokymia. Aberrant regeneration after facial palsy is typically not continuous.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;32.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Orbital decompression will often alter or augment preexisting strabismus, so it should always precede strabismus surgery. Similarly, the strabismus surgery often alters the position of the eyelids, particularly the inferior eyelids. Eyelid surgery should be the last step.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;33.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">a. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Bilateral eyelid retraction (Collier sign) can be seen in patients with dorsal midbrain syndrome. Idiopathic levator fibrosis, Marcus Gunn jaw-winking syndrome, and spastic paretic facial contracture are associated with unilateral eyelid abnormalities.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;34.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Visual auras associated with migraines are usually hemianopic and often include positive visual phenomena. Visual aura typically lasts less than 60 minutes. The presence of a persistent hemianopic visual field defect may indicate that the symptoms are caused by an irritative mass lesion.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;35.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">d. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Primary trigeminal neuralgia is typically caused by vascular compression of CN V. It is almost always unilateral and usually involves the maxillary or mandibular distribution of CN V. Sensory function in the face should be normal on testing. Involvement of CN </span><span class="CharOverride-12">V</span><span class="CharOverride-14">1</span><span class="CharOverride-12">, bilateral symptoms, and facial numbness are more commonly seen in secondary trigeminal neuralgia; these symptoms raise the concern for an infiltrative or another pathological lesion.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;36.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Paroxysmal hemicrania is a form of trigeminal autonomic cephalgia associated with short bouts of pain highly responsive to indomethacin. Although cluster headache is also unilateral and frequently associated with autonomic features, the bouts of excruciating pain are of longer duration (15–180 minutes). Hemicrania continua is characterized by a continuous unilateral headache. Idiopathic stabbing headache manifests as episodic, very brief, sharp, jabbing pains, unassociated with autonomic features.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;37.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> The optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) drum test is perhaps the easiest test to perform and can help document the presence of some vision in patients who claim total bilateral blindness. In a patient with nonorganic blindness, some vision can also be confirmed via documentation of eye movements during the mirror test and abnormal responses to proprioceptive tests such as the finger-touching test. Because a relative afferent pupil defect can be absent in bilateral disease, it does not prove nonorganic vision loss.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;38.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">d. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Tunnel vision that does not expand on a tangent field at 1 and 2 meters is characteristic of nonorganic vision field loss. Furthermore, no other eye findings in this case support an organic pathology. Organic visual field loss should demonstrate a funnel of vision rather than tunnel vision (ie, the field expands as testing is executed at distances farther away from the patient).</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;39.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Voluntary flutter, sometimes misdiagnosed as nystagmus, is characterized by irregular, brief bursts of rapid frequency and low-amplitude eye movements with no slow phase. Voluntary flutter is usually seen in patients with nonorganic motility disturbances. End gaze nystagmus has a fast and slow phase; spasm of the near reflex is characterized by episodes of intermittent convergence, increased accommodation, and miosis. See-saw nystagmus is a form of disconjugate nystagmus in which 1 eye elevates and intorts and the other eye depresses and extorts, like a see-saw.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;40.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">a. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Patients who feign ptosis generally cannot simultaneously elevate the eye and maintain a drooping eyelid. Thus, with upward gaze, the ptosis will “resolve.” Looking down is not as effective for this purpose. Asking the patient to look down for a few seconds and then refixate straight ahead is a way to evaluate the patient for Cogan lid-twitch sign, which may be present in patients with myasthenia gravis. Asking a patient to make horizontal saccades and measure the palpebral fissures is used for the evaluation of aberrant regeneration or Duane retraction syndromes.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;41.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">c. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Altered mental status in the presence of a hemianopic visual field defect raises concern for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a condition associated with natalizumab in patients who are JC-virus positive. The other therapies have either not been associated or have only been associated with encephalopathy in rare cases. Fingolimod can cause macular edema.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;42.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">a. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Tuberous sclerosis is associated with intracranial calcified astrocytic hamartomas. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">Acoustic neuroma is the classic neuroimaging finding for neurofibromatosis type 2. Cerebellar hemangioblastoma is associated with von Hippel–Lindau disease. Leptomeningeal vascular malformation is a feature of Sturge-Weber syndrome (encephalofacial angiomatosis).</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;43.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">d.</span><span class="CharOverride-12"> Because this is the patient’s first demyelinating episode, she has a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Treatment with interferon β-1a, interferon β-1b, and glatiramer acetate has been shown to delay conversion to clinically definite MS in patients with CIS who have 2 or more white-matter lesions. Fingolimod, intravenous immunoglobulin, and natalizumab are not recommended for treatment of a patient with CIS.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;44.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">b. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">This vision loss is most consistent with bilateral optic neuritis. The bilateral nature of the vision loss, along with the severity of visual impairment and minimal recovery after treatment, raise a concern for neuromyelitis optica. It is uncommon for MS to present with bilateral optic neuritis with minimal recovery. Giant cell arteritis can cause bilateral severe vision loss associated with headache, but it does not affect young patients. Fingolimod has been associated with macular edema, which would cause blurred vision but not this degree of vision loss.</span></p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;45.&#9;<span class="CharOverride-11">d. </span><span class="CharOverride-12">The patient’s history and clinical findings are very concerning for an internal carotid artery dissection. Both MRI/MRA and computed tomography angiography (CTA) are used to detect a carotid dissection. CTA is often used in the acute setting because it is faster. CT of the brain and orbits would not be sensitive enough to detect a carotid dissection. Ultrasound is not adequate for detecting arterial dissection and can elicit a false-negative result in nearly one-third of cases.</span></p>
