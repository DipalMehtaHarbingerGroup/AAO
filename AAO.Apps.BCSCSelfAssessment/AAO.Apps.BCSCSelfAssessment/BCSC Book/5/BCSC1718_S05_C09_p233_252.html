			<div id="Chapt9_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A variety of diseases, drugs, or other factors may disrupt the systems that provide ocular stability. Abnormal eye movements may occur because of inability to maintain fixation, loss of the normal inhibitory influences on eye movement control, or loss of the normally symmetric input from one of the vestibular pathways to the ocular motor nuclei. <span class="italic">Nystagmus</span> refers to one form of excessive eye movements; this term should be reserved for rhythmic, to-and-fro (eg, horizontal, vertical, torsional, or mixed) eye movements that incorporate a slow phase. <span class="italic">Jerk nystagmus</span> has 2&#160;phases: (1)&#160;a slow-phase drift from the visual target, followed by (2)&#160;a corrective saccade (fast phase) back to the target. <span class="italic">Pendular nystagmus</span> describes back-and-forth, slow-phase movements that occur without a fast phase (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-1</span>). Abnormal saccadic movements may also drive the eyes off fixation. Collectively, these pathologic eye movements are termed <span class="italic">saccadic intrusions</span> or <span class="italic">saccadic oscillations;</span> because they have no slow phase, they do not conform to the definition of nystagmus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with acquired nystagmus often report <span class="italic">oscillopsia,</span> a sensation of environmental movement. Children with early-onset nystagmus typically do not have oscillopsia. Nystagmus in primary position may degrade visual acuity. Patients should be asked about any associated neurologic symptoms (eg, vertigo, ataxia, motor weakness, or sensory weakness) and any family history of abnormal eye movements or strabismus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An examination of ocular motility begins with an assessment of ocular stability in primary gaze. Any abnormal eye movements in the cardinal positions should be examined to determine whether they are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2">monocular or binocular</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">conjugate (ie, the eyes behave similarly)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">horizontal, vertical, torsional, or mixed in pattern</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">continuous or induced by a particular eye position</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">characterized by slow phases only (ie, pendular nystagmus), fast and slow phases (ie, jerk nystagmus), or fast phases only (ie, saccadic intrusion)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">reduced at a null point (ie, the field of gaze at which the nystagmus is minimal)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">By convention, the direction of jerk nystagmus is reported as the direction of its fast-phase component; however, it is the slow-phase component that indicates the pathology. <span class="italic">Dissociated</span> or <span class="italic">disconjugate nystagmus</span> occurs when the amplitude of oscillations differs in each eye, whereas <span class="italic">disjunctive nystagmus</span> occurs when the direction of the oscillations differs between the 2&#160;eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The amplitude of nystagmus often changes with gaze position. A few beats of nystagmus are normally present at the extremes of horizontal gaze (beyond 45°), especially in older patients. This finding should not be considered pathologic unless the nystagmus is persistent, asymmetric (eg, present to the left but not the right), or accompanied by other features. Assessment for nystagmus can be complemented by strategies that search for subtler, smaller-&#173;amplitude eye movements. Illuminated Frenzel (high-&#173;magnification) goggles are extremely useful for detecting eye movements, but a 20.00&#160;diopter&#160;(D) lens, slit lamp, or direct ophthalmoscope can also be used to block the patient’s fixation and magnify abnormal eye movements. Ocular motor recordings (eg, via electro- or video-&#173;oculography, infrared tracking, or electromagnetic scleral search-&#173;coil techniques) provide objective and highly sensitive measurements of eye movements but are often unavailable in standard clinical practice. The characteristics of eye movements can be recorded and communicated effectively via drawings and video recordings. Video recordings of many of the forms of nystagmus discussed in this chapter are available at <a href="http://novel.utah.edu">http://novel.utah.edu</a>.</p>

			<p class="h2">Infantile Nystagmus Syndrome (Congenital Nystagmus)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS), or congenital nystagmus (CN), is often recognized in the first few months of life but may not become evident until several years of age. There may be a family history of the disorder.</p>
			<p class="body-text">INS is almost always conjugate and horizontal, even in upgaze and downgaze. The nystagmus may be continuous or intermittent and can appear as jerk or pendular movements in different positions of gaze. Eye movement recordings show that these movements are often punctuated by <span class="italic">foveation periods</span> (brief periods in which the eyes are still and aimed at the object of regard). There is frequently a <span class="italic">null point,</span> the field of gaze in which nystagmus intensity is minimal and vision during the foveation period is maximized. If the null point is not in primary position, patients often adopt a head turn or posture that places the eyes in the null position in order to improve vision. Visual attention and fixation usually amplify INS (in contrast to peripheral vestibular nystagmus, discussed later in this chapter), whereas convergence on a near target damps the amplitude of the nystagmus. INS is abolished during sleep.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There are 2&#160;characteristic signs of INS:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-5">1.&#9;Reversal of the normal pattern of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN). Patients with INS respond to OKN drum rotation with slow-phase eye movements in the direction opposite to that of the rotating OKN drum.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-6">2.&#9;A unique pattern in which the velocity of the slow-phase movement increases exponentially with distance from fixation. This increasing-&#173;velocity waveform is punctuated by foveation periods. Determining this pattern requires analysis of eye movement recordings (see Fig&#160;9-1).</p>
			<p class="body-text">As mentioned previously, children with INS usually do not have oscillopsia. Visual acuity is determined by the length of the foveation period as well as the accompanying afferent pathway disease, if present. Visual acuity is often reduced, although some patients achieve normal visual acuity. Strabismus occurs in approximately 30% of patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">INS is associated with conditions that cause bilateral, pregeniculate vision loss prior to 2&#160;years of age. Therefore, the workup of a patient with early-&#173;onset nystagmus should include a search for clinical manifestations of pregeniculate vision loss. In some patients, the etiology may be obvious, such as in children with bilateral, dense, congenital cataracts. However, if the patient’s eyes do not have an obvious structural abnormality, the patient should be evaluated for the following conditions, which may be subtle and difficult to detect in uncooperative children:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2"><span class="italic">Optic neuropathy.</span> INS occurs with bilateral optic neuropathies that occur prior to 2&#160;years of age, most commonly optic nerve hypoplasia. The clinician should consider obtaining neuroimaging to detect hydrocephalus or a compressive lesion. The detection of optic nerve hypoplasia requires an endocrinologic evaluation for associated hypopituitarism.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Foveal hypoplasia.</span> INS occurs with foveal hypoplasia, often in patients with albinism or aniridia. Patients should be assessed for other signs of albinism, such as iris transillumination defects and hypopigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium, choroid, skin, and hair. Albinism and aniridia may be familial.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3"><span class="italic">Retinal dystrophy.</span> INS may occur with early-&#173;onset retinal dystrophies such as achromatopsia and Leber congenital amaurosis. Patients should be assessed for other signs of retinal dystrophy, such as photophobia, eye pressing, paradoxical pupils, and high refractive error. Retinal examination may show mild pallor of the optic nerve head and vessel attenuation, or may be normal. The clinician should determine whether the patient has a familial history of retinal dystrophies. Ultimately, electrophysiologic testing (eg, electroretinogram) is required for diagnosis. Children with regression of developmental milestones require further workup for neurometabolic disease.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 40% of children with typical INS will have no detectable afferent pathway abnormality despite an extensive workup including electrophysiologic testing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Memantine or gabapentin may reduce the severity of nystagmus and improve visual function in some patients with INS. However, these medications have adverse effects and are not commonly used for childhood nystagmus. The use of base-out prisms to induce convergence may help those patients whose nystagmus damps with convergence. Contact lenses may improve visual function in patients with INS. Some patients with INS can be treated with extraocular muscle surgery (eg, the Anderson-&#173;Kestenbaum procedure) to mechanically shift the null point closer to primary position (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-2</span>; see also Fig&#160;13-3&#160;in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>). A similar procedure may be performed on the vertical recti of a patient with a vertical null point, although diplopia may occur postoperatively because of limited vertical fusional amplitudes. In certain patients, horizontal rectus muscle tenotomy and reattachment of these muscles to their original insertion site may induce a variable reduction in nystagmus amplitude and improve visual function.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Fusional Maldevelopment Nystagmus Syndrome (Latent Nystagmus)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fusional maldevelopment nystagmus (FMN) syndrome, or latent nystagmus (LN), is an early-&#173;onset, conjugate, horizontal, jerk nystagmus that is accentuated by monocular fixation. Eyes with FMN are stable during fusion. However, when 1&#160;eye is occluded (thereby eliminating fusion), the fixating eye slowly drifts toward the nose, followed by a corrective abducting saccade. The eye under the occluder is moving in the same direction and with the same amplitude as the fixating eye (ie, the nystagmus is conjugate). Thus, the fast phase of both eyes beats toward the viewing eye and away from the occluded eye. The fast phase immediately reverses direction upon occlusion of the fixating eye as the fellow eye takes up fixation. Therefore, when a standard occluder is used to measure visual acuity in patients with FMN, acuity is often degraded by the induced nystagmus. Partial optical blurring of 1&#160;eye (with a high-plus lens or filter) may not induce FMN and therefore may permit better visual acuity measurements in the fellow eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">FMN may occur when both eyes are open if 1&#160;eye is suppressed, a condition termed <span class="italic">manifest latent nystagmus (MLN).</span> In other words, the nystagmus is damped with fusion but develops spontaneously whenever suppression occurs; the clinician may not need to occlude an eye to induce this form of nystagmus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">FMN occurs with any condition that disrupts binocular development in the first 6&#160;months of life, most commonly infantile esotropia. Other associated conditions include severe anisometropia, constant infantile exotropia, monocular cataract, corneal opacities, and unilateral microphthalmos. If 1&#160;eye has severe structural damage with poor vision (such as unilateral microphthalmos), then the fellow eye with normal vision will always be the fixating eye and the FMN will always beat toward that eye (because the abnormal eye with poor vision is unable to take up fixation). Patients may maintain a head turn toward the fixating eye. This head posture places the fixating eye in adduction, thereby damping the nystagmus in order to improve vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with FMN often have other associated signs of abnormal binocular development, such as dissociated vertical deviation, oblique overaction, and smooth pursuit asymmetry (in which the fixating eye is able to pursue a target moving toward the nose but has difficulty pursuing a target moving away from the nose).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Eye movement recordings show that FMN usually has a constant-&#173;velocity or decelerating slow phase, in contrast to the increasing exponential waveform of INS. FMN and INS may coexist.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Heimann-Bielschowsky Phenomenon</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Monocular nystagmus in an eye with long-&#173;standing poor vision is often referred to as the Heimann-&#173;Bielschowsky phenomenon. This phenomenon may occur in patients with poor vision from a variety of underlying etiologies, including optic neuropathy and amblyopia. Onset may occur in adulthood with highly asymmetric vision loss and may not remit even if the visual problem (eg, dense cataract) is corrected. The nystagmus is characterized by intermittent, monocular, vertical, slow, pendular eye movements of low frequency and variable amplitude. Workup is directed toward determining the etiology of the visual loss. The etiology may be obvious on ophthalmologic examination, requiring no additional diagnostic testing (eg, in an infant with unilateral microphthalmos). However, monocular vertical nystagmus in an infant with a relative afferent pupillary defect and optic nerve head atrophy suggests an optic nerve or chiasmal tumor (glioma) and therefore warrants neuroimaging. Symptomatic oscillopsia is uncommon and can be treated with gabapentin. Strabismus surgery can improve appearance.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Spasmus Nutans Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Spasmus nutans syndrome is a childhood nystagmus characterized by asymmetric, small-&#173;amplitude, high-&#173;frequency, “shimmering” eye movements, often accompanied by head nodding and an abnormal head posture <span class="italic">(torticollis).</span> The nystagmus may be dissociated (sometimes even monocular), and the amplitude and phase relationships of the eye movements may vary between the eyes over the course of a few seconds. The shimmering eye movements are often variable or intermittent; may occur in the horizontal, vertical, or oblique plane; and may increase in the abducted eye during lateral gaze. Head nodding, torticollis, or both occur in approximately 60% of patients and appear to damp the nystagmus and improve vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Spasmus nutans syndrome is typically acquired in the first year of life and spontaneously improves 2–8&#160;years later. Secondary amblyopia and strabismus may occur in the more involved eye. The syndrome is sometimes familial and is associated with African American ethnicity, Hispanic ethnicity, and low socioeconomic status.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, spasmus nutans syndrome is distinguished from INS by the asymmetric or monocular, high-&#173;frequency, small-&#173;amplitude, shimmering, multiplanar, variable nature of the nystagmus. In contrast, INS consists of larger amplitude, lower frequency, bilateral, conjugate, symmetric, horizontal, constant ocular movements.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The etiology of spasmus nutans syndrome is unknown. Chiasmal/suprachiasmal tumors (eg, optic pathway gliomas), retinal dystrophies (eg, congenital stationary night blindness), and neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Pelizaeus-&#173;Merzbacher disease or Leigh disease) may result in an identical nystagmus. Therefore, neuroimaging is indicated for patients with presumed spasmus nutans syndrome to exclude a glioma of the anterior visual pathway or other parasellar or hypothalamic tumors. An electroretinogram should be obtained if the patient shows signs of a retinal dystrophy (eg, progressive visual loss, photophobia, nyctalopia, eye pressing, paradoxical pupils, or high refractive error). Progressive developmental delay requires an evaluation for neurodegenerative disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with spasmus nutans syndrome should be monitored and treated for any associated amblyopia and strabismus. As noted earlier, the abnormal eye and head movements typically disappear after several years (usually by the end of the first decade of life). Lack of resolution or development of other neurologic problems should prompt appropriate evaluation, including neuroimaging.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-12">Gaze-Evoked Nystagmus</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Gaze-evoked nystagmus develops because of an inability to maintain fixation in eccentric gaze. The eyes drift back to the midline as a result of the elastic properties of the orbit, and a corrective saccade is generated to reposition the eyes on the eccentric target. Therefore, the fast phase is always in the direction of gaze. The amplitude of the nystagmus increases as the eyes are moved in the direction of the fast phase. This pattern is in accordance with Alexander’s law, which states that nystagmus increases in intensity (amplitude and frequency) as the eyes are moved in the direction of the fast phase.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Gaze-evoked nystagmus is most commonly caused by dysfunction of the <span class="italic">neural integrator</span> (see Chapters&#160;1 and 8). For horizontal gaze, the neural integrator includes the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and the medial vestibular nuclei. For vertical gaze, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal serves as the neural integrator. The cerebellum also participates in neural integration of both horizontal and vertical eye movements.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When eccentric gaze is initiated, the neural integrator receives a velocity signal (the <span class="italic">pulse</span>) from the appropriate gaze center and, through the mathematical process of integration, generates tonic innervation (a <span class="italic">step</span> signal) to maintain the eccentric position of the eyes after the ocular movements have been completed (see Chapter&#160;8, Fig&#160;8-2). Thus, the neural integrator ensures a level of neural activity adequate to maintain the eyes in an eccentric position of gaze against the elastic forces of the orbit. If the neural integrator fails to function properly (ie, becomes “leaky”), then the tonic innervation (step signal) that holds the eyes in eccentric gaze is deficient. Therefore, after completion of eccentric gaze, the eyes slowly drift off the target back to the central position, followed by a corrective saccade toward the target—hence the term <span class="italic">gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Pathologic gaze-evoked nystagmus is caused by dysfunction of the structures in the brainstem and cerebellum that participate in neural integration. A few beats of symmetric, low-&#173;frequency, small-&#173;amplitude jerk nystagmus at the extremes of far horizontal gaze without other ocular motility dysfunction (eg, rebound nystagmus or saccadic dysmetria) constitute physiologic endpoint nystagmus and are not clinically significant. However, sustained, large-&#173;amplitude, or asymmetric gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus is pathologic and should prompt further evaluation. The 2&#160;most common etiologies are (1)&#160;toxic effects from drugs and medications (eg, alcohol, sedatives, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants) and (2)&#160;cerebellar disease. Whenever gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus is asymmetric, an ipsilateral lesion of the brainstem or cerebellum—typically stroke, demyelination, or tumor—is presumably present. Such a finding should prompt appropriate patient evaluation, including targeted neuroimaging. End-&#173;organ disease, such as extraocular myopathies and myasthenia gravis, can also cause gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus, with a pattern similar to that observed with lesions of the central nervous system.</p>
			<p class="h2">Rebound Nystagmus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In some patients with gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus, prolonged eccentric gaze (&gt;30&#160;seconds) reduces the amplitude of the nystagmus. However, when the patient resumes central gaze position, a jerk nystagmus develops in the opposite direction of the initial gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus, a condition referred to as <span class="italic">rebound nystagmus.</span> Prolonged eccentric viewing likely induces brainstem/cerebellar compensatory mechanisms that gradually increase tonic innervation toward eccentric gaze, thereby reducing the gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus. When the patient resumes central gaze, residual tonic innervation continues to drive the eyes toward the prior eccentric gaze position, followed by a corrective saccade in the opposite direction (rebound nystagmus). For example, a patient with gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus may have a gradual reduction of the amplitude of a rightward-&#173;beating nystagmus with prolonged right gaze because brainstem/cerebellar compensatory mechanisms gradually increase tonic right-gaze innervation. However, upon resuming central gaze, the residual tonic right-gaze innervation continues, inducing a slow-phase ocular rotation toward the right, followed by a corrective, leftward-&#173;beating saccade (ie, rightward-&#173;beating gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus in right gaze followed by leftward-&#173;beating rebound nystagmus upon resuming central gaze). Gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus accompanied by rebound nystagmus is often a manifestation of cerebellar disease.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-13">Vestibular Nystagmus</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Peripheral Vestibular Nystagmus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with peripheral vestibular nystagmus typically present with a sudden, sometimes dramatic, onset of disequilibrium with vertigo, nausea, and vomiting (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;9-1</span>). Patients often recognize that their symptoms are worsened by particular head movements or postures. Oscillopsia, tinnitus, and hearing loss may also occur. After the acute phase of peripheral vestibular loss, which typically lasts days, patients experience a slow period (lasting weeks to months) of gradually waning symptoms. Even patients who become asymptomatic may experience discomfort months to years later when their vestibular system is challenged, for example when riding in a fast-&#173;moving car or boat.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Peripheral vestibular nystagmus results from dysfunction of the end organs (eg, semicircular canals, otolithic structures, or vestibular nerve). End-&#173;organ damage is usually unilateral or asymmetric (except in cases of toxicity) and disrupts the normally symmetric vestibular afferent input to the ocular motor nuclei. Asymmetric afferent input from the semicircular canals generates vestibular nystagmus. The characteristics of peripheral vestibular nystagmus reflect the combined effects of decreased afferent input from all 3&#160;semicircular canals.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Input from the horizontal semicircular canal is routed to the contralateral abducens nucleus (see Chapters&#160;1 and&#160;8). Therefore, stimulating the horizontal canal generates contralateral horizontal gaze. Conversely, a lesion of the horizontal canal results in ipsilateral gaze. Therefore, a lesion of the horizontal canal results in a tonic gaze deviation toward the side of the lesion, followed by a corrective saccade away from the side of the lesion (ie, nystagmus beats away from the lesion). For example, a left-sided vestibular lesion reduces input from the left horizontal semicircular canal, resulting in a leftward tonic gaze deviation, followed by a corrective saccade away from the side of the lesion. Thus, a left-sided lesion would produce leftward slow phases and right jerk nystagmus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The anterior semicircular canals generate upgaze, and the posterior semicircular canals generate downgaze. Therefore, a unilateral vestibular lesion that affects the anterior and posterior canals on one side has no net effect on vertical gaze. However, the anterior and posterior canals generate contralateral torsion. Therefore, a unilateral vestibular lesion causes tonic ipsilateral torsion, followed by a corrective torsional saccade away from the side of the lesion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Combining the effects of decreased afferent input from all 3&#160;semicircular canals on 1&#160;side, a unilateral peripheral vestibular lesion generates a combined horizontal–torsional nystagmus with jerk phases directed away from the side of the lesion. The nystagmus follows Alexander’s law, which states that the nystagmus is more pronounced when gaze is directed toward the side of the fast-&#173;beating component. Depending on the severity of the lesion, the nystagmus may be evident in primary position. Asymmetric otolithic input may result in a skew deviation or an ocular tilt reaction (see Chapter&#160;8).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A characteristic feature of peripheral vestibular nystagmus is the ability of visual fixation to damp the nystagmus. The clinician can evaluate the effect of visual fixation on nystagmus during direct ophthalmoscopy by temporarily covering the contralateral fixating eye. Other methods for enhancing vestibular nystagmus include vigorous head shaking, hyperventilation, mastoid vibration, and the Valsalva maneuver.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Peripheral vestibular dysfunction, often accompanied by nystagmus, usually occurs in 1 of 4&#160;clinical patterns:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-7">&#9;1.&#9;Acute monophasic disorder secondary to a (presumed viral) vestibular neuronitis.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;2.&#9;Recurrent vestibular dysfunction, usually associated with auditory symptoms (eg, tinnitus and hearing loss). This disorder, exemplified by <span class="italic">Ménière disease,</span> is usually progressive, although there may be long symptom-&#173;free intervals.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;3.&#9;Paroxysmal dysfunction of the vestibular system that produces vertigo in response to certain postures of the head. This disorder, known as <span class="italic">benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV),</span> develops because of free movement of otoconia particles (calcium carbonate crystals normally contained within the utricle and saccule), which act as foreign debris within a semicircular canal. The Dix-&#173;Hallpike maneuver, during which the patient’s head is turned 45° to the right or left and lowered below the horizontal plane of an examining table to induce symptoms, can be used to determine on which side the semicircular canals are dysfunctional. Once the side is identified, repositioning treatments such as the Epley maneuver can remove the otoconia from that semicircular canal and provide lasting remission, although recurrence is not unusual.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">&#9;4.&#9;Toxic vestibular dysfunction, primarily caused by the use of aminoglycosides (but also other medications such as chemotherapeutics). Systemic ototoxins typically produce head movement–related oscillopsia and decreased vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) gain bilaterally with little or no nystagmus (ie, vestibular hypofunction without asymmetry).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A very large cerebellopontine angle tumor (eg, vestibular schwannoma or meningioma) may produce <span class="italic">Bruns nystagmus,</span> which is a combination of gaze-&#173;evoked and peripheral vestibular nystagmus. Initially, because the vestibular nerve is affected, the eyes drift toward the side of the lesion, with a corrective fast phase in the opposite direction. As the lesion enlarges, the ipsilateral brainstem is compressed, causing problems in maintaining ipsilateral eccentric gaze; thus, as the patient looks to the side of the lesion, a large-&#173;amplitude, low-&#173;frequency, ipsilesional gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus is noted, whereas in contralateral gaze (away from the side of the lesion), a small-&#173;amplitude, high-&#173;frequency, contralesional vestibular nystagmus is observed.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Central Forms of Vestibular Nystagmus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Because the central vestibular structures of the brainstem and the cerebellum are extensively interconnected, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to determine the precise location of lesions that produce central nystagmus by clinical examination alone. Although some forms of central vestibular nystagmus provide localizing information (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;9-2</span>), it is often more useful to think of the central vestibular pathways as a single system and to obtain neuroimaging if more specific information about localization is desired. Central vestibular nystagmus often involves pathways governed by the anterior semicircular canals, posterior semicircular canals, or both. Therefore, isolated vertical or torsional nystagmus is common (in contrast to peripheral vestibular nystagmus, which is characterized by horizontal movements combined with torsional movements). If central vestibular nystagmus is of small amplitude and present only outside primary position, patients may have no visual symptoms.</p>
			<p class="h3">Downbeat nystagmus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Downbeat nystagmus is the most common form of central vestibular nystagmus and results from lesions that produce defective vertical gaze holding characterized by an upward drift of the eyes, which is then corrected with a downward saccade. Lesions that cause downbeat nystagmus compromise the vestibulocerebellum (ie, the nodulus, uvula, flocculus, and paraflocculus) and diminish the tonic output from the posterior semicircular canals to the ocular motor neurons. Downbeat nystagmus may be present in primary position, but in accordance with Alexander’s law, the downbeating movements are usually accentuated in downgaze (especially to either side). Patients usually report oscillopsia, which can be debilitating.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A structural lesion may be associated with downbeat nystagmus, in which case the lesion is often located at the cervicomedullary junction. The most common structural lesion is an Arnold-&#173;Chiari type&#160;I malformation, a developmental abnormality characterized by posterior fossa crowding and cerebellar tonsillar protrusion into the foramen magnum (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-3</span>). Lesions at the foramen magnum are best assessed with sagittal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In some cases of unexplained downbeat nystagmus, antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) have been identified in the blood of affected patients. These antibodies might produce downbeat nystagmus by interfering with the <span class="greek--tx-">c</span>-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-&#173;ergic neurons of the vestibular complex that normally inhibit the cells of the flocculus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of downbeat nystagmus includes the following:</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Common off-&#173;label treatments (treatments prescribed for an indication other than those that have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration) for downbeat nystagmus and other central vestibular forms of nystagmus include clonazepam (a GABA receptor agonist), baclofen, gabapentin, memantine, 4-aminopyridine, and &#173;3,4-diaminopyridine (amifampridine). Unfortunately, medical treatment often provides little to no improvement of symptoms. Dalfampridine has been used to treat downbeat nystagmus and may be more efficacious than the similar drug 3,4-diaminopyridine. Base-out prisms (used to induce convergence) can sometimes improve the oscillopsia associated with downbeat nystagmus.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-16">Upbeat nystagmus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Upbeat nystagmus is characterized by a downward drifting of the eyes, followed by corrective, upward saccades. Upbeat nystagmus may be caused by lesions in the brainstem (often medulla) or the anterior cerebellar vermis; thus, the lesions may exist at various locations within the posterior fossa. Common causes of upbeat nystagmus include demyelination, stroke, cerebellar degeneration, and tobacco smoking.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-16">Torsional nystagmus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although peripheral vestibular nystagmus may have a torsional component, purely torsional nystagmus indicates a central lesion. <span class="italic">Torsional nystagmus</span> is usually associated with a medullary lesion (eg, syringobulbia, lateral medullary infarction) and may be part of an ocular tilt reaction (see Chapter&#160;8).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-16">Periodic alternating nystagmus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN) is a strictly horizontal nystagmus that oscillates predictably in direction, amplitude, and frequency. For instance, a rightward-&#173;beating nystagmus develops progressively larger amplitudes and higher frequencies up to a certain point, then wanes, eventually leading to a short period of downbeat or no nystagmus. Then the nystagmus reverses direction, with a crescendo–decrescendo pattern that again leads to a short period without nystagmus, completing the cycle. PAN may be congenital or acquired. The acquired form has a characteristic oscillation cycle of 2–4&#160;minutes. A cursory examination may lead to the erroneous conclusion that the nystagmus is directed toward one side only. For this reason, any presentation of nystagmus that is purely horizontal and occurs in primary position should be observed for at least 2&#160;minutes to be certain that the condition is not PAN. A patient with PAN may also demonstrate a periodic alternating head turn (in the direction of the nystagmus) to minimize the nystagmus, in accordance with Alexander’s law.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Acquired PAN is caused by unstable “velocity storage,” typically secondary to vestibulocerebellar disease. As discussed in Chapter&#160;8, the vestibular-&#173;ocular system’s response to sustained head rotation attenuates fairly quickly as the cilia on the hair cells resume their normal position. However, a velocity storage mechanism prolongs the vestibular-&#173;ocular response for several seconds during sustained head movements. This velocity storage mechanism is generated by interconnections within the vestibular nuclei (the vestibular commissure) and is stabilized by cerebellar GABA-&#173;ergic innervation. Cerebellar disease may cause unstable velocity storage that results in a horizontal nystagmus with an oscillating null point, namely PAN. Common causes include Arnold-&#173;Chiari type&#160;I malformation, cerebellar degeneration, multiple sclerosis (MS), cerebellar tumors, stroke, use of anticonvulsant medication, and bilateral loss of vision. If the bilateral vision loss is reversed (eg, if a vitreous hemorrhage is cleared), PAN may be abolished. Baclofen, a GABA receptor agonist, can abolish the acquired form of PAN.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-17">Acquired Pendular Nystagmus</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acquired pendular nystagmus includes pendular, slow-phase eye movements in the horizontal, vertical, and torsional planes (often forming elliptical waveforms). In contrast, congenital pendular nystagmus usually manifests with only horizontal movements. Pendular nystagmus with both vertical and horizontal components produces oblique nystagmus (if the components are in phase) or circular or elliptical nystagmus (if the components are out of phase). The eye movements may be conjugate or disconjugate and are often dissociated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The localizing value of acquired pendular nystagmus is poor. It is most commonly observed in patients with MS, who may exhibit asymmetric or monocular forms. This form of nystagmus can also develop after blindness occurs secondary to optic nerve disease, including optic neuropathy due to MS. When vision is reduced in both eyes, the nystagmus is typically larger in the eye with poorer vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Memantine or gabapentin may reduce the severity of nystagmus and improve vision in patients with acquired pendular nystagmus. Unilateral retrobulbar injection of botulinum toxin type&#160;A reduces the amplitude of nystagmus and may improve vision for patients who are willing to view monocularly. However, total cessation of eye movements has its own consequences; for example, some patients report blurred vision when walking because of the loss of the normal VOR that adjusts eye position as the head moves.</p>

			<p class="h2">Oculopalatal Myoclonus or Tremor</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acquired pendular nystagmus may accompany <span class="italic">palatal myoclonus,</span> an acquired oscillation of the palate. The eye movements are continuous and rhythmic, occur at a frequency of approximately 1&#160;Hz, typically conjugate in the vertical plane, and persist during sleep. This eye movement disorder may also be associated with synchronous movements of the facial muscles, pharynx, tongue, larynx, diaphragm, trunk, and extremities. The condition usually arises several months (up to years in rare cases) after a lesion occurs that involves the Guillain-&#173;Mollaret triangle—a region that encompasses pathways that travel between the red nucleus, the inferior olivary nucleus, and the contralateral cerebellar nuclei. Lesions of this pathway produce inferior olivary hypertrophy, which is visualized with MRI as a T2&#160;hyperintensity within 1&#160;or both inferior olives.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-17">See-Saw Nystagmus</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See-saw nystagmus is a form of disjunctive nystagmus in which 1&#160;eye elevates and intorts while the other eye depresses and extorts, a movement reminiscent of that of a see-saw. The eye movements are typically pendular, slow in frequency, and similar in amplitude between eyes. See-saw nystagmus may be congenital or acquired and may be caused by lesions that affect the chiasm, midbrain, or both. Trauma and parasellar-&#173;diencephalic tumors, in particular craniopharyngioma, are frequent causes; hydrocephalus and congenital achiasma are rare causes. There may be associated vision loss, often a bitemporal hemianopia. See-saw nystagmus may also occur in patients with vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa, albinism, or optic nerve hypoplasia. Asymmetric vision loss may influence the amplitude of the eye movements (ie, the amplitude may be larger in the eye with poorer vision).</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-17">Dissociated Nystagmus With Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lesions of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) produce an <span class="italic">internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO)</span> (see Chapter&#160;7). Isolated slowing of adduction of the eye ipsilateral to an MLF lesion is the primary feature required to establish a diagnosis of INO. In addition, nystagmus of the abducting eye often occurs when gaze is directed to the side opposite the lesion. One explanation for this pattern of dissociated nystagmus is the development of increased neural pulsing in an attempt to overcome the adduction weakness. According to Hering’s law, the increased neural signaling is also delivered to the contralateral yoke muscle, causing excessive saccadic movements in the contralateral lateral rectus muscle.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-17">Saccadic Intrusions</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eye movement recordings have helped identify several forms of saccadic intrusions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-4)</span>. Two classes of saccadic intrusions are distinguished by either the presence or the absence of an intersaccadic interval—the temporal separation between sequential saccades that lasts 180–200&#160;milliseconds.</p>
			<p class="h2">Saccadic Intrusions With Normal Intersaccadic Intervals</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common saccadic intrusions are <span class="italic">square-wave jerks,</span> which have a normal intersaccadic interval (amplitude, typically &lt;2°; latency to refixation, 200&#160;ms) and may occur normally at low frequencies (4–6 per minute) in older patients. Pathologic square-wave jerks occur at a rate greater than 15 per minute. <span class="italic">Macrosquare-wave jerks</span> are much less common but also include an intersaccadic interval (amplitude, 5°–15°; latency to refixation, 70–150&#160;ms). The larger-&#173;amplitude macrosquare-&#173;wave jerks tend to have a slightly higher frequency and are always pathologic. They are observed most frequently in patients with cerebellar disease or MS. Lesions of the cerebellum, brainstem, or their interconnecting fibers may alter the discharge of omnipause cells in the pons and burst cells in the paramedian pontine reticular formation (for horizontal saccades) (see Chapter&#160;8). The inhibition of omnipause cells and the stimulation of burst cells lower the threshold for saccadic initiation, resulting in inappropriate saccadic intrusions that drive the eyes off of fixation.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Macrosaccadic oscillation</span> is another saccadic intrusion that breaks fixation. Macrosaccadic oscillations differ from square-wave jerks in that they consist of large saccades that straddle and overshoot fixation without foveation of the target. The saccades are separated by an intersaccadic interval. The oscillations occur in bursts in which the saccadic amplitude increases and then decreases; eye movement recordings show a characteristic spindle shape. Macrosaccadic oscillations occur from cerebellar lesions (eg, tumors, MS, stroke, paraneoplastic syndromes) that alter the calibration of saccadic size, resulting in hypermetric primary and corrective saccades that oscillate around the desired eye position.</p>
			<p class="h2">Saccadic Intrusions Without Normal Intersaccadic Intervals</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Two types of eye movement abnormalities lack the intersaccadic interval that normally occurs between sequential saccades: (1)&#160;ocular flutter and (2)&#160;opsoclonus. <span class="italic">Ocular flutter</span> is characterized by bursts of involuntary, small-&#173;amplitude, very high-&#173;frequency (10–15&#160;Hz) <span class="italic">horizontal</span> eye movements (see Fig&#160;9-4D). <span class="italic">Opsoclonus</span> (also known as <span class="italic">saccadomania</span>), however, consists of involuntary, <span class="italic">multidirectional</span> eye movements with a similarly high frequency but often larger amplitude. A patient may have ocular flutter and opsoclonus during the course of a disease. Both conditions can occur with myoclonus and ataxia (dancing eyes and feet syndrome). Ocular flutter and opsoclonus can be diagnosed with reasonable confidence through clinical examination, although a definitive demonstration of the lack of an intersaccadic interval requires eye movement recordings. The pathophysiology is unknown but may relate to cerebellar/brainstem dysfunction that inhibits omnipause neurons (located in the pons) and activates burst neurons (located in the paramedian pontine reticular formation and rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus), resulting in uncontrolled, involuntary horizontal and vertical saccadic intrusions (see Chapter&#160;8).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Etiologies of ocular flutter and opsoclonus include paraneoplastic syndromes, encephalitis, drug intoxication, MS, environmental toxins, and hyperosmolar coma. Ocular flutter and opsoclonus may also occur in some patients without explanation in the absence of associated systemic abnormalities. Opsoclonus may be a transient finding that resolves by 6&#160;months of age in otherwise-&#173;healthy infants.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnostic workup for ocular flutter and opsoclonus includes searching for a tumor and an associated paraneoplastic syndrome. In children, neuroblastoma (or another tumor of neural crest origin) is the primary consideration, whereas in adults, small-cell carcinoma of the lung or cancer of the breast or ovaries is of prime concern. Evaluation consists of a complete physical examination and may include MRI or computed tomography (CT) of the head, chest, and abdomen; a whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan; lumbar puncture; and a test of urine catecholamine levels (to detect elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid, associated with neuroblastoma). Abnormal paraneoplastic antibodies may be found in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid of some patients with paraneoplastic syndrome–induced ocular flutter/opsoclonus. A serologic or cerebrospinal fluid assay for the immunoglobulin G anti–neuronal nuclear antibody type&#160;2 (ANNA-2, or anti-Ri) can help confirm the diagnosis in cases that are secondary to cancer of the breast or ovary, whereas anti–neuronal nuclear antibody type&#160;1 (ANNA-1, or anti-Hu) is present in some children with neuroblastoma. However, many patients with paraneoplastic syndromes do not have detectable anti–neuronal nuclear antibodies. Therefore, the absence of these antibodies does not exclude a paraneoplastic syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of ocular flutter and opsoclonus is directed at the underlying etiology. Regardless of etiology, immunomodulation with corticosteroids, plasmapharesis, intravenous immunoglobulin, or azathioprine may reduce the saccadic oscillations and associated oscillopsia. Other medications that may reduce symptoms include propranolol, verapamil, gabapentin, and thiamine.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Voluntary Flutter (Voluntary “Nystagmus”)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Voluntary “nystagmus” consists of rapidly oscillating eye movements (almost always horizontal) that can be induced volitionally. These movements, which are not a form of nystagmus (because they lack slow phases), appear as high-&#173;frequency, conjugate, back-to-back saccades without an intersaccadic interval. They are associated with convergence, facial grimacing, and eyelid fluttering. Episodes are unsustained, rarely lasting longer than 30&#160;seconds. Voluntary nystagmus occurs in 8% of the normal population, may be familial, and is not associated with other neurological findings. At times, voluntary nystagmus can be difficult to distinguish from ocular flutter. Unlike voluntary nystagmus, ocular flutter may be sustained; is typically associated with other neurological signs (such as ocular dysmetria, ataxia, and myoclonus); and does not have the convergence, facial grimacing, and eyelid fluttering of voluntary nystagmus.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Additional Eye Movement Disorders</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top9">
			<p class="h2-h1">Convergence-Retraction Nystagmus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Convergence-&#173;retraction nystagmus does not meet the true definition of nystagmus because it lacks slow phases. This condition results from co-&#173;contraction of the extraocular muscles on attempted upgaze. The medial rectus muscles are the most powerful of the extraocular muscles, and their contraction produces convergent movements even when all other extraocular muscles are contracting. The co-&#173;contraction of all extraocular muscles causes retraction of the globe into the orbit. Convergence-&#173;retraction nystagmus localizes the disease process to the dorsal midbrain and is part of <span class="italic">dorsal midbrain syndrome</span> (see Chapter&#160;8, Fig&#160;8-5); therefore, this “nystagmus” is often associated with paresis of upgaze, pupillary light–near dissociation, skew deviation, and bilateral eyelid retraction (Collier sign). Convergence-&#173;retraction nystagmus is best demonstrated by having the patient attempt an upward saccade elicited on command or by following a downward-&#173;rotating OKN drum.</p>
			<p class="h2">Superior Oblique Myokymia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Superior oblique myokymia (SOM) is characterized by monocular, paroxysmal, high-&#173;frequency bursts of superior oblique muscle contraction. These bursts typically last for seconds, occur numerous times per day, and produce vertical and torsional eye movements. The movements are of very small amplitude and usually require magnification (obtained, for instance, with a slit lamp or 20.00&#160;D lens) to observe them. Using the slit lamp to focus on a conjunctival vessel can help identify these movements. The abnormal movements may occur either spontaneously or immediately after a downward eye movement or blinking. Patients may experience a combination of oscillopsia, vertical/torsional diplopia, blurry vision, and tremulous ocular sensations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The etiology of SOM is unknown. Some clinical and neuroimaging findings suggest that this disorder may occur when the superior cerebellar or posterior cerebral artery compresses the cranial nerve (CN)&#160;IV root exit zone, similar to the neurovascular compression that occurs with hemifacial spasm and trigeminal neuralgia. In rare cases, SOM may occur prior to or after a CN&#160;IV palsy. Thus, CN&#160;IV compression, aberrant regeneration, and ephaptic transmission are implicated in the pathophysiology of this disorder.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although most patients with SOM are otherwise healthy, in rare cases, SOM may be associated with MS, posterior fossa tumor, stroke, or trauma. Neuroimaging should be considered to identify any associated conditions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical course of SOM is variable. Some patients recover spontaneously or experience only brief spells of symptoms. Other patients experience chronic oscillopsia or intermittent diplopia. Treatment with <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers (topical or systemic), carbamazepine, phenytoin, baclofen, oxcarbazepine, or gabapentin may be helpful for some patients. A superior oblique tenectomy (to alleviate the oscillopsia) combined with an ipsilateral inferior oblique myectomy (to treat the iatrogenic superior oblique weakness) may help patients with more severe symptoms. In patients with neurovascular compression, intracranial surgery to decompress CN&#160;IV may alleviate symptoms. However, most patients choose a less invasive treatment option.</p>
