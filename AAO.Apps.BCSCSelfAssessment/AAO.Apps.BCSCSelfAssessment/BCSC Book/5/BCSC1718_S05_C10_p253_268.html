			<p class="chapter-title">The Patient With Pupillary Abnormalities</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pupillary function is an important objective clinical sign in the assessment of patients with vision loss and neurologic disease. A relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) localizes the site of damage to the retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, or optic tract. However, an RAPD does not produce anisocoria. Anisocoria may result from damage to or interruption of the innervation to the iris sphincter or dilator muscle or from external pharmacologic factors, reflecting asymmetric autonomic nerve input to each iris.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pupillary anatomy and innervation are discussed in Chapter&#160;1, and the evaluation of an RAPD is described in Chapter&#160;3. This chapter reviews the clinical approach to patients with efferent pupillary disorders, including irregular pupils, anisocoria, and light–near dissociation.</p>
			<p class="h1">History</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with pupillary disturbances, particularly anisocoria, might not be aware of any abnormality. This is especially true in individuals with dark-&#173;colored irides. Anisocoria is usually asymptomatic, but patients may report photophobia, difficulty focusing with changes in illumination, or blurring of vision. The clinician should inquire about any new medications, ocular infections, face or neck trauma, headache or facial pain, diplopia, or change in eyelid position. Examination of the patient should include an assessment of the orbit, eyelid position, and ocular motility.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Pupillary Examination</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Examination of previous photographs (eg, a driver’s license) may reveal whether the pupillary abnormality was present previously. Clinical examination of the pupils requires a bright, even, handheld light source (such as a muscle light); a pupil-&#173;measuring gauge, preferably in half-&#173;millimeter increments; and an examination room in which background illumination is easily controlled. Eye drops such as cocaine, hydroxyamphetamine, apraclonidine, or pilocarpine may also be used to help assess the pupils. To evaluate pupil size, the clinician shines a handheld light obliquely from below the nose for indirect illumination and a clear view of the pupils, in both darkness and room light. To avoid accommodative miosis, the clinician asks the patient to fixate on a distant target and takes care not to block the patient’s fixation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To check the pupillary light reflex, the examiner briefly shines a bright focal light onto 1&#160;pupil and notes the speed and amplitude of the pupil’s constriction. Most clinicians observe only the illuminated pupil (the direct response) because it is difficult to simultaneously assess the consensual constriction of the contralateral pupil. In general, the direct and consensual pupillary responses are symmetric. Thus, shining a light onto a blind eye results in a poor pupillary response in both eyes, but if the light is moved onto the contralateral unaffected eye, both the pupil of the unaffected eye and the pupil of the blind eye (consensual response) constrict briskly. In other words, <span class="italic">poor vision in 1&#160;eye is never a cause of anisocoria.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">If the light response is abnormal, the pupillary near response should be examined. This test should be carried out in moderate room light so that the patient’s pupils are midsized. The clinician directs the patient to look at an accommodative target with fine detail. Although the near response is usually triggered by blurred or disparate imagery, it has a large volitional component, and the patient may need encouragement. Sometimes a better response is obtained if auditory input is added to the visual stimulus, such as a ticking watch, or if a proprioceptive target, such as the patient’s own thumbnail, is used. A lack of near response usually indicates that the patient is not trying hard enough. Light–near dissociation should be diagnosed only when the near response exceeds the best constriction that bright light can produce.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment is another essential part of the pupillary examination. Many ocular lesions can result in miosis, mydriasis, or poor pupillary response. Acute corneal injury or anterior chamber inflammation may explain a small pupil in the presence of ciliary spasm. In a patient with blurred vision, pain, red eye, and a dilated pupil, angle-&#173;closure glaucoma should be considered. Transillumination defects of the iris are evidence of iris damage from previous trauma, infection, or inflammation. Sectoral paralysis of the iris sphincter due to tonic pupil or aberrant regeneration of cranial nerve (CN)&#160;III is best observed by placing a wide beam at an angle to the iris and turning the light off and on while observing one sector of the sphincter at a time under high magnification. If the irides are intact, an innervational problem should be suspected.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pharmacologic agents can be used to confirm a clinical suspicion of Horner syndrome, tonic pupil, or pharmacologic mydriasis. However, pharmacologic pupillary testing is not infallible; false-&#173;positive and false-&#173;negative test results can occur. Therefore, test results must be interpreted on an individual basis.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Baseline Pupil Size</p>
				<div id="Chapt10_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Resting pupil size is influenced by several factors, including ambient light, state of retinal adaptation, level of arousal, and patient age. The frequency and amplitude of both pupils oscillate rhythmically and in synchrony; this phenomenon is called hippus. Hippus is independent of variations in illumination or in fixation of the eyes. Pupils typically become smaller as a result of aging. Sleepiness results in loss of cortical inputs that inhibit the Edinger-&#173;Westphal nucleus, thus causing small pupils. Severely elevated intraocular pressure may result in enlargement of the pupil, possibly due to iris ischemia. Pupils are often dilated after generalized tonic-&#173;clonic seizures. Extremely small pupils suggest pontine hemorrhage, narcotic intoxication, or pilocarpine use. Extremely large pupils may be normal (especially in young patients) or may suggest parasympathetic pharmacologic blockade from use of topical or systemic drugs, use of stimulants, or a state of high anxiety.</p>
            </div>
			<p class="h1">Pupil Irregularity</p>
				<div id="Chapt10_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pupil irregularity can result from many factors that are either congenital or acquired. Congenital iris malformations such as coloboma or aniridia result in abnormal pupil shape and reactivity. Acquired conditions that damage the mechanical compliance of the iris stroma or iris musculature can result in an irregular pupil. Blunt trauma to the eye can cause focal tears in the sphincter muscle. An <span class="italic">iridodialysis</span> occurs when the outer edge of the iris is torn away from its ciliary attachment. Intraocular inflammation can damage the iris or cause it to adhere to the lens or cornea <span class="italic">(synechiae)</span>. Neovascularization can also distort the iris and impair pupillary reactivity. A surgical procedure in the anterior segment may affect the shape or function of the pupil; cataract surgery is probably the leading cause of a misshapen pupil in an adult.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Two rare conditions of focal abnormality in iris innervation may cause pupillary irregularity:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-1">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="italic">Tadpole pupil.</span> This disorder is attributed to a focal spasm of the iris dilator muscle, which produces a peaking of the pupil that lasts a few minutes. The phenomenon may occur numerous times over several days or a week and then disappear. It is idiopathic, but a small percentage of patients harbor an underlying sympathetic lesion; thus, pharmacologic testing for Horner syndrome is suggested.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-2">&#9;2.&#9;<span class="italic">Midbrain corectopia.</span> In rare cases, eccentric or oval pupils are present in patients with rostral midbrain disease. The abnormality is presumably caused by incomplete damage of the pupillary fibers, leading to selective inhibition of iris sphincter tone.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Anisocoria</p>
				<div id="Chapt10_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Asymmetry of efferent signals to the iris muscles produces inequality in the diameters of the 2&#160;pupils. This phenomenon, called <span class="italic">anisocoria,</span> may be physiologic or pathologic. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;10-1</span> shows an algorithm for evaluating a patient with isolated anisocoria. Specific disorders are discussed in the following sections.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Normal Pupillary Response to Light</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When evaluating the pupils of a patient with anisocoria, the clinician should first check the pupillary light reflex (to determine whether the response to light is normal) and then evaluate whether the anisocoria is greater in dim or bright light. If the pupils react normally, the abnormality is of the sympathetic pathway. If one of the pupils responds abnormally to light, the next step is to examine the iris sphincter at the slit lamp to determine whether there are any secondary causes that explain the anisocoria.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Anisocoria Equal in Dim and Bright Light</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Physiologic anisocoria</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When the magnitude of the anisocoria is equal in dim and bright light, this indicates that the relative function of the pupillary sphincter and dilator muscles is intact. This scenario is consistent with physiologic anisocoria, and the patient can be reassured about the benign nature of this phenomenon.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Physiologic anisocoria (also known as <span class="italic">simple</span> or <span class="italic">essential anisocoria</span>) is the most common cause of a difference in pupil diameter. About 20% of individuals have noticeably asymmetric pupils. Usually the difference in pupil diameter is less than 1.0&#160;mm and can vary from day to day.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sometimes physiologic anisocoria is more apparent in dim light than in bright light. Ptosis occurring on the side of the smaller pupil may create diagnostic confusion with Horner syndrome. Pseudo-&#173;Horner and true Horner syndromes are best differentiated through pharmacologic testing (see the section “Horner syndrome” in this chapter).</p>
			<p class="reference-single--no-space-">Lam BL, Thompson HS, Corbett JJ. The prevalence of simple anisocoria. <span class="italic">Am&#160;J Ophthalmol.</span> 1987;104(1):69–73.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Anisocoria Greater in Dim Light</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anisocoria that is greater in dim light may be caused by a range of conditions. Identifying some of the causes require obtaining a thorough patient history (eg, pharmacologic agents); others can be identified by slit-lamp examination (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;10-1</span>). In general, causes of anisocoria that have a mechanical or inflammatory origin tend to produce a sluggish pupillary response to light, unlike Horner syndrome and physiologic anisocoria.</p>
			<p class="h3">Horner syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The presence of a lesion at any point along the oculosympathetic pathway results in Horner syndrome, which is characterized clinically by ipsilateral miosis (from unantagonized action of the iris sphincter), facial anhidrosis, ipsilateral upper eyelid ptosis, and mild lower eyelid elevation (upside-&#173;down ptosis). The ptosis is due to denervation of the tarsal muscle (Müller muscle) in both the upper and the lower eyelids, producing a noticeably narrower palpebral fissure and the false impression of enophthalmos. In the acute phase, conjunctival hyperemia, facial flushing, and nasal congestion can also be present.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The distribution of anhidrosis depends on the location of the lesion. Interruption of the central (first-&#173;order) or preganglionic (second-&#173;order) neuron causes anhidrosis of the ipsilateral head, face, and neck. This may produce a harlequin syndrome, in which one-half of the face is pale and the other half is normal or reddish in color, with the division exactly in the midline. Interestingly, the pale side of the face is the one with the sympathetic deficit because the vessels and perspiratory glands have been denervated, leading to supersensitivity to circulating adrenaline.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lesions at or distal to the superior cervical ganglion—that is, the postganglionic (third-&#173;order) neuron—result in anhidrosis limited to the ipsilateral forehead. When the lesion is congenital or acquired early in life, iris heterochromia develops (the affected iris appears lighter in color) but might not be detected until the age of 9–12&#160;months.</p>
			<p class="body-text">One of the clinical challenges in diagnosing Horner syndrome is differentiating it from physiologic anisocoria, because the pupillary reaction to light is normal with both conditions, and physiologic anisocoria may also be greater in dim light. One key difference is that pupillary dilation is intact in physiologic anisocoria, whereas there is dilation lag in Horner syndrome. Pupillary dilation in dim light is the result of sphincter relaxation and dilator contraction. Hence, a normal pupil dilates briskly in dim light. When a sympathetic lesion is present, the affected pupil dilates only by sphincter relaxation. In Horner syndrome, the weakened dilator muscle causes the pupil to dilate more slowly, producing an anisocoria that is greatest at 4–5&#160;seconds and less if remeasured at 15&#160;seconds. The presence of dilation lag is sufficient to differentiate Horner syndrome from physiologic anisocoria.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The oculosympathetic dysfunction of the pupil can also be confirmed pharmacologically with topical eyedrops of either cocaine or apraclonidine. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine released at sympathetic nerve terminals in the eye, causing pupillary dilation, eyelid retraction, and conjunctival blanching in the unaffected eye. In Horner syndrome, little or no norepinephrine is released into the synaptic cleft. Therefore, cocaine has no effect, and the miotic pupil remains smaller than the fellow pupil. The test is performed by instilling 2&#160;drops of cocaine, 4% or 10%, in each eye 5&#160;minutes apart and measuring the degree of anisocoria after 45&#160;minutes to 1&#160;hour. A postcocaine anisocoria of 1&#160;mm or greater is diagnostic of Horner syndrome on the side of the smaller pupil (see Fig&#160;10-1). Eyes with iris synechiae and a mechanically immobile pupil can cause false-&#173;positive cocaine test results, but such findings can be readily distinguished through slit-lamp examination. In addition, after instillation of topical phenylephrine 10% (a strong, direct-&#173;acting sympathomimetic drug), a mechanically restricted pupil will remain small, but in Horner syndrome, it will readily dilate.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Topical apraclonidine (0.5% or 1%), which is an <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonist and a weak <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-adrenergic agonist, is used routinely as a pharmacologic diagnostic test for Horner syndrome (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-2</span>). In most healthy eyes, apraclonidine has little effect on pupil size. In patients with Horner syndrome, the <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-agonist effect dominates because of the supersensitivity of the <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-receptors, resulting in relative mydriasis by contraction of the dilator muscle. For this test, 1&#160;drop of apraclonidine is placed in each eye, and the patient is reassessed 60&#160;minutes later (however, a positive result can often be detected before the 60&#160;minutes have elapsed). Reversal of the anisocoria is considered a positive response and confirms the diagnosis of Horner syndrome. In addition to the pupillary dilation, the upper eyelid ptosis improves as well.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, the role of apraclonidine has several limitations in the diagnosis of Horner syndrome. First, in theory, only postganglionic lesions should produce denervation supersensitivity. Although apraclonidine has been shown to trigger pupillary dilation in lesions at all levels of the sympathetic chain, the degree of sensitivity produced by central and preganglionic lesions is unclear. Second, denervation supersensitivity typically occurs several (2 to 5) days after injury to the sympathetic pathway; therefore, its role in acute lesions is questionable. In addition, apraclonidine is generally avoided in young children because it may cause central nervous system (CNS) depression or acute respiratory arrest. Cocaine remains a better choice for this age group, given its lower risk of adverse events. Brimonidine cannot be substituted for apraclonidine in pupil testing for Horner syndrome because it is a highly selective <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonist and has no significant effect on the <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-receptor on the iris dilator.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once a Horner syndrome is confirmed, it is possible to pharmacologically localize the lesion with topical hydroxyamphetamine (1%). Hydroxyamphetamine enhances the release of presynaptic norepinephrine from an intact postganglionic neuron; therefore, the pupil should dilate. If the pupil affected by Horner syndrome does not dilate, a lesion of the postganglionic neuron is suspected. If both pupils dilate well, the lesion is more proximal, in either the first- or second-&#173;order neuron (see Chapter&#160;1, Fig&#160;1-37). Because cocaine may interfere with the uptake and hence the efficacy of hydroxyamphetamine, 72&#160;hours should elapse between the 2&#160;tests.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because commercial preparations of topical hydroxyamphetamine have been difficult to obtain and its use is associated with a high rate of false-&#173;negative results, hydroxyamphetamine for localization of Horner syndrome is rarely used in clinical practice. In most instances, the clinical presentation is sufficient to suggest the site of injury and the necessary evaluation (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;10-2</span>). The presence of neurologic signs such as ataxia, nystagmus, and hemisensory deficit suggests a medullary lesion, indicating a potential need for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and upper cervical cord. Symptoms such as arm pain, cough, hemoptysis, and swelling in the neck suggest a second-&#173;order (preganglionic) lesion in the superior sulcus (Pancoast syndrome) or in the mediastinum, necessitating cervicothoracic imaging (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-3</span>). Symptoms associated with third-&#173;order (postganglionic) neuron injury include numbness over the first as well as the second or third divisions of CN&#160;V and double vision resulting from CN&#160;VI palsy, owing to the shared location of CN&#160;VI and oculosympathetic fibers in the cavernous sinus. Given the extent of the postganglionic fibers, modalities for investigation include MRI, with contrast, of the head, neck, and chest and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the neck or computed tomography (CT) of the head, neck, and chest and computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the neck. If examination of old photographs confirms that Horner syndrome has been present for several years, further investigation will probably be unproductive.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Horner syndrome associated with pain deserves special attention. Painful postganglionic Horner syndrome is a distinct clinical entity associated with several causes, most importantly an internal carotid artery dissection (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-4</span>). Pain from dissection is usually located around the temple and orbit, and may extend to the throat. Patients with painful postganglionic Horner syndrome may also have amaurosis fugax and altered taste (dysgeusia). This condition must be recognized promptly because in the acute stage, stroke is a possible complication. MRI typically shows an intramural hemorrhage of the internal carotid artery, but in some cases, MRA, CTA, or, in rare instances, cerebral arteriography is needed to detect evidence of the dissection (see Chapter&#160;14).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Trigeminal autonomic cephalgias, such as cluster headache, may also cause painful Horner syndrome during an acute attack (see Chapter&#160;12). The Horner syndrome often resolves but may become permanent after repeated attacks. Some patients, usually middle-&#173;aged men, have Horner syndrome and daily unilateral headaches not characteristic of cluster headache. This condition, for which no underlying pathology can be identified, is called <span class="italic">Raeder paratrigeminal syndrome</span>. This syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion made after careful evaluation for underlying pathology in the parasellar and cavernous sinus regions. If the site of the lesion is unknown, imaging of the brain, neck, spine, carotid arteries, chest, and pulmonary apex is indicated. This could be done with either MRI and MRA or CT and CTA.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Congenital Horner syndrome is usually caused by birth trauma to the brachial plexus. Nontraumatic Horner syndrome in infants and children raises the possibility of neuroblastoma arising in the sympathetic chain of the chest. In these circumstances, MRI of the head, neck, and chest is indicated. MRI of the abdomen may also be considered if clinical suspicion is high. Urinalysis for elevated levels of catecholamines and their metabolites is generally less sensitive than imaging studies in detecting neuroblastoma.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Anisocoria Greater in Bright Light</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Iris damage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blunt trauma to the eye can cause miosis or mydriasis. The pupil may be relatively miotic after injury due to spasm, thereafter becoming midsized or mydriatic, with poor responses to light and near stimulation. Notches in the pupillary margin or transillumination defects near the sphincter muscle are evidence of sphincter damage. Mydriasis resulting from direct iris sphincter damage does not respond to topical pilocarpine (1% or 2%) and thus mimics pharmacologic mydriasis. Slit-lamp examination should help the clinician differentiate traumatic mydriasis from other types of mydriasis. When iris injury occurs in patients with head trauma, the dilated pupil may be mistakenly identified as a sign of CN&#160;III palsy due to uncal herniation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prolonged or recurrent angle closure can also impair pupillary function, as can intraocular surgery (Urrets-&#173;Zavalia syndrome).</p>
			<p class="h3">Pharmacologic mydriasis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When anticholinergic medications are accidentally or intentionally instilled in the eye, the pupil becomes dilated, and its reactivity to light and near stimulation is lost and accommodation is impaired. Drug-&#173;induced dilation causes paralysis of the entire sphincter, in contrast to a tonic pupil, which causes segmental sphincter paralysis. Slit-lamp examination can help the clinician make this distinction. When mydriasis is induced by an anticholinergic drug such as atropine, instillation of full-&#173;strength pilocarpine (1% or more) will not reverse the mydriasis. Mydriasis caused by neurologic disease such as Adie tonic pupil or CN&#160;III palsy is easily overcome with instillation of full-&#173;strength or even dilute pilocarpine. Pharmacologic mydriasis from topical dilating drops usually results in a large pupil, measuring greater than 7&#160;mm. With adrenergic mydriasis, the pupil is large, the palpebral fissure is widened, and the conjunctiva may be blanched. Accommodation is not impaired. Pilocarpine 1% will cause some pupil contraction to an iris that has been dilated with <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-adrenergic agonists, but it won’t be as much as in an eye without adrenergic mydriasis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Adie tonic pupil</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Damage to the ciliary ganglion or short ciliary nerves (postganglionic parasympathetic nerve injury) produces an Adie tonic pupil, which is characterized by a large pupil with poor reaction to light but a strong and tonic pupillary response to near vision (light–near dissociation). The pupil experiences a slow tonic redilation on looking from near to far distances. Other characteristics include sectoral palsy of the iris sphincter (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-5</span>), accommodative paresis, and denervation cholinergic supersensitivity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">During the acute denervation phase of a tonic pupil, the pupil is dilated and poorly reactive to light stimulation and accommodative effort. Slit-lamp examination of the iris using high magnification can help the clinician distinguish functional sphincter segments from nonfunctional sphincter segments. Iris crypts stream toward areas of normal sphincter function, and the stroma bunches up along the pupillary border in such areas, producing vermiform movements. Stromal thinning—even atrophy—is observed in areas of sphincter paralysis (see Fig&#160;10-5).</p>
			<p class="body-text">As the damaged short ciliary nerves regenerate, misguided accommodative fibers sprout onto the iris sphincter, and the pupil recovers its ability to constrict in response to accommodative (or near) effort. However, pupillary movement (both constriction in response to an accommodative stimulus and subsequent redilation) is delayed and slow, that is, tonic (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-6</span>). This effect may account for patient reports of difficulty refocusing when switching from near vision to distance. The pupillary light reflex typically remains severely impaired.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Idiopathic tonic pupil is known as Adie tonic pupil. Approximately 70% of patients are female. Tonic pupils are unilateral in 80% of cases, but the second pupil may become involved later (4% of unilateral cases per year). <span class="italic">Holmes-&#173;Adie syndrome</span> includes other features, notably, diminished deep tendon reflexes and orthostatic hypotension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pharmacologic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis of Adie tonic pupil. The denervated iris sphincter is supersensitive to weak parasympathomimetic solutions, such as dilute pilocarpine eyedrops (0.1%). This pilocarpine strength can be obtained by diluting commercial 1% solution with balance salt solution, artificial tears, or sterile saline. Sixty minutes after eyedrop application, the pupils are reexamined. If parasympathetic denervation is present, the affected pupil will have constricted more than the normal pupil (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-7</span>). About 80% of patients with a tonic pupil demonstrate cholinergic supersensitivity, which develops within 5–7&#160;days of denervation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with tonic pupils may have accommodative symptoms or photophobia but just as often are asymptomatic. Accommodative symptoms are difficult to treat but usually resolve spontaneously within a few months after onset. When photophobia is a problem, topical dilute pilocarpine (0.1%) may be helpful. With time (months to years), an Adie tonic pupil decreases in size but remains poorly reactive to light, resulting in anisocoria that is greater in the dark than in the light. Histologic examination of the ciliary ganglion in patients with Adie tonic pupil has shown a reduction in the number of ganglion cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A tonic pupil can be caused by local ocular or orbital processes such as surgery, trauma, laser procedure, infection (eg, herpes zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, syphilis, botulism), inflammation, or ischemia. Tonic pupils can also be a manifestation of widespread autonomic dysfunction consequent to diabetes mellitus, chronic alcoholism, dysautonomias, neurosyphilis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, the Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-&#173;Barré syndrome, or Charcot-&#173;Marie-Tooth disease. In addition to bilateral tonic pupils with mydriasis, botulism toxicity may also produce bilateral ptosis and ocular motility dysfunction.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Third cranial nerve palsy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pupillary involvement in CN&#160;III palsy is almost always accompanied by ptosis and limited ocular motility (see Chapter&#160;7). At times, the motility disturbance is subtle, requiring quantitation with prism and alternate cover testing. Pupillary dysfunction is an important factor in the evaluation of acute CN&#160;III palsy. When the pupil is involved, an aneurysm must be excluded (see Chapter&#160;2, Fig&#160;2-11). If the pupil is spared and all other functions of CN&#160;III are completely paretic, an aneurysm is unlikely, and microvascular ischemic disease is more probable.</p>

			<p class="h1">Disorders of Pupillary Reactivity: Light–Near Dissociation</p>
				<div id="Chapt10_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Light–near dissociation occurs when a near response exceeds the greatest pupillary constriction that bright light can produce. The physiologic basis for light–near dissociation is because the near reflex bypasses the pretectal nuclei in the dorsal midbrain and descends from higher cortical centers directly to the Edinger-&#173;Westphal nuclei. Light–near dissociation may arise from a variety of causes (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;10-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Afferent Visual Pathway</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optic neuropathy is the most common cause of light–near dissociation (unilateral or bilateral). It is the result of damage to only the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex (optic nerve); the central near impulses remain unaffected.</p>
			<p class="h2">Midbrain</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dorsal midbrain damage can result in midsized pupils with poor light response and preserved near response. Such responses occur when the lesion spares the more ventrally located fibers of the near reflex pathway. Associated findings include bilateral eyelid retraction (Collier sign), vertical gaze palsy, accommodative paresis, and convergence-&#173;retraction nystagmus (Parinaud syndrome; see Chapter&#160;8, Fig&#160;8-5).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Argyll Robertson pupil</span> occurs in patients with tertiary syphilis involving the CNS. Affected patients have small pupils (&lt;2&#160;mm in diameter) that are often irregular. The pupils do not react to light, but the near response and subsequent redilation are normal and brisk. These characteristics distinguish Argyll Robertson pupils from bilateral chronic tonic pupils (which may also result from neurosyphilis). In addition, iris atrophy frequently occurs, portions of the iris transilluminate, and dilation is poor after instillation of mydriatic eyedrops.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Argyll Robertson–like pupils are observed in widespread autonomic neuropathies such as bilateral tonic pupils (chronic), diabetes mellitus, and chronic alcoholism, as well as in encephalitis and after panretinal photocoagulation. Serologic tests for syphilis should be considered in the evaluation of patients with bilateral pupillary light–near dissociation with miosis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Aberrant Regeneration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Light–near dissociation can also result from aberrant regeneration of damaged nerves that restores the near reflex but not the light reflex. Misdirected growth can occur after traumatic injury or chronic compression of CN&#160;III. Sometimes aberrant regeneration involves the medial rectus fibers and pupillary contraction occurs during attempted adduction. This synkinetic pupil movement can resemble light–near dissociation.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Benign Episodic Unilateral Mydriasis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Also known as <span class="italic">springing pupil,</span> benign episodic unilateral mydriasis typically occurs in young, healthy individuals who frequently have a history of headache. Episodic mydriasis may last from minutes to hours and may be accompanied by mild blurring of vision, periocular discomfort, and headache. Each episode is self-&#173;limited, and the condition has not been associated with any systemic or neurologic disease.</p>
