			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Certain neurologic and medical disorders are encountered commonly enough within the context of an ophthalmic clinical practice and affect vision with such frequency that they deserve separate emphasis. Although the following discussion is not comprehensive, it is intended to cover many aspects of diseases with which ophthalmologists should be familiar.</p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Immunologic Disorders</p>
				<div id="Chapt14_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Of the variety of immune system–mediated disorders that produce neuro-&#173;ophthalmic signs and symptoms, giant cell arteritis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, thyroid eye disease, and sarcoidosis are the most common.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Giant Cell Arteritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Giant cell arteritis (GCA), or <span class="italic">temporal arteritis,</span> is a systemic inflammatory granulomatous vasculitis that involves large- and medium-&#173;sized arteries and affects mainly white people over 50&#160;years of age almost exclusively. The incidence of the disease increases with age; it is 20&#160;times more common in the ninth decade than the sixth decade. GCA is 2–4&#160;times more likely to affect women than men, and it is more common in people of Northern European and Scandinavian descent. Early diagnosis and treatment of GCA can limit or prevent permanent vision loss.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Clinical presentation of giant cell arteritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Systemic symptoms of GCA include headache and tenderness of the temporal artery or scalp. Jaw or tongue claudication (a cramping pain that develops while chewing or talking) is the symptom most specific for the disorder; other symptoms include malaise, anorexia and weight loss, fever, new neck pain, ear pain, and joint and muscle pain. Systemic sequelae can include cerebrovascular ischemia, myocardial infarction, and aortic aneurysm or dissection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Visual symptoms may include diplopia or transient or permanent vision loss. The most common cause of vision loss is <span class="italic">arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION)</span>  (see Chapter&#160;4, Fig&#160;4-10), but central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), cilioretinal artery occlusion, posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, choroidal infarction, ocular ischemic syndrome, and orbital ischemia also occur. Ischemia of the ocular motor cranial nerves (CNs), extraocular muscles, or brainstem can result in transient or constant diplopia.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When evaluating patients over age 50 with the visual symptoms just described, a high level of suspicion of GCA is paramount. Diagnostic evaluation begins with laboratory tests of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), complete blood count (CBC), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Most cases of GCA show marked elevation of the Westergren ESR (mean 70&#160;mm/hr; often &gt;100&#160;mm/hr), but the level may be normal in up to 16% of cases. The ESR rises with anemia and with increasing age; levels above the laboratory’s listed upper limit of normal are common in patients older than 70&#160;years without arteritis. A more accurate estimate of the upper normal value can be obtained by using these formulas: [age]/2 <span class="italic">(men)</span> or [age + 10]/2 <span class="italic">(women).</span> Measurement of CRP level, which may be more specific and less affected by increasing age and anemia, may increase diagnostic accuracy and is typically obtained in conjunction with the ESR. Thrombocytosis (increased platelet count) may suggest active disease. A normochromic normocytic anemia may be present.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Whenever clinical suspicion or laboratory studies suggest the possibility of GCA, temporal artery biopsy (TAB) should be performed, ideally at a site of localized tenderness and/or on the side of the vision loss (see BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors</span>). The TAB needs to be done as soon as possible, ideally within 2&#160;weeks, but in some cases remains positive for months after initiation of therapy. A unilateral TAB can be falsely negative in approximately 3%–15% of cases. Factors that may produce a false-&#173;negative unilateral TAB include discontinuous arterial involvement (“skip areas”), missed lesions, or inadequate sections (under 2&#160;cm long). If the index of suspicion remains high, a contralateral TAB is typically performed. Other imaging strategies such as color Doppler ultrasonography, positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide additional useful diagnostic clues; however, TAB remains the gold standard for GCA diagnosis.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Treatment of giant cell arteritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment of GCA; they should be initiated immediately when GCA is suspected. Approximately 50% of patients with GCA and vision loss in 1 eye will lose vision in the opposite eye within 7&#160;days if the GCA is left untreated. Intravenous methylprednisolone (1&#160;g/day for the first 3–5&#160;days) is often recommended when vision loss is present. For patients with suspected GCA but without loss of vision, oral prednisone 60–100&#160;mg/day may be sufficient. Treatment is also required for patients with severe, bilateral vision loss because GCA is a systemic disease. The clinical response to corticosteroids is often dramatic; symptoms may be reduced within days. The corticosteroids are generally tapered slowly, depending on response, and patients typically continue therapy for at least 1–2&#160;years, sometimes longer. Patients undergoing long-term corticosteroid therapy should be monitored and treated as necessary for osteopenia and osteoporosis as well as prophylaxis of gastrointestinal effects; it is recommended that these patients be comanaged with a rheumatologist or internist. Corticosteroid treatment does not generally improve vision, but it may prevent new ischemic events from occurring. The risk of recurrent or contralateral optic nerve involvement during withdrawal from corticosteroid treatment has been reported at 7%; thus, as mentioned, tapering must be done slowly and carefully. Patients must also be monitored for thoracic and aortic aneurysms, which are associated with GCA. Additionally, these patients are at increased risk of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular ischemia; thus, low-dose aspirin administration should be considered.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Multiple Sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), causes progressive neurologic disability over time. Patients with MS frequently have visual symptoms, and the ophthalmologist is often the first physician consulted. Familiarity with both the ocular and neurologic consequences of MS is important for guiding the ophthalmologist to the appropriate diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Epidemiology and genetics of multiple sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The prevalence of MS varies widely. It is more common in whites and in individuals living in latitudes greater than 40&#160;degrees from the equator and is 2–3&#160;times more likely to affect women than men. MS is relatively uncommon in children younger than 10&#160;years; the incidence is highest among young adults (25–40&#160;years). However, onset even after the age of 50&#160;years is not rare.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cause of MS remains unknown. Vitamin&#160;D deficiency is a risk factor for MS. The risk of MS is also significantly increased in first-&#173;degree relatives of patients with the disease. Although there is a strong association with the HLA-DRB1 antigen, the genetic associations are multifactorial.</p>
			<p class="h3">Course and prognosis of multiple sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most patients with MS (85%) initially experience a relapsing-&#173;remitting clinical course with episodes of neurologic dysfunction that are separated by intervals of months or years. However, MRI studies have revealed that pathologic disease burden in the CNS accumulates even in the absence of clinical activity. Within 10&#160;years, approximately 50% of patients with relapsing-&#173;remitting disease exhibit a slow, apparently continuous deterioration in neurologic status (secondary progressive form). In approximately 15% of patients, the disease progresses inexorably from onset with no recognizable attacks (primary progressive form). Near total disability and, in rare instances, death within 1–2&#160;years of onset may result after a fulminant course. In contrast, about 5%–10% of patients experience a relatively benign course without serious disability or life span reduction.</p>
			<p class="h3">Pathology in multiple sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although MS is classically considered a demyelinating disease, axonal damage does occur early and is an integral part of the disease process. This axonal loss manifests as “black holes” on T1-weighted MRI sequences (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-1</span>). Myelin destruction is associated with local perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration, myelin removal by macrophages, and astrocytic proliferation with production of glial fibrils. The term <span class="italic">multiple sclerosis</span> stems from the presence of these numerous gliotic (sclerotic) plaque lesions. Plaques are often situated in the white matter at the ventricular margins, the optic nerves and chiasm, the corpus callosum, and the spinal cord and throughout the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles.</p>

			<p class="h3">Clinical presentation of multiple sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diagnosis of MS is made by identifying neurologic symptoms and signs that occur over time and that affect different areas of the CNS. Ocular symptomatology is commonly part of the clinical picture of MS, and various ocular complications are discussed in the following sections. Nonocular signs and symptoms attributable to MS may precede, follow, or coincide with the ocular signs. Initially, many symptoms of MS are so transient or benign that the patient may fail to remember previous episodes. Typically, significant episodes last for weeks or months. The physician should ask specifically about transient diplopia, ataxia, vertigo, patchy paresthesias, bladder or bowel dysfunction, and extremity weakness. Fatigue and depression are common and may precede the onset of focal neurologic deficits. Symptoms of early MS are often so evanescent and unaccompanied by objective neurologic findings that they may be ignored.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord may be involved individually or simultaneously, thus producing single or multiple symptoms. Some of the more common <span class="italic">nonocular</span> symptoms include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-8"><span class="italic">cerebellar dysfunction:</span> ataxia, dysarthria, intention tremor, truncal or head titubation, or dysmetria (sometimes described by the patient as poor depth perception)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">mental changes:</span> emotional instability, depression, irritability, or fatigue; later in the course, cognitive dysfunction</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">motor symptoms:</span> extremity weakness, facial weakness, hemiparesis, or paraplegia</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">sensory symptoms:</span> paresthesias of face or body (especially in a bandlike distribution around the trunk), Lhermitte sign (an electric shock–like sensation in the limbs and trunk that is produced by neck flexion), or pain (occasionally, trigeminal neuralgia)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-9"><span class="italic">sphincter disturbances:</span> frequency, urgency, hesitancy, or incontinence; urinary retention that leads to urinary tract infection</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3">Optic neuritis in multiple sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinical signs and symptoms of optic neuritis are discussed in Chapter&#160;4. Even after recovering from vision loss brought on by demyelinating optic neuritis, patients may experience transient deterioration of vision during exercise or with small elevations in body temperature (Uhthoff phenomenon). Some patients with optic neuritis report phosphenes (bright flashes of light) with movement of the affected eye or photisms (light induced by noise, smell, taste, or touch). Importantly, 25% of patients have optic neuritis as a presenting symptom of MS, and their first evaluation will be performed by an ophthalmologist. Symptoms of optic neuritis occur at some point in 75% of patients, and evidence of optic nerve involvement as demonstrated by an abnormal visual evoked response appears in 90% of patients with MS. Furthermore, autopsy studies show anterior visual pathway demyelination in virtually all patients with clinically definite MS. There is increasing interest in the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure the retinal nerve fiber layer and retinal ganglion cell layer in MS as a marker for neuronal damage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">After an episode of optic neuritis, many patients want to know their risk of MS. The 15-year follow-&#173;up of the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) showed that the strongest predictive factor in determining the likelihood that MS would develop was the presence or absence of abnormalities on MRI scan of the brain obtained at study entry during an episode of optic neuritis. Overall, clinically definite MS developed in 50% of ONTT patients in 15&#160;years. However, the probability of developing clinically definite MS based on MRI scan appearance ranged from 25% for patients with no lesions on the brain MRI to 72% for patients with 1 or more lesions. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in a subgroup of ONTT patients showed that oligoclonal banding had predictive value for the development of MS, but only in patients with a normal MRI scan at study entry. Patients with a history of prior optic neuritis and nonspecific neurologic symptoms were at higher risk of MS.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Funduscopic abnormalities in multiple sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retinal nerve fiber layer defects are discussed in Chapter&#160;3. Uveitis is 10&#160;times more common in MS patients than in the general population. Depending on the study, uveitis frequency in patients with MS varies widely, occurring in 0.4%–28.5% of patients. Ocular inflammation may develop concurrent with, prior to, or after the development of neurologic signs and symptoms. MS-&#173;related uveitis generally presents as intermediate uveitis (including pars planitis), and common findings include mild vitritis with periphlebitis. See BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis</span> for a more extensive review of MS-&#173;related uveitis.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Chiasmal and retrochiasmal abnormalities in multiple sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The white matter within the optic chiasm, optic tracts, and visual radiations is frequently involved pathologically in MS lesions. Lesions in these areas follow a recovery pattern similar to that of optic neuritis. Chiasmal or retrochiasmal visual field defects were observed in 13.2% of patients in the ONTT after 1&#160;year of follow-&#173;up (see Chapter&#160;4, Fig&#160;4-29). Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) should be considered when a patient with MS using natalizumab presents with homonymous visual field defects (see Table&#160;14-1 and the section Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy later in this chapter).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Ocular motility disturbances in multiple sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diplopia is a frequent MS symptom. Motility abnormalities resulting from MS are typically localized to the supranuclear, nuclear, and fascicular portions of the ocular motor system. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia, especially when bilateral, may present with exotropia in primary position and bilaterally impaired adduction (ie, wall-eyed, bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia, or WEBINO; see Chapter&#160;7, Fig&#160;7-5); it is highly suggestive of MS in someone under age 50&#160;years. Other signs include complete or partial paralysis of horizontal or vertical gaze or a skew deviation (vertical misalignment not attributable to single CN or muscle dysfunction). Although uncommon, MS should be considered in a young adult with an isolated ocular motor CN palsy and no history of trauma. Because ocular motor palsies most likely reflect fascicular involvement, they are frequently accompanied by other brainstem findings. CN&#160;VI involvement is most commonly reported, but CN&#160;III or CN&#160;IV paresis has also been described.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nystagmus is frequently present in MS. It may be horizontal, rotary, or vertical, and both pendular and jerk types may occur. Concomitant vertical and horizontal nystagmus occurring out of phase produces circular or elliptical eye movements that are highly suggestive of MS. Common cerebellar eye findings include rebound nystagmus, fixation instability (macrosaccadic oscillations), saccadic dysmetria, and abnormal pursuit movements. Occasionally, MS lesions produce dorsal midbrain (Parinaud) syndrome. Patients with eye movement abnormalities typically report symptoms, including diplopia, blurred vision, or oscillopsia. See Chapters&#160;7, 8, and&#160;9 for further discussion on ocular motility disorders.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">MS is diagnosed using the modified McDonald criteria, which are based on the combination of clinical history and presentation, along with neuroradiologic imaging, with or without CSF abnormality or an abnormal visual evoked response. Even an insidious neurologic progression suggestive of MS can lead to a definite diagnosis if appropriate paraclinical abnormalities are present. However, in the absence of other clinical or laboratory manifestations, recurrent optic neuritis is not sufficient for diagnosing MS.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="h4-head">Laboratory evaluation of multiple sclerosis</span> No test unequivocally establishes the presence of MS, which remains a <span class="italic">clinical</span> diagnosis. The CSF in patients with definite MS is abnormal in more than 90% of cases. The most common abnormalities are elevation of immunoglobulin&#160;G (IgG) level, elevation of the IgG/albumin index, and the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (in CSF but not in serum). None of these findings, however, is specific for MS.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-10"><span class="h4-head">Neuroimaging in multiple sclerosis</span> The neuroimaging study of choice for the diagnosis and management of MS is an MRI scan with <span class="italic">fluid-&#173;attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)</span> sequencing and gadolinium-DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) infusion. The MRI scan is particularly sensitive for the identification of white matter plaques in the CNS, and it is far superior to CT&#160;scan for showing the posterior fossa and spinal cord (see Fig&#160;14-1; see also Chapter&#160;2, Fig&#160;2-9, and Chapter&#160;4, Fig&#160;4-8). The MRI scan shows multiple lesions in 85%–95% of patients with clinically definite MS and in 66%–76% of patients with suspected MS. Although the abnormalities apparent on MRI scan are not specific for MS, multifocal lesions that are periventricular and ovoid are most consistent with the condition. The lesions observed with MRI fluctuate over time. Active lesions will enhance with gadolinium-&#173;DTPA administration. Hypointense regions on postcontrast T1-weighted scans (black holes) are also a marker of progressive disease. Lesions in the optic nerves of patients with symptomatic optic neuritis are best visualized on MRI scan with fat-&#173;suppression techniques and gadolinium-DTPA infusion (see Fig&#160;4-8C).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Treatment of multiple sclerosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">There is no cure for MS; however, several therapies slow the disease and help alleviate specific symptoms. As in the management of optic neuritis, intravenous high-dose corticosteroids are often used to treat acute exacerbations of MS. Although vitamin&#160;D deficiency is routinely corrected in newly diagnosed MS patients or in patients at risk of MS, the benefit of such therapy remains unproven.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Disease-&#173;modifying therapy (DMT) is typically recommended for long-term treatment of MS. Several studies, including CHAMPS (<span class="italic">C</span>ontrolled <span class="italic">H</span>igh-Risk Subjects <span class="italic">A</span>vonex <span class="italic">M</span>ultiple <span class="italic">S</span>clerosis <span class="italic">P</span>revention <span class="italic">S</span>tudy), ETOMS (<span class="italic">E</span>arly <span class="italic">T</span>reatment of <span class="italic">M</span>ultiple <span class="italic">S</span>clerosis), BENEFIT (<span class="italic">Be</span>taferon in <span class="italic">N</span>ewly <span class="italic">E</span>merging Multiple Sclerosis <span class="italic">f</span>or <span class="italic">I</span>nitial <span class="italic">T</span>reatment), and PreCISe (Early Glatiramer Acetate Treatment in Delaying Conversion to Clinically Definite Multiple Sclerosis in Subjects <span class="italic">Pre</span>senting with a <span class="italic">C</span>linically <span class="italic">I</span>solated <span class="italic">S</span>yndrom<span class="italic">e</span>), have demonstrated the benefits of early DMT initiation in subjects with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) at risk of developing MS. There are several United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved disease-&#173;modifying drugs currently available for relapsing forms of MS (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;14-1</span>). These drugs, which should be used with caution, are often prescribed by physicians experienced in MS therapy. Novel drugs and combinations of immunomodulating therapies are being investigated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Macular edema has been reported in 0.5% of patients treated with fingolimod, a once-&#173;daily oral medication approved for the treatment of relapsing MS. This ophthalmic complication, also known as FAME (fingolimod-&#173;associated macular edema), is more common in patients with diabetes and uveitis and is more likely to develop within 4&#160;months of treatment initiation. The macular edema typically resolves upon cessation of fingolimod therapy. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;14-2</span> lists the screening protocol for FAME.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Neuromyelitis Optica</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also called Devic disease, is an inflammatory CNS disorder that is associated with serum aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin&#160;G (AQP4-IgG) antibodies. NMO is characterized by severe attacks of optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. NMO represents a rare cause of inflammatory white matter disease in North America; however, it accounts for almost 50% of demyelinating disorders in Asia and the West Indies. NMO can be differentiated from MS by its distinct clinical, radiographic, pathologic, and serologic features. NMO is associated with severe visual impairment; early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are important for the best chance of preserving visual and neurologic function.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Clinical presentation of neuromyelitis optica</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optic neuritis, the classic ophthalmic manifestation of NMO, is typically severe (visual acuity &lt;20/200) and is associated with poor visual recovery. Bilateral visual symptoms, recurrent optic neuritis, poor visual outcomes, or concurrent autoimmune disease should raise a concern for NMO-&#173;related optic neuritis (see Chapter&#160;4).</p>
			<p class="body-text">NMO may involve the optic chiasm and tracts, resulting in bitemporal or homonymous hemianopic visual field defects. Eye movement disorders such as nystagmus (upbeat, downbeat, or mixed horizontal-&#173;torsional), internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and opsoclonus can develop secondary to brainstem lesions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with transverse myelitis may present with weakness and numbness of the limbs, deficits in sensation and motor skills, dysfunctional sphincter activities, or dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. NMO is a central cause of refractory hiccups and vomiting due to caudal medullary lesions (the area postrema and the nucleus tractus solitarius).</p>
			<p class="h3">Diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The development of the NMO-IgG (AQP4-IgG antibody) test has drastically improved our ability to diagnose NMO. However, the test is negative in approximately 25% of patients. In 2015, an international panel published revised diagnostic criteria for NMO and also recommended unifying NMO and related syndromes under the new nomenclature of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) (see Chapter&#160;4, Table&#160;4-5, for criteria in diagnosing NMOSD).</p>
			<p class="body-text">CSF findings suggestive of NMO include a pleocytosis greater than 50&#160;cells per microliter, a high percentage of polymorphonuclear cells, or the presence of eosinophils. In rare instances, CSF AQP4-IgG has been detected in seronegative patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Conventional MRI shows typical changes resulting from acute optic neuritis with NMO, including optic nerve enlargement and enhancement, as well as increased T2&#160;signal. These changes, which are often more longitudinally extensive than in MS, are frequently bilateral and may involve the optic chiasm and tracts. Brain MRI abnormalities at onset have been reported in 43%–70% of patients with NMOSD. NMO lesions are typically found in the areas surrounding the third ventricle and the cerebral aqueduct (which include the thalamus, hypothalamus, and anterior border of the midbrain), as well as the dorsal brainstem adjacent to the fourth ventricle and the corpus callosum. Extensive and confluent hemispheric white matter lesions can also be seen, occasionally mimicking posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES; discussed later). Spinal cord MRI typically shows contiguous T2-weighted signal abnormality extending over 3 or more vertebral segments.</p>

			<p class="h3">Treatment of neuromyelitis optica</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">NMO treatment includes managing acute attacks and preventing future exacerbations. For patients experiencing an acute attack, intravenous methylprednisolone therapy (1000&#160;mg daily for 3–5&#160;days) remains the first-line therapy. If there is no significant clinical improvement on corticosteroids, plasma exchange has been shown to be effective and should be considered. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has also been used to treat acute NMO exacerbations and prevent relapses. Immunosuppressive therapy (eg, azathioprine, mycophenolate, or rituximab) is generally instituted after the initial attack to lower the frequency and severity of future exacerbations. Several disease-&#173;modifying agents frequently used for treatment of MS (eg, interferon-&#173;beta, natalizumab, and fingolimod) may increase the relapse rate in patients with NMO. This phenomenon likely reflects the different immunobiology of these conditions, emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis in guiding optimal treatment decisions.</p>

			<p class="h2">Myasthenia Gravis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an immunologic disorder characterized by variable and fatigable weakness. Most patients with MG develop neuro-&#173;ophthalmic abnormalities. Although the disease is usually a systemic disorder, one-half of affected patients have ocular symptoms and signs at onset. The pathophysiology arises from antibodies that reduce the number of available nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. MG may be caused, unmasked, or worsened by numerous types of medications, including antiarrhythmics, statins, antibiotics, chemotherapeutic drugs, antiepileptics, quinolones, penicillamine, corticosteroids, <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers, and calcium channel blockers.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical presentation of myasthenia gravis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The hallmarks of MG are fluctuation and fatigability (although these are not invariably present). Clinical signs and symptoms usually worsen in the evening and with use of the eyes and may improve with rest. The most common sign of MG is unilateral or bilateral ptosis. The extent of ptosis tends to vary, with the eyelid more ptotic in the evening, after exertion, or after prolonged upward gaze. Cogan eyelid twitch, elicited by having the patient initiate saccades during refixation from downgaze to upgaze, is a brief overelevation of the upper eyelid. Another eyelid sign is enhancement of ptosis; when the more ptotic eyelid is elevated manually, the less ptotic eyelid falls, in keeping with Hering’s law of motor correspondence (equal and simultaneous innervation) (see Chapter&#160;11, Fig&#160;11-3). Fatigue of ptosis can be assessed by asking the patient to sustain upgaze for 1&#160;minute or longer.</p>
			<p class="body-text">MG frequently causes diplopia. The diplopia may be variable, both during the day and from one day to another. The ocular motility pattern may simulate ocular motor CN paresis (usually CN&#160;VI or partial, pupil-&#173;sparing CN&#160;III palsy), internuclear ophthalmoplegia, supranuclear motility disturbances (eg, gaze palsies), or isolated muscle “palsy” (eg, isolated inferior rectus). Total ophthalmoplegia can also occur. Any changing pattern of diplopia, with or without ptosis, should suggest MG. As with ptosis, motility fatigue can also be assessed by having the patient sustain gaze in the direction of paresis. Orbicularis oculi weakness is often present in patients with ocular MG and, if present, can be diagnostically crucial in differentiating MG from other causes of external ophthalmoplegia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because the pupil contains muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, pupillary abnormalities are not associated with MG; if abnormalities are present, the clinician should search for another diagnosis. Systemic symptoms and signs that are associated with MG include dysarthria, dysphagia, dyspnea, hoarseness, and weakness in the mastication muscles and in the extensors of the neck, trunk, and limbs. Dysphagia and dyspnea can be life threatening and require prompt treatment. Thyroid eye disease (TED) occurs in about 5% of MG patients. The presence of exotropia and/or ptosis in a patient with TED should raise a concern for superimposed MG.</p>
			<p class="h3">Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diagnosis of MG is made clinically by identifying typical signs and symptoms, pharmacologically by overcoming the receptor block via the administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, serologically by demonstrating elevated anti–acetylcholine receptor antibody titers or anti–muscle-&#173;specific kinase antibodies, and electrophysiologically by electromyography (EMG) results.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If an obvious abnormality is present on examination, results of an <span class="italic">edrophonium chloride</span> (a short-&#173;acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) <span class="italic">test,</span> a <span class="italic">sleep test,</span> or an <span class="italic">ice-pack test</span> can confirm the diagnosis of MG. Edrophonium chloride tests are not commonly performed in eye clinics because rare but serious adverse effects from administration of the drug can occur, including bradycardia, bronchospasm, cholinergic crisis, respiratory arrest, or syncopal episodes. Thus, consultation with the primary physician is suggested before performing the test on patients with a history of cardiac or pulmonary disease. Atropine sulfate (0.4–0.6&#160;mg) should be available immediately in case it is needed. Some physicians pretreat with atropine (0.4&#160;mg subcutaneously) before administering the edrophonium. Patients should also be warned of the possibility of the medication’s short-lived but often discomforting adverse reactions, including fasciculations, sweating, lacrimation, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and salivation. In most protocols, a small test dose of 2&#160;mg (0.2&#160;mL) edrophonium is first injected intravenously, and the patient is observed for 60&#160;seconds. If the symptoms disappear or decrease (for example, the eyelid elevates or motility improves), the test result is considered positive and can be discontinued. If no response is elicited, additional doses of 4&#160;mg, up to a total of 10&#160;mg, are given. When the ocular symptom is marked (eg, complete ptosis), the endpoint (eyelid elevation) is often dramatic. However, a subtle deficit, such as minimal diplopia, may require use of other means to better define the endpoint. Maddox rod tests with prisms or diplopia fields may be performed before and after edrophonium (see Chapter&#160;7). False-&#173;positive responses are rare. A negative test result does not exclude a diagnosis of MG, and repeat testing at a later date may be needed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An alternative to the edrophonium test is the <span class="italic">neostigmine methylsulfate test.</span> This test is particularly useful for children and for adults without ptosis who may require a longer observation period for accurate ocular alignment measurements than that allowed by edrophonium testing. Adverse reactions are similar to those for edrophonium, the most frequent of which are salivation, fasciculations, and gastrointestinal discomfort. Intramuscular neostigmine and atropine are injected concurrently. A positive test result produces improvement of signs within 30–45&#160;minutes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">sleep test</span> is a safe, simple office test that eliminates the need for edrophonium testing in many patients. After the baseline deficit has been documented (eg, measurements of ptosis, motility disturbance), the patient rests quietly with eyes closed for 30&#160;minutes. The measurements are repeated immediately after the patient “wakes up” and opens his or her eyes. Improvement after rest is highly suggestive of MG.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">ice-pack test</span> is often helpful for diagnosing MG, but only if the patient has ptosis. An ice pack is placed over the patient’s lightly closed eyes for 2&#160;minutes. Improvement of ptosis occurs in most patients with MG (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-3</span>); however, the cooling effect may be insufficient to overcome the severe weakness in patients with <span class="italic">complete</span> myasthenic ptosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other diagnostic tests for MG include electrophysiologic testing and serum assays for anti–acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies or anti–muscle-&#173;specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies. There are 3&#160;types of commercially available AChR antibody tests: binding, blocking, and modulating. Tests for binding antibodies are usually requested first, because these highly specific antibodies (near 100% specificity) are detected in approximately 90% of patients with generalized MG and in 50%–70% of patients with ocular MG. Blocking antibodies are rarely present (1%) without binding antibodies. Modulating antibodies are present as frequently as binding antibodies. Blocking and modulating antibody testing is usually reserved for patients who test negative for the binding antibody and for whom MG is still suspected. An assay for MuSK antibodies may confirm an MG diagnosis in some patients who do not have AChR antibodies. MuSK-&#173;positive patients tend to have prominent bulbar weakness (eg, dysphagia, dysphonia, chewing difficulties) and will present with purely ocular manifestations only in rare instances.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Electromyographic repetitive nerve stimulation</span> shows a characteristic decremental response in many patients with systemic MG. Single-&#173;fiber electromyography is most sensitive for MG. All patients with MG should be investigated radiologically for thymomas, which are observed on computed tomography (CT) scans in 10% of these patients. Malignant thymomas are present in a small percentage of patients. Because there is a high coexistence of MG with other autoimmune disorders, serologic testing should be done for thyroid dysfunction and systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Treatment of myasthenia gravis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Symptomatic, nonpharmacologic treatment for ptosis or diplopia may include use of a patch, a ptosis crutch, or prisms; however, prisms are typically used when the variability is small and with the understanding that the treatment is not always helpful. Pharmacologic treatment for MG includes the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, neostigmine and pyridostigmine), corticosteroids, and other immunosuppressant drugs. Thymectomy is performed in patients with a thymoma and should be considered in patients with generalized MG with or without thymic abnormalities. Short-term therapies such as IVIg or plasmapheresis are occasionally necessary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">MG is a systemic disease with disastrous potential. Although purely ocular MG does exist, systemic MG will develop over the next 2&#160;years in up to 85% of patients who present with ocular MG. Because MG patients may develop respiratory and other life-&#173;threatening manifestations, it is prudent to manage their care in cooperation with a neurologist. If ocular signs remain truly isolated for more than 2&#160;years, the disease is likely to remain clinically ocular; nevertheless, late conversion to generalized MG is possible.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Thyroid eye disease (TED), also known as <span class="italic">thyroid-&#173;associated orbitopathy</span> and <span class="italic">Graves ophthalmopathy,</span> is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sarcoidosis is a multisystem, noncaseating granulomatous inflammation commonly diagnosed in young adults aged 20–40&#160;years. In North America, the annual incidence for blacks is about 3&#160;times the incidence for whites, and the disease is more common in women than in men. Although the lungs are involved most frequently, the eyes, heart, lacrimal glands, liver, lymph nodes, skin, and musculoskeletal system are also commonly affected. Neurologic manifestations, which occur in 5%–15% of patients, include CN involvement, meningitis, hydrocephalus, hypothalamic and pituitary involvement, encephalopathy, seizures, dural venous thrombosis, vasculitis, myelopathy, and peripheral neuropathy. However, 30%–60% of cases may be discovered incidentally on a routine chest radiograph.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of sarcoidosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After the facial nerve, the optic nerve is the CN most frequently affected by sarcoidosis; it may manifest as either a papillitis or retrobulbar optic neuropathy. Less commonly, a sarcoid granuloma may occur at the optic nerve head (ONH) (see Chapter&#160;4, Fig&#160;4-13). Infrequently, sarcoidosis may cause neuroretinitis, optic perineuritis, or papilledema. Bitemporal and homonymous visual field defects may also occur from chiasmal and retrochiasmal visual pathway involvement. Sarcoidosis can also cause ocular motor CN&#160;palsy, gaze palsy, and a variety of pupillary abnormalities, including tonic pupil, Horner syndrome, and Argyll Robertson pupil.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Diagnosis and treatment of sarcoidosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The diagnostic criteria for sarcoidosis include clinical symptoms and signs along with supporting, radiographic, and/or histologic results. Although most patients with neurosarcoidosis exhibit abnormalities on MRI scan, about 18% do not. The most common neuroimaging abnormalities are meningeal and leptomeningeal enhancing lesions. However, none of the abnormalities observed on MRI scan are specific for sarcoidosis, and establishing a definite diagnosis can be difficult.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Serum markers such as angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme (ACE) and lysozyme have been associated with sarcoidosis. The sensitivity and specificity of ACE as a diagnostic test is 60% and 70% respectively. Hypercalcemia is seen in about 10%–13% of patients, whereas hypercalciuria is 3&#160;times more common. A chest radiograph, usually a high-&#173;resolution CT scan, is typically obtained because of the frequent pulmonary involvement associated with sarcoidosis. Gallium scanning is a sensitive but nonspecific indicator of active inflammation in patients with sarcoidosis. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a sensitive method to assess inflammatory activity and the extent of disease; it is especially helpful in assessing persistently symptomatic patients without abnormal serologic signs. Histologic studies of involved conjunctiva, lacrimal glands, lymph nodes, or lungs may demonstrate noncaseating granulomas.</p>

			<p class="h3">Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) is an inherited mitochondrial myopathy characterized by slowly progressive, symmetric ophthalmoplegia with or without ptosis (Video 14-1; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-4</span>). The majority of patients with CPEO have mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions or point mutations, but nuclear DNA mutations can also cause CPEO. Thus, the mode of inheritance can be mitochondrial (maternal), autosomal, or sporadic (most common), and the disorder may not be transmissible to the next generation. Patients often initially present with ptosis and do not generally complain of diplopia. However, the majority of patients have visual impairment and difficulty with reading. At presentation, myasthenia gravis may be considered in the differential diagnosis, but in contrast to patients with CPEO, MG patients typically have variable signs and symptoms. Clinical findings usually develop in patients between 18–40&#160;years of age. Systemic symptoms may include generalized muscle weakness. Genetic testing is available for detection of abnormalities in the mtDNA. Histologic examination of muscle biopsy specimens shows the characteristic “ragged red fibers” (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-5</span>) and mitochondrial proliferation, and electron microscopic studies show inclusion body abnormalities of the affected mitochondria.</p>

			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Kearns-Sayre syndrome</span> is also an inherited mitochondrial myopathy. It includes CPEO, pigmentary retinopathy, and cardiac conduction abnormalities, and it variably includes cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and elevated CSF protein levels. Cardiac evaluation is essential to rule out conduction defects; this evaluation should be obtained for all patients with CPEO.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Oculopharyngeal dystrophy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Oculopharyngeal dystrophy is a hereditary condition, usually autosomal dominant, with onset in the fifth and sixth decades of life. The typical presentation is progressive bilateral ptosis followed by dysphagia and proximal muscle weakness. Most patients have an external ophthalmoplegia that, when asymmetric, may be accompanied by diplopia. Pathologic studies show a vacuolar myopathy. The disease is classically observed in patients of French Canadian ancestry. The only causative mutation described to date is a triplet repeat expansion consisting of 2–7&#160;additional base triplets in a repeat sequence in exon&#160;1 of the polyadenine binding protein, nuclear&#160;1 gene <span class="italic">(PABPN1),</span> located on chromosome&#160;14.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Myotonic dystrophy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Myotonic dystrophy, a dominantly inherited multisystem disorder, also produces ophthalmoplegia that may mimic CPEO. Two types have been identified: type&#160;1, resulting from mutation on chromosome&#160;19, and type&#160;2, resulting from mutation on chromosome&#160;3. Symptoms usually start in late childhood or early adulthood with myotonia that is exacerbated by excitement, cold, and fatigue. The myotonia can be easily detected by asking the patient to shake hands; the patient will not be able to quickly release his or her grasp. This myopathy is unusual in that it affects distal limb musculature first. Wasting of the temporalis and masseter muscles produces the typical “hatchet face.” The myopathic facies, frontal balding, and ptosis cause a distinct and remarkably characteristic appearance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular findings include ptosis, pigmentary retinopathy, ophthalmoparesis, and polychromatic lenticular deposits (“Christmas tree” cataracts). The pupils are miotic and respond sluggishly to light. Other features of this dystrophy include low intelligence, insulin resistance, hearing loss, cardiomyopathy, cardiac conduction abnormalities, testicular atrophy, and uterine atony. Electromyographic studies can demonstrate characteristic myotonic discharges, and genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neurocutaneous syndromes, or <span class="italic">phakomatoses,</span> are disorders characterized by the presence of hamartomas involving different organ systems, such as the skin, eyes, CNS, and viscera. Phakomatoses are inconsistently defined, and there is a lack of consensus about which conditions should be considered neurocutaneous syndromes. Four major disorders have traditionally been designated phakomatoses:</p>

			<p class="body-text">These disorders, which are discussed at length in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> are characterized by tumors formed from normal tissue elements: hamartomas and choristomas.

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-18">Selected Neuro-Ophthalmic Disorders Associated With Pregnancy</p>
				<div id="Chapt14_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">During pregnancy or the postpartum period, several neuro-&#173;ophthalmic abnormalities can be exacerbated or occur with greater frequency, including cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), pituitary apoplexy, and lymphocytic hypophysitis. CVT is discussed later in this chapter (see the section Cerebrovascular Disorders), and IIH and pituitary apoplexy are discussed in Chapter&#160;4. Preexisting pituitary macroadenomas, meningiomas, schwannomas, and orbital and choroidal hemangiomas can also undergo rapid expansion during pregnancy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A number of cranial neuropathies have been reported during pregnancy, most frequently involving the CN&#160;VII followed by the CN&#160;VI. These cranial neuropathies are thought to result from an increase in interstitial fluid around the nerve, causing compression. Hypercoagulopathy and hypertension have also been proposed as potential causes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Severe preeclampsia/eclampsia can lead to various ophthalmic manifestations, including serous retinal detachment, choroidal infarction, retinal vascular narrowing, and retinal artery vasospasm or occlusion. The optic nerve may become edematous secondary to systemic hypertension, intracranial hypertension, or ischemic optic neuropathy. Disorders of higher cortical function, such as alexia, simultagnosia, and cortical blindness have also been reported. In addition, PRES may develop in the context of preeclampsia/eclampsia (see the following section).</p>

			<p class="h2">Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">PRES is characterized by headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual disturbances (blurred vision, homonymous visual field loss, cortical blindness, photopsias, and visual hallucinations). MRI shows T2-hyperintense vasogenic edema involving the white matter of the cerebral posterior regions, especially the parieto-&#173;occipital lobes; however, the frontal and temporal lobes, basal ganglia, and brainstem may be involved as well (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-12</span>). A variety of conditions can predispose a patient to PRES; common causes include acute hypertension, preeclampsia/eclampsia, immunosuppressive drugs (eg, cyclosporine, <br />tacrolimus), renal disease, sepsis, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. It has been less commonly reported in patients with autoimmune disease. The abnormalities visible on neuroimaging are reversible, and the visual prognosis is usually excellent. The underlying pathophysiology of PRES remains elusive.</p>

			<p class="h2">Lymphocytic Hypophysitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lymphocytic hypophysitis is a rare neuroendocrine disorder characterized by autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary gland, with various degrees of pituitary dysfunction, including permanent hypopituitarism. Histologic findings consist of an initial monoclonal lymphocytic infiltrate, which can heal with minimal sequelae or progress to fibrosis. Ophthalmic manifestations include chiasmal visual field defects secondary to suprasellar extension or, less frequently, diplopia due to invasion of cavernous sinuses. Imaging characteristics and endocrine testing are not specific. The diagnosis should be suspected if a woman who is pregnant or in the peripartum period presents with headache, bitemporal visual field defects, and changes in 1 or more pituitary hormones. Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs may be needed in some patients. Surgical treatment is typically required if vision is compromised.</p>

			<p class="h1">Cerebrovascular Disorders</p>
				<div id="Chapt14_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although a comprehensive discussion of cerebrovascular disorders is beyond the scope of this text, the following sections give an overview of common conditions that cause neuro-&#173;ophthalmic signs and symptoms.</p>
			<p class="h2">Transient Visual Loss</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Transient neurologic or ophthalmic symptoms in middle-&#173;aged or elderly patients suggest a vascular origin. Localization of the symptoms and signs determines whether they result from ischemia in the vertebrobasilar or the carotid artery territory. Although recurrent cerebrovascular ischemia is a concern, the major cause of death in these patients is coronary artery disease. Thus, efforts should be made to control risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemias, accompanied by cessation of smoking. Diagnostic and therapeutic efforts are directed at the cerebrovascular circulation. Carotid system disorders whose main symptom is transient visual loss are discussed in Chapter&#160;5.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-19">Vertebrobasilar System Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vertebrobasilar arterial system (posterior circulation) is composed of the vertebral, basilar, and posterior cerebral arteries. These blood vessels supply the occipital cortex, brainstem, and cerebellum.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical presentation of vertebrobasilar insufficiency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with vertebrobasilar insufficiency often present to the ophthalmologist first, because ocular motor and visual symptoms are prominent (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-13</span>). Nonophthalmic symptoms of <span class="italic">transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)</span> in the vertebrobasilar system include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">ataxia, imbalance, or staggering</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">vertigo combined with other brainstem symptoms such as deafness or vomiting</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">transient dysarthria and dysphagia</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">hemiparesis, hemiplegia, and hemisensory disturbances</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">drop attacks (patient suddenly falls to the ground with no warning and no loss of consciousness)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Bilateral blurring or dimming of vision occurs almost as frequently as vertigo. The patient may report sudden bilateral graying or whiting out of vision. These episodes of dimming may last seconds to minutes and may be accompanied by flickering or flashing stars. Photopsias may occur, closely mimicking the scintillating scotomata of migraine. These attacks are frequently repetitive and may occur alone or in combination with the other transient symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Migraine (discussed in Chapter&#160;12) can produce similar symptoms, with or without an associated <br />headache.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Homonymous visual field changes without other neurologic symptoms suggest involvement of the posterior circulation. Highly congruous homonymous visual field defects without other systemic symptoms are typical of occipital lobe infarcts. Patients who report reading difficulties without an obvious cause should undergo a careful visual field and Amsler grid examination in search of centrally located congruous homonymous visual field defects.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chapter&#160;4 details the visual manifestations of cortical infarction. Cerebral and cortical blindness, caused by bilateral occipital lobe lesions, is characterized by amaurosis, normally reactive pupils, and an unremarkable fundus appearance. Frequently, patients with cerebral blindness will deny their blindness (Anton syndrome; see Chapter&#160;6).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular motor disturbances are common with vertebrobasilar insufficiency, and diplopia is a frequent complaint. Examination may reveal horizontal or vertical gaze palsies, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, skew deviation, ocular motor CN palsies, or nystagmus. An ipsilateral, central Horner syndrome may be present with pontine or medullary infarcts (Wallenberg syndrome).</p>

Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins; 2005:539–554.</p>
			<p class="h3">Etiologies of posterior circulation ischemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most frequent causes of vertebrobasilar TIAs and stroke are atheromatous occlusion, hypertensive vascular disease (lacunar infarction), microembolization (either from the vertebrobasilar system or from the heart), fluctuations in cardiac output, and arterial dissection. The following conditions have all been associated with symptoms and signs of vertebrobasilar ischemia: polycythemia, hypercoagulable states, anemia, vasospasm, and congenital aplasia or hypoplasia of a vertebral or posterior communicating artery. Mechanical factors such as cervical spondylosis and chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine have also been implicated in vertebrobasilar occlusions resulting in severe neurologic deficits. A less common cause of vertebrobasilar dysfunction is a reversal of blood flow in the vertebral artery <span class="italic">(subclavian steal);</span> this reversal is caused by a proximal occlusion of the subclavian artery that produces an unusual alteration in the direction of flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery. Lowered pressure in the distal segment of the subclavian artery can siphon, or “steal,” blood from the vertebral artery and produce fluctuating symptoms of vertebrobasilar artery insufficiency.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Investigation of posterior circulation ischemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The evaluation for posterior circulation ischemia is similar to the medical workup for carotid system disease. Neuroimaging is typically performed on all patients with homonymous visual field defects and other signs of brainstem or cerebellar dysfunction. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomographic arteriography (CTA) are the best noninvasive methods for evaluating the posterior circulation. Carotid Doppler imaging is not sufficient for evaluating suspected posterior circulation symptoms. Sometimes conventional angiography is necessary to visualize the aortic arch, the configuration of the vertebrobasilar vessels, and the extent of filling from the anterior circulation through the&#160;circle of Willis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinician is much less likely to find a treatable structural vascular abnormality with posterior circulation ischemia than with carotid system disease. The evaluation of these patients generally emphasizes a search for underlying cardiac or systemic disorders, including hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and postural hypotension. Cardiac evaluation should also include echocardiography.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Treatment of vertebrobasilar ischemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most patients with vertebrobasilar TIAs are treated with statins and antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulants. Intravascular stent placement can be used in select patients with symptomatic vertebrobasilar stenosis who have failed maximal medical therapy.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-20">Cerebral Aneurysms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cerebral aneurysms are localized dilations of the vessel wall. They are present in approximately 5% of the population but rarely become symptomatic before 20&#160;years of age. Cerebral aneurysms may be an isolated finding and are commonly associated with hypertension. Less common predisposing conditions include arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), coarctation of aorta, polycystic kidney disease, and connective tissue diseases (eg, fibromuscular dysplasia, Marfan syndrome, and Ehlers-&#173;Danlos syndrome). A familial occurrence is possible, and tobacco use is a risk factor. Among patients with cerebral aneurysm, 10% will have more than 1.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;14-14</span> shows possible locations for cerebral aneurysms. The most common type of intracranial aneurysm is the saccular, or “berry,” aneurysm that arises at arterial bifurcations. Of these aneurysms, 90% are supratentorial and 10% are infratentorial. Aneurysms arising from the internal carotid artery and basilar artery may produce neuro-&#173;ophthalmic manifestations. In general, aneurysms larger than 10&#160;mm are most likely to rupture. If they are 25&#160;mm or larger, they are termed “giant aneurysms.” Because high morbidity and mortality result from aneurysm rupture, early detection and surgical intervention can be life-&#173;saving.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Clinical presentation of cerebral aneurysms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Unruptured aneurysms, particularly giant aneurysms, may cause progressive neurologic dysfunction because of their mass effect. An ophthalmic artery aneurysm may cause a progressive unilateral optic neuropathy and ipsilateral periocular pain. Anterior communicating artery aneurysms may cause loss of vision by compressing the optic chiasm or optic tract. Aneurysms at the junction of the internal carotid and posterior communicating arteries cause an ipsilateral CN&#160;III palsy. Any complete CN&#160;III palsy with pupil involvement and any partial CN&#160;III palsy with or without pupil involvement should raise suspicion for an aneurysm and prompt immediate neuroimaging. Diagnostically, pain is not a helpful symptom, because it may occur with CN palsies from microvascular is&#173;chemia and may be absent with unruptured aneurysms. TIAs, cerebral infarction, and seizures may be caused by flow phenomena or distal embolization.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intracavernous carotid artery aneurysms typically produce a cavernous sinus syndrome. These aneurysms are often a fusiform enlargement (dolichoectasia) and not saccular. CNs&#160;III, IV, and&#160;VI and the ophthalmic branch of CN&#160;V are involved, singly or in combination. Because they are confined by the walls of the cavernous sinus, these aneurysms typically do not rupture, instead causing progressive neurologic dysfunction. Aneurysms in this location often produce facial pain and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of painful ophthalmoplegia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A ruptured aneurysm is a neurosurgical emergency. Patients exhibit symptoms and signs of subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The headache resulting from a ruptured aneurysm may be localized or generalized and is often described as “the worst of my life.” Nausea, vomiting, and neck stiffness signify meningeal irritation from subarachnoid blood. In rare cases, fever may be present. Elevated intracranial pressure may produce papilledema and CN&#160;VI palsies. Patients may be disoriented, lethargic, or comatose. Altered mental status is a poor prognostic sign.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular hemorrhage may accompany subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intraretinal, preretinal, subhyaloid, vitreous, subconjunctival, orbital, or optic nerve sheath hemorrhage may be present. Ocular hemorrhages are most likely produced when intracranial pressure in the optic nerve sheath exceeds ocular venous pressure, reducing ophthalmic venous drainage and causing venous rupture. The combination of vitreous and subarachnoid hemorrhage is called <span class="italic">Terson syndrome </span>(<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-15</span>). Many patients recall symptoms of a “sentinel bleed” before the major rupture. Transient or mild neurologic symptoms with headache are most commonly described.</p>
			<p class="h3">Diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Any patient suspected of harboring an aneurysm requires urgent neuroradiologic investigation. The specific type of study ordered varies, and the decision should involve the neuroradiologist (see Chapter&#160;2). </p>
			<p class="body-text">CTA is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis of clinically relevant aneurysms at most sites. MRI demonstrates most aneurysms larger than 5&#160;mm, and high-&#173;quality MRA can detect aneurysms as small as 3&#160;mm. CTA or MRA is useful to screen for unruptured aneurysms; both procedures are less expensive and associated with lower morbidity than conventional angiography (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-16</span>). However, if there is a high level of suspicion for aneurysm, a negative finding on MRA or CTA does not obviate the need for the “gold standard” evaluation using conventional cerebral arteriography.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CT is useful immediately after aneurysm rupture to detect the presence of intraparenchymal and subarachnoid blood. An enhanced CT scan can demonstrate large aneurysms, but CT alone is not an acceptable screening test for unruptured aneurysms. If subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected and the CT finding is negative, CTA or lumbar puncture is needed to confirm the presence of subarachnoid blood. However, a lumbar puncture should not be attempted in the presence of midline shift or evidence of cerebral (uncal) herniation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Prognosis for patients with cerebral aneurysms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Modern imaging technology (MRA and CTA) has dramatically increased the detection of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The risk of rupture is related to the size of the aneurysm. Aneurysms that are 7–12&#160;mm, 13–24&#160;mm, and 25&#160;mm or greater have a yearly rupture rate of 1.2%, 3.1%, and 8.6%, respectively. Once an aneurysm has ruptured, morbidity and mortality are high. The proportion of patients who die at the time of rupture is 30%. If untreated, another 33% die within 6&#160;months of rupture, and 15% more die within 10&#160;years. Many of those who survive suffer severe neurologic deficits.</p>

			<p class="h3">Treatment of cerebral aneurysms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of symptomatic aneurysms before rupture is ideal and should be performed without delay. Supportive treatment to stabilize the patient includes efforts to lower intracranial pressure (via hyperventilation or administration of mannitol), treat cerebral vasospasm (with calcium channel blockers and blood volume expansion), control blood pressure, and prevent seizures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The definitive treatment is surgical clipping of the aneurysm; however, endovascular techniques such as coil embolization or stent placement are replacing clipping as the preferred treatment for many aneurysms, depending on the aneurysm’s size, location, and anatomy.</p>

			<p class="h2">Arterial Dissection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dissections may develop in the internal carotid artery (ICA) or in any of its branches, as well as in the vertebral and basilar arteries. Dissection may arise either extracranially or intracranially. Risk factors for a dissection include trauma, cervical manipulation, connective tissue disorders, and fibromuscular dysplasia.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Clinical presentation of arterial dissection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Arterial dissection’s clinical features are variable. Patients may incur stroke, which typically occurs within the first 30&#160;days of the dissection. The most common presentation of ICA dissection is acute pain located on the ipsilateral forehead, around the orbit, or in the neck. Other manifestations include ipsilateral ophthalmic signs and contralateral neurologic deficits (see Chapter&#160;10, Fig&#160;10-4). A bruit may be present. Sometimes symptoms of arterial dissection are delayed for weeks or months after trauma. Transient or permanent neurologic symptoms and signs include amaurosis fugax, acute stroke, monocular vision loss, and ipsilateral Horner syndrome. If the dissection extends to the intracranial carotid segment, cranial neuropathies can occur, producing diplopia, dysgeusia, tongue paralysis, or facial numbness.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The vision loss associated with ICA dissection may be a result of embolic occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, central retinal artery, short posterior ciliary arteries, or retinal branch arteries. Alternatively, ophthalmic artery occlusion may be caused by the dissection itself. Reduced blood flow from ICA dissection is a rare cause of ocular ischemic syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The vertebral and basilar arteries are affected in 40% of dissections. General features of these dissections are headache, neck pain, and signs of brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. Ocular motor CN palsies are common, and the consequences may progress to include quadriplegia, coma, and death.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Diagnosis of arterial dissection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">MRI is the diagnostic test of choice for an extracranial ICA dissection. MRI shows a false lumen or an area of clotting in the cervical portion of the carotid artery (“crescent moon” sign; see Fig&#160;10-4) and may identify areas of brain infarction. CTA or MRI/MRA has a sensitivity of 87%–100%. CTA has the added benefit of allowing visualization of the vertebrobasilar system. Digital subtraction angiography may also be used for diagnosis. Ultrasonography is not sufficient to detect a carotid dissection and can elicit a false-&#173;negative result in nearly one-&#173;third of cases.</p>
			<p class="h3">Treatment of arterial dissection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The treatment of arterial dissection depends on the extent and location of the dissection and the patient’s overall condition. Treatment methods may include medical therapy using antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants, endovascular therapy with stent placement, and, in rare cases, surgery with bypass procedures.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Arteriovenous Malformations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Like aneurysms, AVMs are usually congenital and may be familial. Symptoms typically arise before 30&#160;years of age, with a slight male preponderance, and 6% of patients also have an intracranial aneurysm. Intracranial hemorrhage with or without subarachnoid hemorrhage is the initial presentation in half of the cases. In contrast to patients with saccular aneurysms, patients with AVMs are much more likely to become symptomatic before a hemorrhage occurs (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-17</span>). Seizures are the first manifestation in 30% of affected patients, whereas 20% have headaches or other focal neurologic deficits initially. The neurologic symptoms may be progressive or transient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Of the 90% of AVMs that are supratentorial, about 70% are cortical and 20% are deep. The remaining 10% of AVMs are located in the posterior fossa or dura mater. Early mortality occurs in up to 20% of cases when bleeding takes place, and the rebleeding rate is 2.5% each year. Most AVMs bleed into the brain, causing headaches and focal neurologic deficits.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An AVM’s neuro-&#173;ophthalmic manifestations depend on its location. Cortical AVMs in the occipital lobe may produce visual symptoms and headaches that resemble migraine. The visual phenomena are usually brief and unformed; typical migrainous scintillating scotomata may occur but are rare (see Chapter&#160;12, Fig&#160;12-1). Hemispheric AVMs may produce homonymous visual field defects. Signs and symptoms of brainstem AVMs are not specific and may include diplopia, nystagmus, dizziness, ocular motor nerve palsy, gaze palsy, anisocoria, or pupillary light–near dissociation. Reports of transient monocular visual loss caused by a steal phenomenon from an intracranial AVM are rare.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some patients with AVMs report a subjective intracranial bruit, and occasionally the examiner will detect a bruit via auscultation of the skull over the AVM.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Abnormal arterial communication with one of the dural venous sinuses (dural AVM) results in elevated venous pressure and, in turn, increased intracranial pressure. Dural AVMs account for 10%–15% of intracranial AVMs. Patients often have tinnitus and an audible bruit in addition to signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Dural AVMs are difficult to diagnose without catheter angiography and may be mistaken for typical IIH (see Chapter&#160;4). Dural AVMs should be considered if the patient does not fit the usual IIH demographics and has no other demonstrable cause of increased intracranial pressure.</p>
			<p class="h3">Diagnosis of arteriovenous malformations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If bleeding is suspected, an unenhanced CT scan will show the hemorrhage. Although unruptured AVMs are typically apparent on an enhanced CT scan, MRI is more sensitive for visualizing small AVMs. MRI demonstrates the heterogeneous signals representing the various elements of the lesion: blood vessels, brain, flowing and clotted blood, calcium, hemorrhage, or edema. Calcified AVMs are sometimes identifiable on plain radiograph or CT scan. Cerebral angiography is required to show the anatomy clearly and to define the feeding and draining vessels of the AVM.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Treatment of arteriovenous malformations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The location of the AVM, the anatomy of the feeding and draining vessels, and the size <br />of the lesion all affect the choice of treatment. The treatment modalities, including surgical resection, ligation of feeding vessels, embolization, and stereotactic radiosurgery, can be used alone or in combination. Seizures usually improve with anticonvulsant therapy.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Cerebral Venous Thrombosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Occlusion of the cortical and subcortical veins causes focal neurologic symptoms and signs, including neuro-&#173;ophthalmic findings. Most commonly affected are the cavernous sinus, lateral (transverse) sinus, and superior sagittal sinus; each produces a distinct clinical syndrome. During pregnancy, the lateral and superior sagittal sinuses are more commonly affected. Patients with thrombosis may present with headaches and papil&#173;ledema, and the thrombosis could be confused with IIH. Thrombosis of the deep veins may cause infarction of the thalamus or basal ganglia, and death can occur in 3%–15% of cases.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Types of cerebral venous thrombosis</p>
			<p class="h5-text ParaOverride-21"><span class="h4-head">Cavernous sinus thrombosis</span> Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) in the <span class="italic">septic</span> form results from an infection of the face, oral cavity, or sphenoid or ethmoidal sinuses. Otitis media or orbital cellulitis is a rare cause. Patients experience headache, nausea, vomiting, and somnolence. There may also be fever, chills, tachycardia, evidence of meningitis, or generalized sepsis. Ocular signs from anterior infection (facial, dental, or orbital) are initially unilateral but frequently become bilateral. These signs include orbital congestion, lacrimation, conjunctival edema, eyelid swelling, ptosis, proptosis, and ophthalmoplegia. CN&#160;VI palsy is the most consistent early neurologic sign. Corneal anesthesia, facial numbness, Horner syndrome, and venous stasis retinopathy can occur. Septic CST is a medical emergency; it carries a high mortality rate if it is not recognized promptly and if treatment is not initiated immediately. The mainstay of therapy is early and aggressive antibiotic administration. Anticoagulation is often recommended as adjunctive therapy. Corticosteroids may help to reduce inflammation and edema. If feasible, the primary source of infection should be drained.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The signs and symptoms of <span class="italic">aseptic</span> CST resemble those of septic CST, but clinical or laboratory examination shows no evidence of infection. Pain around the eye is common, but orbital congestion is typically less severe than with septic CST. Anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is often used.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-17"><span class="h4-head">Lateral (transverse) sinus thrombosis</span> Lateral sinus thrombosis may be septic or spontaneous (see Chapter&#160;2, Fig&#160;2-13). With the widespread use of antibiotics, septic thrombosis has become rare, but it may result from otitis media.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with lateral sinus thrombosis have features of systemic infection as well as neck pain, tenderness of the ipsilateral jugular vein, retroauricular edema, and sometimes, facial weakness. Severe facial pain also may occur; when accompanied by CN&#160;VI palsy it is called <span class="italic">Gradenigo syndrome.</span> Lateral sinus thrombosis is much more likely to be spontaneous and produce an IIH-like syndrome with increased intracranial pressure. The most common ophthalmic signs are papilledema and CN&#160;VI palsy.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis</span> The most commonly involved cerebral venous sinus is the superior sagittal sinus (SSS); symptoms of its thrombosis depend on the extent and location of the occlusion. With thrombosis of the anterior third of the sinus, symptoms are mild or absent. Posterior SSS thrombosis may produce a clinical picture similar to that of IIH, with headaches and papilledema. It is a diagnosis to consider in atypical IIH patients, such as slim women and men. Seizures and motor deficits may occur.</p>
			<p class="h3">Diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neuroimaging is required to diagnose CVT. CT or MRI is often used initially, but a targeted venographic study, such as magnetic resonance venography (MRV) or computed tomography venography (CTV) should also be considered. Cerebral venography may be used in cases in which clinical suspicion is high despite normal CTV or MRV findings.</p>
			<p class="h3">Laboratory evaluation of cerebral venous thrombosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prothrombotic conditions are present in 21%–34% of patients with CVT, most commonly protein&#160;C deficiency, protein&#160;S deficiency, presence of antiphospholipid and anti&#173;cardiolipin antibodies, factor&#160;V Leiden, presence of prothrombin G20210A mutation, and hyperhomocysteinemia. Other predisposing factors include pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives, and systemic conditions including cancer, facial infections, inflammatory diseases, and hematologic diseases.</p>
			<p class="h3">Treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of CVT is directed toward the underlying condition. Therapies include use of anticoagulants, fibrinolytic drugs, and treatments to lower intracranial pressure. Antiepileptic drugs are used for patients with seizures. Corticosteroids are typically not used in CVT treatment unless required for management of the underlying inflammatory disease. Endovascular interventional therapy using modern approaches to intracranial recanalization may be needed in symptomatic patients showing resistance to medical treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with CVT may benefit from receiving care in a dedicated hospital stroke unit to ensure adequate treatment and to prevent complications.</p>

This syndrome mainly affects middle-&#173;aged women, and more than one-half of RCVS cases occur during the postpartum period or after exposure to vasoactive substances (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, triptans, amphetamines, ergotamine, nasal decongestants, or cannabis). Although the syndrome may be self-&#173;limited and benign, it may lead to ischemic stroke or nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. MRA or conventional angiography may demonstrate the characteristic “string-of-beads” appearance of the cerebral arteries. Calcium channel blockers are the standard therapies, but these have no proven effect on the syndrome’s hemorrhagic and ischemic complications (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-18</span>).</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neuro-ophthalmic disorders associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may result either from direct infection or from indirect causes such as secondary opportunistic infections, malignancy, microvasculopathy, or uveitis. The eye, afferent visual pathways, and ocular motor system can all be affected. BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> discusses the following conditions in detail.</p>
                <p class="h3">Human immunodeficiency virus</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">HIV infection causes acute and chronic CNS manifestations. Acute aseptic meningitis and meningoencephalitis affect 5%–10% of patients, soon after initial HIV infection. Headache, fever, and meningeal signs may accompany a mononucleosis-&#173;like syndrome. Occasionally, altered mental status, seizures, optic neuropathy, and cranial neuropathies occur, most commonly CN&#160;VII paresis.</p>

Abnormal pursuit, saccadic eye movements, and saccadic intrusions (square-wave jerks) may be present. Late manifestations include profound dementia, behavior changes, psychosis, psychomotor impairment, weakness, visual neglect, visual hallucinations, seizures, and tremor. An optic neuropathy may develop. MRI demonstrates cerebral atrophy and areas of white matter hyperintensity on T2-weighted images that correspond to areas of demyelination produced by the virus.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Ocular signs of HIV infection include cotton-wool spots, perivasculitis, and retinal hemorrhages.

CNS lymphoma can cause diplopia from CN&#160;III, IV, or&#160;VI involvement. Lymphomatous infiltration of the orbit and optic nerve may lead to ONH swelling and vision loss. The diagnosis is made by confirming the presence of neoplastic lymphomatous cells in the CSF or through results of stereotactic brain or meningeal biopsy. Changes shown on MRI scan may resemble those of toxoplasmosis, but they are typically periventricular with subependymal spread. Treatment consists of a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a common opportunistic infection and a major cause of vision loss in HIV-&#173;infected patients. CMV retinitis is often the presenting manifestation of untreated advanced HIV infection and primarily occurs in patients with extremely low CD4<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> T-lymphocyte cell counts. Within the CNS, CMV infection causes optic neuritis and brainstem encephalitis. Anterior optic nerve infection produces acute loss of vision with ONH swelling; this condition usually occurs in patients with severe CMV retinitis. Other patients exhibit anterior optic neuropathy with minimal retinitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-19</span>). Posterior optic neuropathy, which is rare, is characterized by slowly progressive loss of vision without ONH edema.

See BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span></p>
                <p class="body-text">The most common neurologic manifestation of herpes infection is CNS encephalitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-20</span>). Radiculitis may occur, producing Ramsay Hunt syndrome (see Chapter&#160;11) and herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). Neuro-&#173;ophthalmic complications of HZO include ischemic optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, and ocular motor CN&#160;palsy. In the majority of cases, HZO-&#173;induced ophthalmoplegia occurs within 2&#160;weeks of onset of the HZO rash. Treatment with oral antiviral therapy and oral corticosteroids is usually recommended. This self-&#173;limiting ophthalmoplegia improves over the course of several months; the majority of patients recover from the diplopia, at least in primary gaze.</p>

Cerebral infarction can result from obliterative endarteritis. Neuroimaging studies may show hydrocephalus, abscess formation, granulomas, and enhancement of the basal meninges with contrast administration. Ethambutol is used along with other medications to treat mycobacterial infection; toxicity from this medication can cause bilateral, progressive, painless vision loss (see Chapter&#160;4).</p>

                <p class="h2">Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Originally described in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and impaired cell-&#173;mediated immunity, PML occurs in 1%–4% of HIV-&#173;infected patients. PML has also been reported in patients with MS who have been treated with immunomodulating medications such as natalizumab. The disease is caused by the JC virus, a polyomavirus that infects oligodendrocytes. Gray matter is relatively spared. The central visual pathways and ocular motor fibers can be affected. Neuro-&#173;ophthalmic manifestations include homonymous hemianopia, blurred vision, cerebral blindness, prosopagnosia, and diplopia. Other neurologic findings are altered mental status, ataxia, dementia, hemiparesis, and focal deficits. Behavioral and cognitive abnormalities are very common.</p>
                <p class="body-text">MRI scan shows areas of demyelination, most frequently in the parieto-&#173;occipital region. PML typically involves the subcortical white matter, with focal or confluent nonenhancing lesions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-21</span>). Therapy is aimed at correcting the underlying immune deficiency state, and prognosis is poor. In some cases, plasma exchange may be <br />helpful.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of infectious posterior uveitis in adults and children. The ocular manifestations, which are common, are extensively discussed in BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span></p>
                <p class="body-text">CNS toxoplasmosis is often associated with immune deficiency. Toxoplasmic optic neuritis is rare, characterized by subacute visual loss and ONH swelling, at times accompanied by a macular star (neuroretinitis). CNS toxoplasmosis produces multifocal lesions, with a predilection for the basal ganglia and the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Patients experience headaches, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, mental status changes, and fever. Neuro-&#173;ophthalmic findings include homonymous hemianopia and quadrantanopia, ocular motor CN palsies, and gaze palsies. Long-term antitoxoplasmosis treatment is necessary to prevent recurrences.</p>
                <p class="body-text">MRI typically shows multiple lesions that are isointense with the brain on T1-weighted images and isointense or hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Gadolinium administration reveals enhancement.</p>

                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lyme borreliosis is caused by infection with <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi,</span> a spirochete transmitted by deer ticks. The disease, which typically occurs in 3&#160;stages, can produce ocular and neuro-&#173;ophthalmic manifestations. Lyme disease is discussed further in BCSC Section&#160;1, <span class="italic">Update on General Medicine,</span> and Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span></p>
                <p class="body-text">Along with various uveitic entities, neuro-&#173;ophthalmic findings occur primarily in <span class="italic">stage&#160;2</span> and include papilledema (IIH-like syndrome), optic neuritis, papillitis, neuroretinitis, and orbital myositis. Two-thirds of patients have ocular findings at this stage. Cranial neuropathies can occur, most commonly CN&#160;VII palsy, as well as radiculopathies and meningitis with headache and neck stiffness.</p>
                <p class="body-text">In <span class="italic">stage&#160;3,</span> neurologic conditions (neuroborreliosis) predominate, including chronic encephalomyelitis, spastic paraparesis, ataxic gait, subtle mental disorders, and chronic radiculopathy. The neurologic picture may resemble that of MS, clinically and radiographically. In rare instances, Lyme can cause repeat cerebrovascular events in multiple locations within short time intervals.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The diagnosis is made clinically when the patient has been exposed to an endemic area (the patient might not recall a tick bite) and shows the typical rash of erythema chronicum migrans (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-22</span>). The presence of an elevated Lyme antibody titer in the serum or CSF is helpful. The enzyme-&#173;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is typically used for screening, but a positive result using the Western blot technique confirms the diagnosis.</p>

                <p class="h2">Fungal Infections</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The 2&#160;main types of fungi are molds and yeasts, although some fungi can have characteristics of both. Molds (filamentous fungi) are composed of hyphae, which extend and branch to form a mycelium, enabling the mold to grow. Molds reproduce when a portion of the hyphae breaks off. Aspergillosis and mucormycosis are CNS infections caused by molds. Yeasts are round, with outpouchings called buds or pseudohyphae. They are septated and reproduce by budding: the parent cell divides and one of the daughter nuclei migrates into a bud on the surface of a cell. Coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis are caused by yeasts. Candida can grow as a yeast or a mold.</p>
                <p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Aspergillosis</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most frequent mode of transmission of <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> species is inhalation of spores. The 3&#160;main types of infections are allergic aspergillosis, aspergillomas, and invasive aspergillosis. Allergic aspergillosis affects the bronchopulmonary system and the paranasal sinuses. Allergic <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> sinusitis occurs in immunocompetent patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis. It can invade the orbit, especially with sphenoid sinus involvement, and can result in secondary optic neuropathy, proptosis, diplopia, and retrobulbar pain. Aspergillomas, or fungus balls, may arise in the orbit, paranasal sinuses, or brain. They can occur in either immunocompromised or immunocompetent patients. Orbital aspergillomas produce symptoms of orbital masses, with proptosis, vision loss, diplopia, and pain. Orbital lesions also typically involve the sinuses or brain. Extension to the optic canal, cavernous sinus, optic nerves, and optic chiasm produces neuro-&#173;ophthalmic findings (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-23</span>). Intracranial aspergillomas act like mass lesions, causing progressive neurologic deficits. Invasive aspergillosis typically occurs in immunocompromised patients; however, the disease can also affect immunocompetent patients. Most patients initially have pulmonary involvement, although the skin, orbit, or sinuses may be the nidus of infection. CNS infection occurs secondarily by either direct or hematogenous spread of organisms. Ophthalmic manifestations include acute retrobulbar optic neuropathy, endophthalmitis, orbital apex syndrome, and cavernous sinus syndrome. The presentation of invasive aspergillosis is highly variable and can mimic malignancy, idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome, GCA, and bacterial cellulitis. Vascular invasion produces cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Meningitis, intracranial abscess, epidural and subdural hematoma, mycotic aneurysm formation, and encephalitis are serious sequelae of invasive aspergillosis.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Treatment includes antifungal agents such voriconazole, itraconazole, or posaconazole. Voriconazole may be associated with transient visual disturbances. Surgical intervention is often necessary to treat aspergillomas and invasive aspergillosis. The mortality rate for invasive aspergillosis varies from 40%–80%, depending on predisposing risk factors.</p>

                <p class="h3">Zygomycosis</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Zygomycetes (genera <span class="italic">Mucor</span> or <span class="italic">Rhizopus</span>) are ubiquitous organisms that typically have low virulence, except in debilitated hosts. The mold enters the body through the respiratory tract and proliferates, causing hyphal invasion of tissues. It grows rapidly, producing a more acute infection than other fungi. These organisms have a predilection for blood vessels; hemorrhage, thrombosis, and ischemic necrosis are hallmarks of the disease. Aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm formation in the intracranial vasculature can produce devastating consequences when rupture occurs. The 2&#160;types of zygomycosis (also known as <span class="italic">mucormycosis</span> or <span class="italic">phycomycosis</span>) that result in ophthalmic involvement are rhinocerebral zygomycosis and CNS zygomycosis.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Rhinocerebral zygomycosis usually occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus, patients taking corticosteroids, or neutropenic patients receiving antibiotics. The initial infection spreads from the facial skin, nasal mucosa, paranasal sinuses, or hard palate (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-24</span>). The fungus spreads to the nearby blood vessels, affecting the orbital vessels, carotid arteries, cavernous sinuses, or jugular veins. Orbital and neurologic signs are produced by infarction, thrombosis, or hemorrhage. If untreated, rhinocerebral zygomycosis may bring about rapid deterioration, leading to death within days. A few patients may have a chronic course with little indication of systemic illness. The most common signs and symptoms include fever, nasal necrosis, periorbital swelling, decreased vision, ophthalmoplegia, sinusitis, and headache. Retinal infarction, ophthalmic artery occlusion, and optic nerve infiltration are mechanisms of blindness. Neurologic signs include hemiparesis, aphasia, seizures, and altered mental status.</p>
                <p class="body-text">CNS zygomycosis is very rare. The fungus usually gains access into the CNS from the nose or paranasal sinus, but there is no nasal, sinus, ocular, or orbital disease when the <br />neurologic manifestations appear. Infection of the orbit, palate, nose, and sinuses typically occurs secondarily. Meningitis, abscesses, CN involvement, and seizures are common.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The diagnosis of zygomycosis requires a high index of suspicion. CT scan may demonstrate bone destruction, soft-&#173;tissue alteration in the paranasal sinuses and orbit, air–fluid levels in the sinuses and orbits, or brain abscess formation. MRI, MRA, and arteriography may be helpful for demonstrating vascular thrombosis. The definitive test is a biopsy specimen that demonstrates vascular invasion, tissue necrosis, eschar formation, inflammatory cells, and nonseptate hyphae (by histologic examination).</p>
                <p class="body-text">Zygomycosis has a high mortality rate, although prompt diagnosis and aggressive therapy may be life-&#173;saving. The underlying systemic disease should be treated and immunosuppressant agents eliminated, if possible. Therapy includes aggressive surgical debridement of necrotic tissue and administration of antifungal agents both locally and systemically. Hyperbaric oxygen has been used as adjuvant therapy.</p>

                <p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Cryptococcosis</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused mainly by <span class="italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> and <span class="italic">Cryptococcus gattii.</span> Inhalation of these fungi and subsequent pulmonary infection may spread to the CNS, causing meningitis or meningoencephalitis. Although <span class="italic">C&#160;neoformans,</span> which<span class="italic"> </span>is found in pigeon droppings and contaminated soil, is ubiquitous, it rarely causes infection in otherwise healthy people. Affected individuals are typically immunocompromised, predominantly patients with HIV infection or AIDS. <span class="italic">C&#160;gattii</span> typically grows in soil around various kinds of trees; it can produce severe meningoencephalitis as well as pulmonary disease in immunocompromised or immunocompetent individuals.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The most common neuro-&#173;ophthalmic abnormality is papilledema from cryptococcal meningitis. Retrobulbar optic neuritis may also be present with gradual loss of vision over hours to days. Other ophthalmic complications include retinochoroiditis and cotton-&#173;wool spots. Cranial neuropathies may be observed, including unilateral or bilateral CN&#160;VI palsies. Photophobia, blurred vision, retrobulbar pain, homonymous visual field defects, or nystagmus may occur. The onset of symptoms is usually insidious, with a waxing and waning course. Headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and mental status changes are the most common complaints.</p>
                <p class="body-text">The diagnosis is confirmed by isolating the yeast in the CSF or by demonstrating the capsular antigen for <span class="italic">C neoformans</span> or <span class="italic">C gattii</span>. In most patients with CNS cryptococcosis the disease is disseminated; there is evidence of infection in the blood, lungs, bone marrow, skin, kidneys, and other organs. Serum antigen titers are helpful for this reason.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Antifungal treatment should be initiated urgently, and aggressive management of intracranial hypertension is often needed. Vision loss caused by papilledema may be treated with CSF shunting or optic nerve sheath fenestration. The mortality rate of patients with treated CNS cryptococcosis is 25%–30%. The prognosis is worse in patients with an underlying malignancy or AIDS.</p>

                <p class="h2">Prion Diseases</p>
                <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prion diseases, also known as <span class="italic">transmissible spongiform encephalopathies,</span> include kuru in New Guinea; sporadic Creutzfeldt-&#173;Jakob disease (sCJD), which is found worldwide; familial CJD (fCJD); and variant CJD (vCJD), which is found mostly in the United Kingdom and France. Variant CJD has been linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“mad cow” disease), which is a prion disease in cattle. Other rare types of prion diseases include fatal insomnia <br />(a rare hereditary disorder that causes difficulty sleeping) and Gerstmann-&#173;Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (an extremely rare disorder that typically occurs around age&#160;40).</p>
                <p class="body-text">Prions are infectious agents formed by the conversion of a normal cell surface protein (PrP<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">C</span>) to a misfolded cell surface protein called PrP<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">CJD</span> or PrP<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">SC</span> (“SC” stands for the animal prion disease scrapie). sCJD may result from somatic mutation in the prion protein gene or, more likely, from the spontaneous, random conversion of a normal prion protein to an abnormal prion protein and the subsequent expansion of the altered form. About 10% of CJD cases are familial, resulting from inherited mutations in the <span class="italic">PrP</span> gene.</p>
                <p class="body-text">CJD is uniformly fatal, presenting as a rapidly progressive dementia culminating in death, usually within 8&#160;months. The most commonly reported visual manifestations include diplopia, supranuclear palsies, complex visual disturbances, homonymous visual field defects, hallucinations, and cortical blindness. In the Heidenhain variant of CJD, patients present primarily with isolated visual symptoms. Due to the complex clinical manifestations, this rare but clinically distinct group of patients with sCJD may be a diagnostic dilemma. Diffusion-&#173;weighted and FLAIR MRI may reveal early cortical changes and PET scan may reveal hypometabolism in posterior cortical regions.</p>
                <p class="body-text">Diagnostic testing for prion disease includes MRI, electroencephalogram (EEG), lumbar puncture, and possibly brain biopsy. Diffusion-weighted MRI images show typical high-&#173;intensity caudate and/or putamen lesions. The EEG shows characteristic periodic sharp wave complexes. CSF usually contains the 14-3-3 protein, and brain histologic studies reveal spongiform degeneration. No treatment is currently available.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-13">Radiation Therapy</p>
				<div id="Chapt14_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several types of radiation therapy (RT) are currently available, and techniques continue to evolve and emerge with scientific advances. Traditional whole-brain RT, which is used to treat cerebral malignancies, is delivered in fractions over approximately 4–6&#160;weeks. In 3-dimensional conformal RT, a computer helps concentrate radiation in a precise area; this concentration is accomplished through the use of complex asymmetric 3-dimensional shapes. Radiation surgery (radiosurgery) refers to linear accelerator or gamma knife techniques, which are distinct from traditional fractionated RT. Radiosurgery is typically given in a single sitting, using computer-&#173;based techniques to focus radiation at the desired regions. These techniques may treat malignancies, occasional inflammatory lesions, and vascular malformations. Tumors in very close proximity to the anterior visual pathway structures may not be suitable targets for single-&#173;fraction radiosurgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Complications resulting from RT directed at the CNS may take several forms and can occur years after therapy. Immediate complications include transient swelling of the involved tissue. Later complications of neuro-&#173;ophthalmic interest include radiation necrosis, cranial neuropathies, and ocular neuromyotonia (see Chapter&#160;7). Radiation necrosis involves death of nervous system tissue with attendant edema. This complication may simulate the imaging appearance of recurrent neoplasm on traditional MRI or CT imaging. Occasionally, functional imaging techniques such as PET or magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are required to separate these entities radiographically; neoplasms generally display a hypermetabolic profile, whereas radiation necrosis is hypometabolic in nature.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Of greater concern to the neuro-&#173;ophthalmologist is radiation optic neuropathy (RON). This rare complication typically occurs months after radiation administration and produces subacute optic neuropathy. RON is in part dose-&#173;related; it is more likely to occur with higher doses (often &gt;5000&#160;cGy). MRI studies of RON usually demonstrate enhancement of the optic nerve(s) on the postcontrast, T1-weighted sequences (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-25</span>). Hyperbaric oxygen, corticosteroids, pentoxifylline, and intravenous or intravitreal bevacizumab have all been used for the treatment of RON. Thus far there is only anecdotal evidence regarding the effectiveness of such treatments.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy (SMART) is a syndrome related to delayed complications resulting from brain irradiation for CNS malignancies, typically occurring many years after radiation therapy. Patients present with recurrent attacks of complex neurologic signs and symptoms, including headache, visual disturbances, and seizures. Debilitating stroke-like deficits such as homonymous hemianopia, hemiplegia, and/or aphasia typically resolve over an average of 2&#160;months; however, in some cases, the neurologic recovery is incomplete. MRI findings include unilateral increased T2&#160;signal within the temporal, parietal, or occipital cortices with pronounced gyral cortical gray matter enhancement. As symptoms resolve, the MRI findings disappear.</p>
