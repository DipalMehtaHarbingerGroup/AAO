			<p class="part-intro--title-">Introduction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Basic and Clinical Science Course has undergone continuous evolution since its inception. These volumes originated as a topic outline with suggested reading lists, including primary and secondary sources for each topic. In recent years, the books have grown into far more detailed reviews of each of the ophthalmic subspecialties, taking on many of the attributes of textbooks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Section 5, <span class="CharOverride-1">Neuro-Ophthalmology,</span> has likewise evolved. In 2001, the text was reorganized to take a symptom-driven approach, focusing on how to approach patients with neuro-ophthalmic complaints. The emphasis is on the examination of the patient—both basic and extended—and the appropriate use of adjunctive studies to determine the status of the patient’s visual system as a whole. With this edition, we hope the reader will find the content to be improved in terms of both the approach to the diagnosis and to the management of a patient with neuro-ophthalmic disease. We have also continued to revise and update the content, illustrative material (figures), tables, and references. One particularly significant modification for this edition is Chapter 8’s title change from “The Patient With Diplopia” to “The Patient With Abnormal Ocular Motility or Diplopia.” This title change reflects that not all patients with abnormal ocular motility will have diplopia, and that not all patients with diplopia will have abnormal eye movements. In addition, Chapters 7 and 8 switched position from the previous edition; “The Patient With Supranuclear Disorders of Ocular Motility” now follows “The Patient With Abnormal Ocular Motility or Diplopia.” These chapters were swapped so that the reader will now read an introduction on the basic concepts of eye movements and examination findings prior to delving into the potentially daunting task of understanding supranuclear ocular motility disorders and nystagmus (Chapter 9). </p>
			<p class="body-text">This book is in no way meant to be an all-encompassing or comprehensive treatise; thus, we have included a list of some of the more useful secondary sources of information, as well as references with primary source material. As with all the prior major revisions, we have endeavored to make this book more readable as well as clinically relevant and hope that it will help to instill confidence in ophthalmologists to approach patients with common clinical neuro-ophthalmic problems.</p>

			<p class="chapter-title">Neuro-Ophthalmic Anatomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Medical practice in general—and surgical subspecialties in particular—is an exercise in applied anatomy. Although an adequate understanding of physiology and, increasingly, molecular genetics is important in understanding disease and potential treatments, anatomy is the foundation. The anatomy of the globe and adnexal structures is covered in more detail in BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology;</span> Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System;</span> and Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span> This chapter outlines the intracranial pathways subserving the afferent and efferent visual pathways. It also briefly discusses the sensory and motor anatomy of the face and the autonomic nervous system as applied to the eye and visual system.</p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Bony Anatomy</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top1">
			<p class="h2-h1">Skull Base</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The skull base has an intimate relationship with visually essential structures (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-1</span>). The skull base is connected to the lower facial skeleton by 3&#160;sets of pillars formed by the <span class="italic">maxillary</span> and <span class="italic">zygomatic bones</span> anteriorly and the <span class="italic">pterygoid process</span> of the sphenoid bone posteriorly. Superiorly, the vault of the skull is made up of the <span class="italic">parietal bones,</span> which meet at the <span class="italic">sagittal suture;</span> the <span class="italic">frontal bone,</span> which adjoins them at the <span class="italic">coronal suture;</span> and the occipital bone, which meets the parietal bones at the <span class="italic">lambdoid suture.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">sella turcica,</span> located posteriorly and medially to the 2&#160;orbits, is a skull-based depression within the body of the <span class="italic">sphenoid bone.</span> The lesser wing of the sphenoid bone is pierced by the <span class="italic">optic canal,</span> which allows the optic nerves to exit from the orbit. The <span class="italic">superior orbital fissure,</span> which transmits the ocular motor cranial nerves (CNs) (oculomotor nerve or CN&#160;III, trochlear nerve or CN&#160;IV, and abducens nerve or CN&#160;VI), the ophthalmic division of the sensory trigeminal nerve (CN&#160;V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>), the sympathetic fibers, and the superior ophthalmic vein (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-2</span>), represents the gap between the lesser and greater wings of the sphenoid bone. The parasellar region is connected laterally to the <span class="italic">petrous</span> and <span class="italic">temporal bones</span> and inferiorly to the <span class="italic">clivus,</span> extending to the <span class="italic">foramen magnum</span> and the exit of the spinal cord. The posterior skull base is enclosed by the <span class="italic">occipital bones.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">The Orbit</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The orbit—connected posteriorly to the parasellar region—makes up the anterior aspect of the skull and is composed of 7&#160;craniofacial bones (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-3</span>):</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">&#9;1.&#9;maxillary</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;2.&#9;zygomatic</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;3.&#9;frontal</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;4.&#9;lacrimal</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;5.&#9;sphenoid</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;6.&#9;palatine</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">&#9;7.&#9;ethmoidal</p>
			<p class="body-text">The orbit is approximately 45&#160;mm wide and 35&#160;mm in maximal height. The total volume of the orbit is approximately 30&#160;cm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>. The medial wall is approximately 40&#160;mm from the rim to the optic canal. The medial walls are roughly parallel, whereas the lateral walls form an angle of almost 90°. The orbital rim is made up of the <span class="italic">frontal bone</span> superiorly, which connects to the <span class="italic">zygomatic bone</span> (at the <span class="italic">frontozygomatic suture</span>) laterally. The inferior orbital rim is made up of the zygomatic bone inferolaterally and the maxillary bone inferonasally (meeting at the <span class="italic">zygomaticomaxillary suture</span>). Medially, the orbital rim consists of the <span class="italic">maxillary</span> and <span class="italic">lacrimal bones,</span> which join the frontal bone superiorly. An additional 3 bones contribute to the orbit: (1)&#160;the <span class="italic">ethmoidal bone</span> medially, (2)&#160;the <span class="italic">palatine bone</span> inferiorly in the posterior orbit, and (3)&#160;the <span class="italic">sphenoid bone</span> laterally and superiorly in the orbital apex.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The orbit is surrounded by several important structures. The 4&#160;<span class="italic">paranasal sinuses</span> surround the floor <span class="italic">(maxillary sinus)</span> and the medial wall <span class="italic">(ethmoidal</span> and <span class="italic">sphenoid sinuses)</span> of the orbit (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-4</span>). The <span class="italic">frontal sinus</span> has a variable relationship to the anterior orbital roof. The other major structures around the orbit are the <span class="italic">anterior cranial fossa</span> superiorly (containing the frontal lobe) and the <span class="italic">temporal fossa</span> laterally (containing the temporalis muscle). The roof of the <span class="italic">ethmoidal complex,</span> delineated by the <span class="italic">frontal ethmoidal suture</span> (top of the <span class="italic">ethmoidal bone,</span> or <span class="italic">lamina papyracea</span>), marks the inferior boundary of the anterior cranial fossa. It is important to realize that surgical intervention above this anatomical landmark—as occurs, for example, during endoscopic sinus surgery—can result in entry into the anterior cranial fossa or a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The sphenoid sinus forms the medial wall of the optic canal (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-5</span>). Surgery within the sphenoid sinus has the potential to damage the optic nerve; alternatively, the sphenoid sinus is a surgical route facilitating decompression of the optic chiasm. In approximately 4% of patients, the bone may be incomplete, leaving only mucosa separating the sinus from the optic nerve. The <span class="italic">pterygomaxillary area,</span> which contains the sphenopalatine ganglion and the internal maxillary artery, underlies the apex of the orbit. This area communicates posteriorly through the <span class="italic">foramen rotundum</span> and the <span class="italic">vidian canal</span> to the <span class="italic">middle cranial fossa,</span> anteriorly through the <span class="italic">infraorbital canal</span> to the cheek and lower eyelid, and superiorly through the <span class="italic">inferior orbital fissure</span> to the orbit.</p>
			<p class="h3">Canals and fissures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The orbit communicates with the surrounding areas through several bony canals and fissures. Posteriorly, the orbit is contiguous with the <span class="italic">cavernous sinus</span> through the superior orbital fissure (see Fig&#160;1-2). The medial wall of the orbit continues as the lateral wall of the sphenoid bone, marking the medial extent of the cavernous sinus. Therefore, when sharp objects enter the medial orbit, they are directed through the superior orbital fissure, where they can lacerate the carotid artery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The orbit is connected superiorly and posteriorly to the anterior cranial fossa by way of the <span class="italic">optic canal</span> (see Fig&#160;1-2B), which transmits the optic nerve, ophthalmic artery, and some sympathetic fibers. Inferiorly at the apex, the orbit is connected to the <span class="italic">pterygopalatine area</span>—and thus the temporal and inferotemporal regions—through the inferior orbital fissure. This fissure, formed by the greater wing of the sphenoid, maxillary, zygomatic, and palatine bones, carries the maxillary branch of CN&#160;V (CN&#160;V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>), infraorbital vessels, the inferior ophthalmic vein, branches from the pterygopalatine ganglion, parasympathetic fibers that innervate the lacrimal gland, and collateral meningeal arteries that help connect the external and internal carotid circulation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anteriorly, the orbit connects to the <span class="italic">inferior meatus</span> of the nose (beneath the inferior turbinate) through the <span class="italic">nasolacrimal duct,</span> which carries tears into the nasal cavity. In addition, numerous variable bony canals carry blood vessels that travel to and from the orbit and surrounding structures. Some of the more constant of these canals include the <span class="italic">anterior</span> and <span class="italic">posterior ethmoidal foramina,</span> which carry blood vessels connecting the internal carotid circulation (ophthalmic artery) to the external carotid circulation (terminal branches of the ethmoidal arteries) at the level of the roof of the ethmoidal complex. Additional supraorbital and <span class="italic">zygomaticotemporal foramina</span> carry blood vessels between the orbit and corresponding vessels of the forehead and temple.</p>

			<div id="Chapt1_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Arterial System</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Knowledge of the vascular anatomy of the head is crucial to understanding the potential for ischemic damage to the visual system. Ischemia is among the most common pathophysiologic causes of visual dysfunction (including vision loss and double vision). The <span class="italic">common carotid arteries,</span> arising from the <span class="italic">innominate artery</span> on the right and directly from the aorta on the left, supply most of the blood to the skull and its contents. The remainder of the blood supply to the skull comes from the 2&#160;<span class="italic">vertebral arteries (VAs),</span> which enter the skull through the foramen magnum after traversing foramina in the cervical vertebral segments. Once the VAs penetrate the dura, they join near the pontomedullary junction to form the <span class="italic">basilar artery (BA),</span> which ascends along the anterior surface of the pons to terminate in the 2&#160;<span class="italic">posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs)</span> at the level of the midbrain.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The common carotid artery divides into internal and external branches at the angle of the jaw (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-6</span>). The <span class="italic">external carotid artery (ECA)</span> supplies blood to the face through its major branches of the <span class="italic">facial artery (FA).</span> The scalp is supplied via branches of the <span class="italic">occipital artery</span> posteriorly and the <span class="italic">superficial temporal artery</span> anteriorly. The paranasal sinuses receive their blood supply from branches of the <span class="italic">maxillary artery</span> (sphenopalatine and infraorbital), which terminates in the pterygopalatine fossa. The coverings of the brain are supplied by branches of the <span class="italic">middle meningeal artery (MMA)</span>—a major branch of the maxillary artery—which enters the middle cranial fossa through the foramen spinosum, lateral to the foramen ovale. Branches of the MMA supply the parasellar area, including the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus (containing CNs&#160;III, IV, and VI), and terminate in the arteries of the foramen rotundum and ovale. Variable meningeal branches may enter the superior orbital fissure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ophthalmologists are sometimes concerned about encountering branches of CN&#160;VII, particularly when performing a temporal artery biopsy or during orbital or lacrimal surgery. Terminal branches of the FA supply the marginal arcades of the eyelids. It is extremely important to understand the extent of the collateral connections between the branches of the ECA and the <span class="italic">internal carotid artery (ICA)</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-7</span>). This point is particularly germane to interventional neuroradiologists, who may inadvertently embolize distal ICA branches—including the <span class="italic">central retinal artery (CRA)</span>—while placing particles into the ECA. Embolization is most likely to occur during the treatment of arteriovenous malformations, but it can also occur when skull-base tumors are embolized prior to surgical resection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most important collateral connections between the internal and external circulations traverse the orbit. They include the <span class="italic">anterior</span> and <span class="italic">posterior ethmoidal arteries</span> in the medial orbit, the <span class="italic">infraorbital</span> and <span class="italic">supraorbital arteries</span> (including distal connections to the lacrimal artery) anteriorly, and the zygomaticotemporal branch laterally. The FA joins the distal branches of the <span class="italic">supratrochlear</span> and <span class="italic">infratrochlear arteries</span> around the <span class="italic">angular artery</span> in the medial orbit. In addition, variable collateral dural branches traverse the superior and inferior orbital fissures. In rare instances, the <span class="italic">ophthalmic artery</span> <span class="italic">(OphA)</span> may also arise as a branch of the meningeal system of the ECA.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ICA carries the major blood supply to the intracranial contents (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-8</span>). The ICA enters the skull through the carotid canal. Within the petrous bone, the ICA is near the middle and inner ear, as well as the intrapetrosal portion of CN&#160;VII. As the ICA reaches the parasellar area, it turns superiorly just above the foramen lacerum. It then enters the cavernous sinus, where it first gives off the <span class="italic">meningohypophyseal trunk</span> and then turns anteriorly to run horizontally parallel to the body of the sphenoid to give off the inferolateral trunk, which forms anastomoses with branches of the MMA. Branches of the meningohypophyseal trunk supply the dura at the back of the cavernous sinus as well as CNs&#160;III, IV, V, and VI entering the cavernous sinus. These branches also variably supply the lateral aspect of the sella turcica, including the pituitary capsule and a large portion of the pituitary gland itself.</p>
			<p class="body-text">At the anterior aspect of the cavernous sinus, the ICA makes a loop to reverse its direction under the anterior clinoid and the optic nerve. This loop passes through 2&#160;dural rings, both close to the anterior clinoid (the terminal portion of the lesser wing of the sphenoid). As the ICA passes through the second ring, it becomes intradural (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-9</span>). Just after it becomes intradural, the ICA gives off the OphA, which enters the orbit along with the optic nerve through the optic canal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Within the orbit, the OphA (see Fig&#160;1-7) may anastomose with recurrent meningeal branches that enter through the superior orbital fissure. The OphA gives off the CRA, which then enters the substance of the optic nerve approximately 10–12&#160;mm posterior to the globe. Within the eye, the CRA divides into superior and inferior arcades. Like the blood–brain barrier, the retinal arteries and arterioles have tight junctions that form a blood–retina barrier. The intraretinal arterioles run within the substance of the nerve fiber layer to supply the inner two-thirds of the retina.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">lacrimal artery (LA)</span> runs parallel to the lacrimal branch of CN V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> in the superior lateral orbital roof to reach the lacrimal gland. It also gives off the <span class="italic">anterior ciliary artery</span> of the lateral rectus muscle and reaches the anterior segment at the muscle’s insertion. The <span class="italic">frontal artery</span> runs within the superior orbit, paralleling the frontal branch of CN V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> to separate into and terminate as the supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries, which, along with the LA, supply the eyelid.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The next branches leaving the OphA are the <span class="italic">superior</span> and <span class="italic">inferior muscular arter</span><span class="italic">ies, </span>which supply the anterior ciliary arteries of the medial and inferior rectus (inferior muscular artery) and the superior rectus and superior oblique (superior muscular branch) muscles. The anterior ciliary arteries are responsible for the majority of blood flow to the ciliary body. The <span class="italic">medial</span> and <span class="italic">lateral long posterior ciliary arteries</span> variably anastomose with penetrating branches of the anterior ciliary arteries (within the rectus muscles) to form the <span class="italic">greater arterial circle</span> near the anterior part of the ciliary body. Branches from this circle extend radially within the iris to form a second anastomotic circle (the <span class="italic">lesser arterial </span><span class="italic">circle</span>) near the collarette of the iris.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The terminal OphA supplies additional branches that form collaterals with the <span class="italic">anterior</span> and <span class="italic">posterior ethmoidal arteries</span> and also form the <span class="italic">short</span> and <span class="italic">long posterior ciliary arteries </span>(<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-10</span>). The short posterior ciliary arteries divide into 10–20&#160;small branches that supply the optic nerve head (ONH) and posterior choroid. Together, these arteries supply blood to the choroid, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and approximately the outer one-third of the retina, including the photoreceptor cells. In approximately 30% of individuals, branches of the posterior ciliary arteries <span class="italic">(cilioretinal arteries)</span> directly supply a portion of the inner retina; this blood supply may protect the macula in the case of a CRA occlusion. Approximately 4&#160;short posterior ciliary arteries form a variably complete anastomotic ring (known as the <span class="italic">circle of Zinn-&#173;Haller</span>) around the ONH, which is also supplied from the peripapillary choroid and the terminal branches of the pial network.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Collateral branches from terminal branches of the infraorbital artery and the superficial temporal artery help supply the lower and upper eyelids and may also provide collateral supply to the anterior segment. These collaterals may be interrupted if the conjunctiva and Tenon capsule are removed from the limbus during ocular surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Distal to the origin of the OphA, the intradural supraclinoid ICA gives off the <span class="italic">anterior choroidal artery (AChoA)</span> and anastomoses with the proximal <span class="italic">posterior cerebral artery (PCA)</span> through the <span class="italic">posterior communicating artery (PCoA).</span> The AChoA supplies blood proximally to the optic tract and distally to the <span class="italic">lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-11</span>). Injury to the AChoA can produce the optic tract syndrome, a disorder consisting of contralateral homonymous hemianopia, contralateral band atrophy of the ONH, and a contralateral relative afferent pupillary defect (see Chapter&#160;4). The ICA gives&#160;off the <span class="italic">anterior </span><span class="italic">cerebral artery (ACA)</span> and terminates as branches of the <span class="italic">middle cerebral artery </span><span class="italic">(MCA).</span> The proximal ACA (the A1&#160;segment) crosses over the optic nerve and joins the opposite ACA via the <span class="italic">anterior communicating artery (ACoA).</span> The combination of the ACoA and PCoA makes up the <span class="italic">circle of Willis,</span> which permits collateral flow between the carotid and vertebrobasilar systems when there is vascular compromise. Small perforating branches arising from the proximal ACA as well as the ACoA supply the intracranial optic nerves and chiasm. Although the afferent visual pathways are spared with distal ACA occlusion, the premotor areas of the frontal lobes responsible for initiating saccades are supplied by branches of the ACA. Thus, patients with acute occlusion of the ACA may have a transient gaze preference and difficulty initiating saccades to the contralateral side, although this effect is more commonly seen in patients with MCA territory lesions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The MCA divides into several branches, which supply the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and superficial portions of the frontal lobe and occipital lobe. Branches important to the visual pathways include those supplying the optic radiations as they traverse the deep white matter of the parietal and temporal lobes. Terminal branches of the MCA also variably supply the occipital tip representing the macula. This supply is chiefly responsible for the perimetric finding of macular sparing in PCA or calcarine artery occlusion (see Chapter&#160;4, Fig&#160;4-32). In addition to supplying the afferent pathways, the MCA supplies the middle temporal region, which is involved in visually guided pursuit movements. Thus, lack of blood supply can cause problems with ipsilateral pursuit or asymmetry in optokinetic nystagmus when a clinician rotates the OKN drum toward the side of the infarct.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Blood supply to the posterior aspect of the intracranial contents begins with the aortic arch. The right VA arises from the innominate artery, and the left VA begins as a branch off the proximal <span class="italic">subclavian artery.</span> The VA travels through a series of foramina in the lateral aspects of the cervical vertebral processes. After penetrating the dura at the foramen magnum, the VA gives rise to the <span class="italic">posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)</span> before joining the other VA to form the BA (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-12</span>). The PICA represents the most caudal of the 2&#160;major circumferential arteries that wrap around the brainstem. Proximally, the PICA and BA first give off branches that perforate the medial portion of the brainstem at the medullary level; the paramedian branches that follow supply the lateral aspects of the brainstem. Distally, the PICA supplies the inferior cerebellum, which is intimately involved in eye movements. VA or PICA occlusion is associated with the lateral medullary syndrome (also called Wallenberg syndrome) (see Chapter&#160;2, Fig&#160;2-6). The second circumferential arteries are branches of the <span class="italic">anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA).</span> The AICA arises from the caudal BA and supplies the pontomedullary junction and distal cerebellum. A large proximal branch of the AICA, the <span class="italic">internal auditory artery,</span> supplies the CN&#160;VIII complex in the subarachnoid space and follows it into the internal auditory canal. Along the course of the BA, small perforators arise directly to supply portions of the pons and midbrain. The median perforators of the BA supply the medial longitudinal fasciculus, the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF), and the medially located nuclei of CNs&#160;III, IV, and VI. Interruption of these branches (which occurs commonly with vertebrobasilar atherosclerotic disease or emboli to these end arteries) often produces variable ophthalmoplegia, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and skew deviation. Pontine branches of the BA also supply the proximal portions of the CNs (particularly CN&#160;V) as they exit the brainstem.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The distal 2&#160;sets of circumferential arteries consist of the <span class="italic">superior cerebellar artery (SCA)</span> followed by the PCA, representing the terminal branches of the BA at the level of the midbrain. Perforators from the proximal SCA partially supply the nucleus of CN&#160;III and its fascicles. In addition, small branches often supply the CN&#160;V root. CN&#160;III exits between the SCA and the PCA, where it may be compressed by an aneurysm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Perforators from the proximal PCA (the P1 segment) supply the rostral portion of the midbrain (the portion involved in vertical gaze) and part of the LGN. A large branch, the <span class="italic">artery of Percheron,</span> often supplies both sides of the midbrain from one of the PCAs. Because <span class="italic">thalamostriate arteries</span> originate from P1, infarcts related to the internal ICA–MCA spare the thalamus. The P1 segment ends with the PCoA, which joins the vertebrobasilar circulation to the carotid circulation anteriorly. The connecting PCoA parallels the course of CN&#160;III and then joins the ICA, which explains the occurrence of CN&#160;III palsy with PCoA aneurysms (see Chapters&#160;2 and 7). As the distal PCA courses around the brainstem, it gives off a <span class="italic">parieto-&#173;occipital branch</span> before terminating in the <span class="italic">calcarine branch,</span> which supplies the primary visual cortex (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-13</span>).</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular venous outflow begins in the <span class="italic">arcade retinal veins,</span> which exit into the <span class="italic">central retinal vein (CRV),</span> and in the <span class="italic">choroidal veins,</span> which exit the sclera through the <span class="italic">vortex veins.</span> Anteriorly, the episcleral venous plexus collects both blood from the anterior uveal circulation and aqueous percolating through the Schlemm canal. These 3&#160;primary venous drainage pathways (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-14</span>) empty mainly into the <span class="italic">superior ophthalmic vein,</span> which runs posteriorly within the superior medial orbit to the orbital apex, where it crosses laterally to enter the cavernous sinus posterior to the superior orbital fissure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Microscopic collaterals variably exist between these venous beds. In rare instances, shunts connecting retinal veins to choroidal veins are present within the retina. More commonly (usually in association with central retinal vein occlusion or optic nerve sheath meningioma), optociliary shunt vessels (retinochoroidal collateral vessels) may appear on the ONH surface. At a more macroscopic level, the superior ophthalmic vein is variably connected anteriorly to the <span class="italic">angular</span> and <span class="italic">facial veins</span> and inferiorly to the <span class="italic">inferior ophthalmic vein</span> and <span class="italic">pterygoid plexus.</span> These collaterals may become important, particularly in patients with elevated venous pressure (usually related to a carotid cavernous fistula).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intracranially, the superficial cortical venous system drains mainly superiorly and medially to the <span class="italic">superior sagittal sinus</span> running in the sagittal midline (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-15</span>). In addition to the cortical drainage, the superior sagittal sinus absorbs CSF through the arachnoid villi and the pacchionian granulations. Thus, obstruction to venous outflow results in decreased CSF absorption and elevated intracranial pressure. The superior sagittal sinus runs posteriorly to terminate at the <span class="italic">torcular Herophili</span> (confluence of the venous sinuses) at the level of the tentorium that separates the cerebellum from the occipital lobes. The <span class="italic">transverse sinuses</span> run anteriorly from the connection of the tentorium and the skull to the petrous pyramid, where they turn to run caudally as the <span class="italic">sigmoid sinus</span> down to the <span class="italic">jugular bulb,</span> where the <span class="italic">internal jugular vein</span> exits the skull.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Inferior superficial cortical venous drainage is carried directly down to the transverse and sigmoid sinuses through the <span class="italic">vein of Labbé</span> and the <span class="italic">basilar vein of Rosenthal.</span> The deep drainage of the supratentorial diencephalon and mesencephalon begins with the deep-&#173;draining veins (often in relationship to the ventricular system). These deep veins drain together to form the <span class="italic">vein of Galen,</span> which runs posteriorly to drain into the straight sinus. The vein of Galen runs within the tentorium to drain, along with the superior sagittal sinus, into the torcular Herophili.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some anterior cerebral venous drainage may access the cavernous sinus. The 2&#160;cavernous sinuses are joined by variable connections through the sella and posteriorly through a plexus of veins over the clivus. The cavernous sinus drains primarily caudally into the jugular bulb via the <span class="italic">inferior petrosal sinus,</span> which traverses the Dorello canal with CN&#160;VI under the petroclinoid ligament. Alternatively, drainage may occur laterally along the petrous apex through the <span class="italic">superior petrosal sinus</span> to the junction of the transverse and sigmoid sinuses (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-16</span>). Small veins may drain through the foramen rotundum and foramen ovale as well as through the pterygoid plexus to anastomose with the <span class="italic">facial venous system (external jugular vein).</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Veins of the eyelids anastomose medially between the <span class="italic">angular vein</span> and branches of the superior ophthalmic vein (particularly at the superior medial orbit in the region of the trochlea). Facial veins drain inferiorly and laterally to form the external jugular vein, which eventually joins the internal jugular in the neck.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Afferent Visual Pathways</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Any disturbance in afferent function may result in the same symptoms of vision loss as observed with pathology affecting the retina, optic nerve, and visual pathways (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-17</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Retina</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The afferent visual pathway begins within the retina. Details of retinal anatomy can be found in BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span> The following discussion focuses on key points relevant to neuro-&#173;ophthalmology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The absence of retinal receptors over the ONH creates a <span class="italic">physiologic scotoma</span> <span class="italic">(</span><span class="italic">blind spot),</span> located approximately 17° from the fovea and measuring approximately 5° by 7°. The fovea (approximately 1.5&#160;mm, or 1&#160;disc diameter) is located approximately 4&#160;mm (or 2.5&#160;disc diameters) from and 0.8&#160;mm lower than the ONH.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The RPE is in direct contact with the retinal photoreceptor cells. Between the outer and inner retinal layers, the retinal signal generated in rods and cones is processed primarily through the bipolar cells that synapse on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). A subset of melanopsin-&#173;containing RGCs, known as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), serve primarily nonvisual light-&#173;dependent functions such as the pupillary light reflex.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Horizontal, amacrine,</span> and <span class="italic">interplexiform cells</span> (which communicate horizontally between neighboring cells) permit signal processing within the retinal layers. The glial support cells—<span class="italic">Müller cells</span> and <span class="italic">astrocytes</span>—play an important metabolic role.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ratio of photoreceptor cells to RGCs varies depending on the region of the retina. The ratio is highest in the periphery (at more than 1000:1) and lowest at the fovea (where an RGC may receive a signal from 1&#160;single cone). Because of the increased central density of RGCs (69% within the central 30°), the foveal bipolar cells and RGCs are displaced radially from the fovea, with the bipolar cells receiving input via long cone axons that make up the <span class="italic">Henle layer.</span> The radial nature of the Henle layer is responsible for the accumulation of fluid in the macula in a star-shaped pattern.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another notable anatomical feature of the retina is the location of the ONH and the beginning of the optic nerve nasal to the fovea. Thus, although ganglion cell fibers coming from the nasal retina can travel uninterrupted directly to the ONH, those coming from the temporal retina must avoid the macula by anatomically separating to enter the ONH at either the superior or the inferior pole (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-18</span>). This unique anatomy means that some of the nasal fibers (nasal within the macula) enter the ONH on its temporal side <span class="italic">(papillomacular bundle).</span> Focal loss of the nerve fiber layer may appear as either grooves or slits or as reflections that parallel the retinal arterioles where the internal limiting membrane drapes over the vessels. Diffuse loss of the nerve fiber layer is often more difficult to detect and brings the retinal vessels into sharp relief.</p>
			<p class="h2">Optic Nerve</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The optic nerve begins anatomically at the ONH but physiologically and functionally within the RGC layer that covers the entire retina. The first portion of the optic nerve, representing the confluence of approximately 1.0–1.2&#160;million RGC axons, traverses the sclera through the lamina cribrosa, which contains approximately 200–300&#160;channels. The combination of small channels and a unique blood supply (largely from branches of the posterior ciliary arteries) probably plays a role in several optic neuropathies. Axonal transport—both anterograde and retrograde—of molecules, subcellular organelles, and metabolic products occurs along the length of the optic nerve and is an energy-&#173;dependent system requiring high concentrations of oxygen. The anterograde axonal transport system can be subdivided into slow, intermediate, and fast speeds. The axonal transport system is sensitive to ischemic, inflammatory, and compressive processes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Just posterior to the sclera, the optic nerve acquires a dural sheath that is contiguous with the periorbita of the optic canal and an arachnoid membrane that supports and protects the axons and is contiguous with the arachnoid of the subdural intracranial space through the optic canal. This arrangement permits free circulation of CSF around the optic nerve up to the ONH. Just posterior to the lamina cribrosa, the optic nerve also acquires a myelin coating, which increases its diameter to approximately 3&#160;mm (6&#160;mm including the optic nerve sheath) from the 1.5&#160;mm of the ONH. The myelin investment is part of the membrane of oligodendrocytes that join the nerve posterior to the sclera.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The intraorbital optic nerve extends approximately 30&#160;mm to the optic canal. The extra length of the intraorbital optic nerve allows unimpeded globe rotation as well as axial shifts within the orbit. The CRA and CRV travel within the anterior 10–12&#160;mm of the optic nerve. The CRA supplies only a minor portion of the optic nerve circulation; most of the blood supply comes from pial branches of the surrounding meninges, which are in turn supplied by small branches of the OphA (see Fig&#160;1-10). An approximate topographic representation is maintained in the optic nerve. Peripheral retinal receptors are found more peripherally, and the papillomacular bundle travels temporally and increasingly centrally within the nerve.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As the optic nerve enters the optic canal, its dural sheath fuses with the periorbita. It is also surrounded by the <span class="italic">annulus of Zinn,</span> which serves as the origin of the 4&#160;rectus muscles and the superior oblique muscle. Within the canal, the optic nerve is accompanied by the OphA inferiorly and separated from the superior orbital fissure by the optic strut (the lateral aspect of the lesser wing of the sphenoid), which terminates superiorly as the anterior clinoid. Medially, the optic nerve is separated from the sphenoid sinus by bone that may be thin or dehiscent. The optic canal normally measures approximately 8–10&#160;mm long and 5–7&#160;mm wide but may be elongated and narrowed by processes that cause bone thickening (eg, fibrous dysplasia, intraosseous meningioma). The canal runs superiorly and medially. Within the canal, the optic nerve is relatively anchored and can easily be injured by shearing forces transmitted from blunt facial trauma (see Chapter&#160;4).</p>
			<p class="body-text">At its intracranial passage, the optic nerve passes under a fold of dura (the falciform ligament) that may impinge on the nerve, especially if it is elevated by lesions arising from the bone of the sphenoid (tuberculum) or the sella. Once it becomes intracranial, the optic nerve no longer has a sheath. The anterior loop of the carotid artery usually lies just below and temporal to the nerve, and the proximal ACA passes over the nerve. The gyrus rectus, the most inferior portion of the frontal lobe, lies above and parallel to the optic nerves. The 8–12&#160;mm intracranial portion of the optic nerve continues to the optic chiasm.</p>
			<p class="h2">Optic Chiasm</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The optic chiasm measures approximately 12&#160;mm wide, 8&#160;mm long in the anteroposterior direction, and 4&#160;mm thick (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-19</span>). It is inclined at almost 45° and is supplied by small arterial branches from the proximal ACA and ACoA. The chiasm is located just anterior to the hypothalamus and the anterior third ventricle (forming part of its anterior wall and causing an invagination) and approximately 10&#160;mm above the sella. The exact location of the chiasm with respect to the sella varies but is usually directly superior (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-20</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Within the chiasm, the fibers coming from the nasal retina (approximately 53% of total fibers) cross to the opposite side to join the corresponding contralateral fibers. The inferior fibers (those subserving the superior visual field) are the first to cross. The anterior loop of fibers into the contralateral optic nerve (Wilbrand knee) may be an artifact in monkeys, but not necessarily in humans. The finding of a superior temporal visual field defect contralateral to a central scotoma localizes the pathology to the junction of the optic nerve and chiasm. The macular fibers tend to cross posteriorly within the chiasm; this arrangement underlies the bitemporal scotomatous field defects observed with posterior chiasmatic compression.</p>
			<p class="h2">Optic Tract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The fibers exiting from the chiasm proceed circumferentially around the diencephalon lateral to the hypothalamus and in contact with the ambient cistern (see Fig&#160;1-11). Just prior to the LGN, the fibers involved in the pupillary pathways exit to the pretectal nuclei; other fibers exit to the superficial layers of the superior colliculi (SC) via the brachium of the SC. These fibers, which originate from ipRGCs, are likely the sole source of pupillomotor input from the retina to the midbrain. The ipRGCs also project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which is probably responsible for light-&#173;induced diurnal rhythms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The incongruous nature of optic tract visual field defects is explained by the lack of proximity between corresponding fibers from the right and left eyes. Most of the axons that originate in the retinal ganglion cells terminate within the LGN.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The LGN is located in the posterior thalamus below and lateral to the pulvinar and above the lateral recess of the ambient cistern. The LGN is a peaked, mushroom-&#173;shaped structure that is divided into 6&#160;levels. The 4&#160;superior levels are the termini of P-cell axons, which are the ganglion cells with smaller receptive fields; they are responsible for mediating maximal spatial resolution and color perception. The 2&#160;inferior layers receive input from M-cell fibers, which are the ganglion cells with larger receptive fields; they are more sensitive to motion detection. Axons originating in the contralateral eye terminate in layers&#160;1, 4, and 6 of the LGN; the ipsilateral fibers innervate layers&#160;2, 3, and 5. As the fibers approach the LGN, the superior fibers move superomedially and the inferior fibers swing inferolaterally. Overall, the retinal representation rotates almost 90°, with the superior fibers moving medially and the inferior fibers laterally. The macular fibers tend to move superolaterally. Cortical and subcortical pathways may modulate activity in the LGN. In addition, the cortex, SC, and pretectal nuclei project back to the LGN.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cortex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Following a synapse in the LGN, the axons travel posteriorly as the optic radiations to terminate in the primary visual (calcarine) cortex in the occipital lobe (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-21</span>). The most inferior of the fibers first travel anteriorly, then laterally and posteriorly to loop around the temporal horn of the lateral ventricles (called the Meyer loop) (see Fig&#160;1-17). More superiorly, the fibers travel posteriorly through the deep white matter of the parietal lobe. The macular (central) fibers course laterally, with the peripheral fibers concentrated more at the superior and inferior aspects of the radiations. Injury to fibers within a radiation produces a homonymous hemianopia, a contralateral visual field defect that respects the vertical midline. If the corresponding fibers from the 2&#160;eyes are close to each other, the field defect is identical in each eye, or congruous. Congruous field defects occur as a result of lesions involving the calcarine cortex. More anterior involvement often produces incongruous field defects, suggesting that the corresponding fibers lie farther apart more anteriorly in the visual pathways.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">primary visual cortex</span> (known variously as <span class="italic">V1, striate cortex,</span> or <span class="italic">Brodmann area&#160;17</span>) is arrayed along the horizontal calcarine fissure, which divides the medial surface of the occipital lobe. Fibers of the optic radiations terminate in the fourth layer of the 6&#160;layers of the primary visual cortex. The macular fibers terminate more posteriorly. Fibers from the most lateral (temporal crescent) visual field (originating only in the contralateral eye) terminate most anteriorly.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cortex is heavily weighted to central retinal activity, with 50%–60% of the cortex responding to activity within the central 10° and approximately 80% of the cortex devoted to macular activity (within 30°). The superior portion of the cortex continues to receive information from the inferior visual field in a retinotopic distribution. This retinotopic mapping throughout the afferent visual pathways allows lesions to be localized based on visual field defects. In addition, the anteromedial portion of the striate cortex represents the far monocular temporal visual field of the contralateral eye (temporal crescent). Therefore, a far monocular temporal visual field defect localizes the lesion to the contralateral anterior occipital cortex (see Fig&#160;1-21).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">parastriate cortex</span> (also called <span class="italic">V2,</span> or <span class="italic">Brodmann area&#160;18</span>) is contiguous with the primary visual cortex and receives its input from V1. Area&#160;V3 lies primarily in the posterior parietal lobe and also receives direct input from V1. Area&#160;V3 has no sharp histologic delineation from V2 and sends efferent information to the basal ganglia (pulvinar) and the midbrain. Cells in this area are thought to be able to respond to more than one stimulus dimension, suggesting that visual integration occurs in this region. Area&#160;V4, which is located within the lingual and fusiform gyrus, seems to be particularly sensitive to color. Damage to this area is probably responsible for most cases of cerebral achromatopsia. Anterior and lateral to area&#160;V4, V5 (posterior and within the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus subangularis) is very sensitive to movement and direction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-22</span>). The underlying white matter is heavily myelinated. Area&#160;V5, which corresponds to the medial temporal visual region, receives ipsilateral input from V1 and direct input from the M-cell layers of the LGN. The neurons in this area encode the speed and direction of moving stimuli. This sensory area is likely the origin of pursuit movements and thus connects the afferent and efferent pathways. The receptive fields of V5 are larger than those of V1. The SC receives afferent input both directly from the anterior visual pathways and indirectly from the calcarine cortex. The superficial layers contain a retinotopic map that overlies the deeper layers, which are primarily concerned with saccadic generation.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The anatomical, physiologic, and pathologic understanding of the ocular motor system has increased dramatically over the past decades due to results derived from primate model experiments, human electrophysiology testing, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, and the clinical-pathologic-&#173;radiologic correlations of disorders in patients with documented eye movement abnormalities.</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Cortical Input</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The efferent visual system spans a large segment of the central nervous system; many areas of the brain generate eye movements (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-23</span>). Saccadic and smooth-&#173;pursuit eye movements were once thought to be derived from distinct supranuclear pathways; however, it now appears that these systems overlap considerably. In addition, there are 2&#160;major visual pathways: one for the movement of images (magnocellular: M&#160;cells) and the other for discrimination of images (parvocellular: P&#160;cells).</p>
			<p class="h3">Saccadic system</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cortical, or supranuclear, input for generating saccadic eye movements is divided into 2&#160;parallel and interconnected descending pathways: (1)&#160;visually reflexive (parietal lobe) movements and (2)&#160;memory-&#173;guided and volitional (frontal lobe) movements. Visually guided movements require afferent system information either from the primary visual system and cortex or from the accessory afferent system. The visually guided (to seen or remembered targets) and volitional saccadic supranuclear input comes largely from the FEFs, or <span class="italic">Brodmann area&#160;8.</span> Cortical cells discharge prior to all voluntary and visually guided contralateral saccades. SEFs—located on the dorsomedial surface of the superior frontal gyrus—receive input from the FEFs and are responsible for programming saccades, particularly as part of learned behavior. In general, these cortical fibers project to the following structures in an organized framework:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">subcortical structures:</span> BG, thalamus, and SC</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">brainstem neural network or premotor neurons:</span> several types of pontine neurons</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">brainstem saccade generators:</span> PPRF and rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">motoneurons of the ocular motor CNs</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Few cortical fibers project directly to the PPRF and riMLF. Cortical projections to the SC also arise from the PPC for visually guided reflexive saccades.</p>
			<p class="h3">Smooth-pursuit system</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The smooth-&#173;pursuit system for visual targets originates in area&#160;V5—the human homologue of the <span class="italic">medial temporal (MT)</span> visual area in the rhesus monkey—where it receives input from the primary visual system, both from the cortex (striate and extrastriate areas) and likely from magnocellular input directly from the LGN (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-24</span>). The <span class="italic">medial superior temporal (MST)</span> area is also involved in generating pursuit signals in response to moving stimuli. The area appears to be supplied with information about head movement as well as eye movement commands (efference copy) and thus generates pursuit movements to follow a target while the head is moving. Target recognition and selection probably receive additional input through the reciprocal connections to the PPC. Information from the MT and MST projects via the posterior portion of the internal capsule to the <span class="italic">dorsolateral pontine nuclei (DLPN)</span> and lateral pontine nuclei. From these pontine nuclei, projections are sent to the cerebellum (paraflocculus and dorsal vermis), with outflow signals to the vestibular nuclei. The smooth-&#173;pursuit system is a double decussating pathway (the decussation occurs in both the pons and cerebellum); therefore, it can be simplistically considered an ipsilateral system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For information on clinical disorders of the pursuit function, see Chapter&#160;8 in this volume.</p>
			<p class="h2">Subcortical Structures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The SC is divided into 2&#160;parts: (1)&#160;superficial (dorsal) and (2)&#160;deep (ventral). The sensory signal (input from the visual cortex and retina) is processed mainly by the superficial SC. The motor signal originates within the deeper layers (the stratum griseum profundum and stratum album profundum) that receive position information from the more superficial layers. The SC projects contralaterally to multiple locations throughout the brainstem, including the DLPN.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Both the parietal and frontal lobe supranuclear pathways travel mainly to the SC; few fibers connect directly to brainstem premotor neurons. The supranuclear pathways also go through the BG (caudate nucleus, putamen nucleus, and substantia nigra pars reticulate). The BG appears to have several roles in the saccadic system, including inhibiting unnecessary reflexive saccades during fixation and helping control voluntary saccades.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The thalamus (internal medullary lamina and pulvinar) is involved in programming saccades. It receives information from the cortex and brainstem and projects only to the cortex and BG. Therefore, the thalamus appears to relay messages from the brainstem to the cortical eye fields.</p>
			<p class="h2">Brainstem</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The supranuclear pathways for saccades and smooth pursuit eventually reach the brainstem neural network (via the SC and BG), which allows for conjugate eye movements. The following list of major anatomical structures and their functions helps set a foundation for discussion of the pathways for coordinating conjugate eye movements (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-25</span>):</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In general, the midbrain is responsible for vertical eye movements and the pons for horizontal eye movements. Vertical and torsional saccades are generated from excitatory burst cells of the riMLF within the midbrain. In contrast, the pathways for vertical vestibular and vertical smooth pursuit ascend from the medulla and pons to the midbrain via the MLF. Horizontal saccades are generated from excitatory burst cells within the PPRF, and horizontal smooth-&#173;pursuit eye movements arise from the CN&#160;VI nucleus, which receives input from the vestibulocerebellum (see the section “Cerebellum,” later in this chapter).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vertical gaze is controlled through the midbrain. The primary gaze center is located in the riMLF (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-26</span>). This area receives input from the medial and superior vestibular nuclei via the MLF and other internuclear connections. Other areas in the rostral midbrain, including the INC, also modulate vertical motility. Burst-cell input may come in part from the PPRF caudally but also locally from within the riMLF. The INC (the neural integrator for vertical and torsional gaze) receives signals from the riMLF and from the vestibular nuclei and projects via the PC to the motoneurons of the CN&#160;III and CN&#160;IV nuclei. Activity from the vertical gaze center is distributed to the CN&#160;III and CN&#160;IV nuclei. Information involved in upgaze crosses in the PC. Damage to this pathway results in dorsal midbrain syndrome, a disorder that includes vertical gaze difficulty (most commonly, impaired supraduction), skew deviation, light–near pupillary dissociation, eyelid retraction, and convergence-&#173;retraction nystagmus (see Chapter&#160;9 in this volume).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Horizontal gaze is coordinated through the CN&#160;VI nucleus in the dorsal caudal pons (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-27</span>). This nucleus receives tonic input from the contralateral horizontal semicircular canal through the medial and lateral vestibular nuclei. Burst information is supplied from the PPRF, which is directly adjacent to the CN&#160;VI nucleus and the MLF. The burst cells are normally inhibited by omnipause neurons. Saccades are thought to be initiated by supranuclear inhibition of the omnipause cells, which allows burst-cell impulses to activate the horizontal and vertical gaze centers. To produce horizontal movement of both eyes, a signal to increase firing must be distributed to the ipsilateral lateral rectus and the contralateral medial rectus muscles. The lateral rectus muscle is supplied directly through ipsilateral CN&#160;VI. The contralateral medial rectus muscle is stimulated by interneurons that cross in the pons and ascend in the contralateral MLF. Therefore, pathology affecting the right MLF will result in a right <span class="italic">internuclear ophthalmoplegia</span>—a right (ipsilateral) adduction deficit with attempted left gaze—often accompanied by abducting nystagmus of the left (contralateral) eye and a skew deviation (see Chapter&#160;7, Fig&#160;7-5).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The distribution of infranuclear (ocular motor cranial nuclei and nerves) as well as supranuclear information requires internuclear communication within the brainstem. The most important of these pathways, the MLF, runs in 2&#160;parallel columns from the spinal cord to an area of the midbrain PC that is located dorsomedial to the red nucleus and rostral to the INC. The bulk of the fibers contributing to the MLF originate in the vestibular nuclei. The projections from the superior vestibular nucleus are ipsilateral, and those from the medial vestibular nucleus are contralateral. The MLF also receives interneurons originating from the contralateral CN&#160;VI nucleus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To maintain eccentric gaze, additional tonic input must be provided to the yoke muscles that hold the eye in position. This additional input is provided by integrating the velocity signal provided by the burst-&#173;neuron activity. For horizontal eye movements, integration takes place in the NPH, located adjacent to the medial vestibular nucleus at the pontomedullary junction, with input from the cerebellum. Neural integration for vertical eye movements involves the INC in addition to the cerebellum. Pathology affecting the neural integrator (often metabolic, associated with alcohol consumption or anticonvulsant medication) results in failure to maintain eccentric gaze, recognized clinically as gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus (see Chapter&#160;9).</p>
			<p class="h3">Vestibular-ocular system</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The output of the vestibular nuclei provides both the major supranuclear input into ocular motility and the major tonic input into eye position. This system has one of the shortest arcs in the nervous system, producing a fast response with extremely short latency. The hair cells of the semicircular canals alter their firing in response to relative movement of the endolymph (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-28</span>). The signal is produced by a change in velocity (head acceleration) in any 1 of 3&#160;axes. The information is then conveyed to the vestibular nuclei (located laterally in the rostral medulla) via the inferior and superior vestibular nerves. Hair cells in the macula acoustica of the utricle and saccule also contribute to the vestibular nerve. Calcium carbonate crystals within the otoliths respond to linear acceleration (most importantly, gravity) to orient the body. The vestibular nerve and the output of <br />the membranous labyrinth (the cochlear nerve) make up the CN&#160;VIII complex and exit the petrous bone through the internal auditory meatus. CN&#160;VIII traverses the subarachnoid space within the cerebellopontine angle. Within the medulla, the vestibular information synapses in the medial, lateral, and superior vestibular nuclei. Tonic information from the horizontal canal crosses directly to the contralateral gaze center within the CN&#160;VI nucleus in the dorsal medial aspect of the caudal pons just under the fourth ventricle. Tonic information from the anterior and posterior canals travels rostrally through several of the important internuclear connections to innervate the vertical gaze center in the rostral midbrain. Medial and inferior vestibular nuclei, as well as the NPH and the inferior olivary nucleus, project to the <span class="italic">nodulus</span> (a central nucleus of the cerebellum) and the <span class="italic">ventral uvula.</span> This pathway, which projects back to the vestibular nuclei, is responsible for the velocity storage mechanism (ie, the mechanism that maintains the vestibular signal beyond the output of the primary vestibular neurons).</p>
			<p class="body-text">For information on clinical disorders of vestibular-&#173;ocular function, see Chapter&#160;8.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Cerebellum</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The other major connection in the ocular motor system is to the <span class="italic">vestibulocerebellum.</span> The structures in this area, largely through the brachium conjunctivum, are responsible for adjusting the gain of all ocular movements. <span class="italic">Gain</span> may be defined as the output divided by the input. For example, keeping the eyes stable in space while the head rotates requires the eyes to move in a direction opposite that of head rotation at the same velocity and distance; this would be considered a gain of 1. The cerebellum is involved in gain adjustment to allow compensation after peripheral lesions (eg, vestibular nerve dysfunction such as vestibular neuritis). Disease processes directly affecting the cerebellum may affect the vestibular-&#173;ocular reflex.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Efference copy</span> information (regarding the position of the eyes) is supplied directly from the ocular motor pathways (possibly through cell groups of the paramedian tracts within the vestibular nuclei), whereas <span class="italic">afferent signal error</span> information arrives at the cerebellum via the climbing fibers from the inferior olivary nucleus. Additional cerebellar inputs include <span class="italic">mossy fiber input</span> from the vestibular nuclei and the NPH. Purkinje cells within the paraflocculus discharge during smooth pursuit. The dorsal vermis may play a role in initiating pursuit and saccades. The fastigial nucleus is responsible for overcoming a natural imbalance in the input from the vertically oriented semicircular canals. Thus, loss of fastigial function may be associated with development of downbeat nystagmus, as the imbalance in the vertical information causes constant updrift.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See Chapter&#160;9 in this volume for further discussion of nystagmus and other spontaneous eye movement disorders.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Ocular Motor Cranial Nerves</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Without neural activity, the visual axes are usually mildly to moderately divergent. The major tonic input to ocular motility is supplied by 3&#160;pairs of ocular motor CNs—CNs&#160;III, IV, and VI—that innervate the 6&#160;EOMs controlling ocular movement (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-29</span>). In addition, CN&#160;III innervates the levator palpebrae superioris and the pupillary sphincter muscles.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Except for the inferior oblique muscle, the innervation to each of the EOMs occurs at approximately one-third of the distance from the apex. The inferior oblique muscle receives its innervation at approximately its midpoint from a neurovascular bundle running parallel to the lateral aspect of the inferior rectus muscle. All 6&#160;EOMs receive their innervation on the inside surface, except for the superior oblique, where branches of CN&#160;IV terminate on the upper (outer) surface of the muscle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See Chapter&#160;7 for information on the clinical presentation of disorders due to infranuclear, fascicular, and peripheral ocular motor CN&#160;lesions.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Abducens nerve (sixth cranial nerve)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">CN&#160;VI originates in the dorsal caudal pons just beneath the fourth ventricle. Its nucleus is surrounded by the looping fibers (genu) of CN&#160;VII and is adjacent to the PPRF and the MLF (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-30</span>). The CN&#160;VI nucleus contains primary motoneurons and interneurons that cross to the contralateral MLF to reach the CN&#160;III nucleus. Thus, pathology affecting the CN&#160;VI nucleus produces an ipsilateral gaze palsy. The motor axons exiting the CN&#160;VI nucleus (approximately 4000–6000&#160;axons) travel ventrally and slightly laterally, medial to the superior olivary nucleus, to exit on the ventral surface of the caudal pons. As the fascicles pass through the brainstem, they lie adjacent to the spinal tract of CN&#160;V and traverse the corticobulbar tracts. Exiting the brainstem, the nerve runs rostrally within the subarachnoid space on the surface of the clivus from the area of the cerebellopontine angle to the posterior superior portion of the posterior fossa. The nerve pierces the dura approximately 1&#160;cm below the petrous apex and travels beneath the petroclinoid ligament (Gruber ligament, which connects the petrous pyramid to the posterior clinoid) to enter the canal of Dorello. Within the canal, CN&#160;VI travels with the inferior petrosal sinus. Once it becomes extradural, the nerve is within the cavernous sinus (the only CN&#160;within the substance of the cavernous sinus), where it runs parallel to the horizontal segment of the carotid artery and CN&#160;V<span class="subscript CharOverride-2">1</span>. It is also joined for a short segment by branches of the sympathetic chain lying within the wall of the intrapetrous carotid artery. Reaching the anterior portion of the cavernous sinus, CN&#160;VI traverses the superior orbital fissure (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-31</span>) through the annulus of Zinn (see Fig&#160;1-2C) to enter the medial surface of the lateral rectus muscle.</p>
			<p class="h3">Trochlear nerve (fourth cranial nerve)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The CN&#160;IV nucleus lies within the gray matter in the dorsal aspect of the caudal midbrain just below the aqueduct, directly contiguous with the more rostral CN&#160;III nucleus (see Fig&#160;1-30). The intra-&#173;axial portion (fascicle) of CN&#160;IV is very short, running dorsally around the periaqueductal gray to cross within the anterior medullary vellum just caudal to the inferior colliculi and below the pineal gland. CN&#160;IV is the only CN&#160;that exits on the dorsal surface of the brainstem and has the longest unprotected intracranial course (which is probably responsible for its frequent involvement in closed-head trauma). Within the subarachnoid space, CN&#160;IV (which contains approximately 2000&#160;fibers) swings around the midbrain, paralleling the tentorium just under the tentorial edge (where it is easily damaged during neurosurgical procedures that involve the tentorium).</p>
			<p class="body-text">CN&#160;IV enters the posterior lateral aspect of the cavernous sinus below the anterior tentorial insertion and underneath CN&#160;III. Covered by a variable sheath, CN&#160;IV runs forward within the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. Anteriorly, CN&#160;IV crosses over CN&#160;III to enter the superior orbital fissure outside and superior to the annulus of Zinn. CN&#160;IV crosses over the optic nerve to enter the superior oblique muscle within the superior medial orbit.</p>
			<p class="h3">Oculomotor nerve (third cranial nerve)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The CN&#160;III nucleus is located dorsally within the midbrain beneath the aqueduct connecting the third and fourth ventricles (see Fig&#160;1-31). The nuclear complex itself represents a collection of subnuclei that have specific identifiable functions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-32</span>). The fibers destined to innervate the levator palpebrae superioris, medial rectus, inferior rectus, pupil sphincter, and ciliary body muscles exit ventrally ipsilateral to the individual nuclei from which they originate. In contrast, the fibers from the superior rectus subnucleus, which lies along the midline, cross before exiting the brainstem to innervate the superior rectus muscle. Within the midbrain, CN&#160;III is topographically organized into a superior division (supplying the superior rectus and levator palpebrae superioris muscles) and an inferior division (supplying the medial and inferior rectus, inferior oblique, pupillary sphincter, and ciliary body muscles), but the true anatomical division into 2&#160;branches occurs at the level of the anterior cavernous sinus/superior orbital fissure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The fascicles of CN&#160;III traverse the ventral midbrain tegmentum, passing near and possibly through the red nucleus, the substantia nigra, and the corticospinal tracts within the cerebral peduncle. Numerous fascicles, totaling approximately 15,000&#160;fibers, exit on the ventral surface of the peduncles. Although considered to be a single structure within the subarachnoid space, as is the case in the midbrain, the nerve and its various fibers are topographically organized. Within the subarachnoid space, the nerve passes between the SCA below and the PCA above. The nerve runs slightly oblique to the tentorial edge, parallel and lateral to the PCoA. The pupillary fibers are usually found on the dorsomedial surface of the nerve, where they are anatomically vulnerable to compression. The <span class="italic">uncus,</span> which is the most medial aspect of the temporal lobe, is located just above the tentorium and the subarachnoid portion of CN&#160;III. Unilateral supratentorial mass lesions may force the uncus through the tentorial notch (uncal herniation) to compress the ipsilateral CN&#160;III.</p>
			<p class="body-text">At the back edge of the dura of the clivus and cavernous sinus, the nerve enters its own dural canal just above CN&#160;IV. Running forward in the superior lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, the nerve separates into 2&#160;divisions: (1)&#160;superior and (2)&#160;inferior. These divisions enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure within the annulus of Zinn. The superior division runs forward intraconally to innervate first the superior rectus muscle and then the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The inferior division sends parasympathetic fibers to the ciliary ganglion in the orbital apex approximately 10&#160;mm anterior to the annulus of Zinn and lateral to the optic nerve. Within the ciliary ganglion, the fibers destined for the pupillary sphincter and the ciliary body synapse. The fibers subsequently accompany the branch destined for the inferior oblique muscle. There are approximately 9–10&#160;times as many fibers associated with accommodation innervating the ciliary body as there are fibers reaching the pupillary sphincter muscle. This disparity may be one reason for the development of light–near dissociation in Adie tonic pupil (see Fig&#160;1-33). The remaining branches of CN&#160;III within the orbit innervate the medial rectus and inferior rectus muscles.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The final common pathways that influence the position of the eye within the orbit are the numerous soft-&#173;tissue elements connected to the globe. In addition to the EOMs, these tissues include the optic nerve, Tenon capsule, blood vessels, and the conjunctiva anteriorly. Orbital anatomy is discussed in BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Of the 6&#160;EOMs, 4 are <span class="italic">rectus muscles</span> (lateral, medial, superior, and inferior), and 2 are oblique (superior and inferior). The rectus muscles originate—along with the levator palpebrae superioris muscle—at the annulus of Zinn, a condensation of tissue around the optic nerve at the orbital apex. They run forward within sheaths that are connected by intermuscular septa to pierce the posterior Tenon capsule and insert on the anterior sclera, at points variably posterior to the corneal limbus, increasing from the medial through the inferior and lateral to the superior <span class="italic">(spiral of Tillaux).</span> The rectus muscles are also maintained in position by septal attachments to the orbital periosteum that act as pulleys.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The 2&#160;<span class="italic">oblique muscles</span> insert on the posterior lateral aspect of the globe. The origin of the inferior oblique muscle is in the anteromedial periorbita near the posterior margin of the lacrimal fossa. The effective origin of the superior oblique muscle is the trochlea, a pulleylike structure located at the notch in the superior medial orbit. The superior oblique muscle runs anteriorly in the superior medial orbit to the trochlea, where its tendon reverses its direction of action.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The EOMs are of variable mass and cross section: The inferior oblique is the thinnest, and the medial rectus is the largest. Thus, with normal tonic innervation, the somewhat stronger medial rectus reduces the divergent phoria.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Each of the other muscles has primary, secondary, and tertiary functions that vary depending on the position of gaze (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-33</span>).

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although the importance of CNs II, III, IV, and VI is obvious, CNs&#160;V and VII also contribute significantly to normal ophthalmic function and are frequently involved in neuro-&#173;ophthalmic disorders. For example, proper functioning of CN&#160;V is essential for prevention of corneal damage. In addition, complete loss of corneal sensation may be accompanied by abnormal corneal epithelial growth (neurotrophic keratitis associated with loss of neural secreted growth factors).</p>
			<p class="h2">Trigeminal Nerve (Fifth Cranial Nerve)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The sensory nerve terminates within the <span class="italic">trigeminal nucleus.</span> The nuclear complex of CN&#160;V extends from the midbrain to the cervical spinal cord and includes a main sensory nucleus, a mesencephalic nucleus, and a spinal nucleus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-34</span>). The <span class="italic">main sensory nucleus</span> is located within the pons lateral to the motor nucleus (the most rostral portion of the trigeminal complex except for the mesencephalic nucleus) and receives light-touch information from the skin of the face and the mucous membranes. The <span class="italic">mesencephalic nucleus</span> serves proprioception and deep sensation from the facial muscles, including the EOMs and the muscles involved in mastication (temporalis, pterygoid, and masseter). In addition, a <span class="italic">spinal nucleus</span> extends caudally to the level of the C4 vertebra, receiving pain and temperature information. The various sensory nuclei of CN&#160;V project to the contralateral thalamus and from there to the postcentral gyrus. The <span class="italic">motor nucleus</span> of CN&#160;V lies in the pons, medial to the sensory nucleus. The motor nucleus sends signals to the muscles of mastication, the tensor tympani (which dampens sound by tensing the tympanic membrane within the middle ear as a reflex response to loud noises), the tensor veli palatini (which orients the uvula), the mylohyoid, and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The fascicles of CN&#160;V enter the brainstem ventrally in the pons and extra-&#173;axially traverse the subarachnoid space to penetrate the dura just over the petrous pyramid. Within the subarachnoid space, the trigeminal root often comes in contact with the SCA. This proximity may be a cause of trigeminal neuralgia (atypical facial pain, discussed in Chapter&#160;12) and is the anatomical basis for microvascular decompression. The 3&#160;divisions of CN&#160;V synapse in the trigeminal (gasserian) ganglion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-35</span>), located in an extradural space at the floor of the middle cranial fossa (Meckel cave).</p>

It runs forward within the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus just below CN&#160;IV. As it approaches the superior orbital fissure extradurally, it divides into 3&#160;major branches: (1)&#160;lacrimal, (2)&#160;frontal, and (3)&#160;nasociliary. In addition, small branches innervate the dura of the anterior middle cranial fossa, including the cavernous sinus, the parasellar region, the tentorium, and the dura of the petrous apex. These branches also innervate the floor of the anterior cranial fossa, including the falx cerebri and the major blood vessels at the skull base.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The lacrimal and frontal nerves enter the orbital apex outside the annulus of Zinn. At its terminus, the frontal nerve divides into supraorbital and supratrochlear branches, which innervate the forehead, frontal sinus, and upper eyelid (including the conjunctiva). The lacrimal nerve also runs anteriorly in the superior lateral orbit just above the lateral rectus to innervate the lacrimal gland and the skin just superotemporal to the orbit. The nasociliary branch is the only branch that enters the intraconal space through the annulus of Zinn. The nasociliary branch runs through the ciliary ganglion and anteriorly to innervate the globe through the short and long posterior ciliary nerves. Prior to reaching the globe, branches from the nasociliary division pass through the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina to innervate part of the ethmoidal sinuses, the lateral wall of the nose, and the skin of the nose to the nasal tip. This co-&#173;innervation of the globe and the nasal skin is the reason behind the development of Hutchinson sign (vesicles on the tip or side of nose) in patients with zoster ophthalmicus.</p>

Before entering the canal, CN V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> gives off the middle meningeal nerve, which supplies the dura of the lateral middle cranial fossa. On the anterior end of the foramen rotundum, CN V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> enters the pterygomaxillary area. Two large pterygopalatine nerves supply sensation to the nasopharynx, hard and soft palate, and portions of the nasal cavity. Posterior alveolar nerves supply sensation to the upper gums and molars. The zygomatic nerve enters the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure and divides into the zygomaticofacial and the zygomaticotemporal nerves, which supply sensation to the lateral face (see Fig&#160;1-35). The maxillary nerve continues anteriorly within a canal between the orbit above and the maxillary sinus below to exit through the infraorbital foramen (as the infraorbital nerve) just below the inferior orbital rim. It subsequently divides into palpebral, nasal, and labial branches. The maxillary division provides sensation to the cheek as well as the lower eyelid and upper teeth and gums.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">CN&#160;VII is responsible for the movement of the facial muscles. Voluntary facial movements, along with other motor activity, originate in the <span class="italic">precentral gyrus.</span> White-matter tracts pass through the internal capsule and cerebral peduncles along with the other corticobulbar fibers. The motoneurons destined for the upper face receive information from both sides (bilateral innervation), whereas the lower facial musculature receives information only from the contralateral cortex (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-36</span>). The CN&#160;VII nucleus receives additional information from BG extrapyramidal connections, which are largely responsible for involuntary blinking. Abnormal blinking, as present in BG disorders such as Parkinson disease, is probably mediated through alterations in inhibition of the supranuclear control of the blink reflex.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The motor fibers of the CN&#160;VII nucleus originate in the tegmentum of the caudal pons, ventrolateral to the CN&#160;VI nucleus and medial to the spinal nucleus of CN&#160;V. The dorsal subnucleus receives bilateral innervation and supplies the upper face; the lateral subnucleus (contralateral innervation) supplies the lower face. The fascicles of CN&#160;VII pass dorsomedially to surround the CN&#160;VI nucleus, creating a bump on the floor of the fourth ventricle (the genu of CN&#160;VII intra-&#173;axially and the colliculus of CN&#160;VII on the floor of the fourth ventricle). CN&#160;VII exits the ventrolateral surface of the pons along with fascicles of the nervus intermedius, which contains the facial nerve sensory fibers and the visceral efferent fibers (see the section Parasympathetic Pathways later in this chapter). The subarachnoid portion of the nerve runs anteriorly and laterally to enter the internal auditory meatus along with CN&#160;VIII.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Within the petrous bone, CN&#160;VII enters the fallopian canal and traverses 3&#160;segments (the labyrinthine, the tympanic, and the mastoid) that run in close proximity to the semicircular canals. The parasympathetic fibers destined for the lacrimal gland separate from CN&#160;VII in the region of the geniculate ganglion to accompany the greater superficial petrosal nerve. The stapedial nerve exits to innervate the stapedius muscle, and the chorda tympani conducts parasympathetic innervation to the submaxillary gland and afferent fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. These special afferent fibers are responsible for taste in the anterior tongue and synapse in the geniculate ganglion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The main branch of CN&#160;VII exits the stylomastoid foramen just behind the styloid process at the base of the mastoid. The extracranial trunk of the nerve passes between the superficial and deep lobes of the parotid gland, where it divides into 2&#160;trunks: (1)&#160;the temporofacial superiorly and (2)&#160;the smaller cervicofacial inferiorly. These variably divide into 5&#160;major sub-&#173;branches: (1)&#160;temporal, (2)&#160;zygomatic, (3)&#160;buccal, (4)&#160;mandibular, and (5)&#160;cervical. The temporal and zygomatic branches laterally innervate the orbicularis oculi muscles. The infraorbital and buccal branches may also variably contribute to the inferior orbicularis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Eyelids</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The muscles of the eyelids are divided into 2&#160;components: (1)&#160;orbital (responsible for forced closure) and (2)&#160;palpebral. The palpebral muscles are further separated into pretarsal (predominantly intermediate fast-twitch fibers responsible for normal blinks) and preseptal muscles. This separation occurs at the upper eyelid fold, located approximately 6–7&#160;mm above the eyelid margin. The superior eyelid fold is formed by collateral insertion of the levator aponeurosis to the skin of the eyelid. Closure of the eyelids is marked by an increase in activity of the orbicularis muscle and inhibition of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The balance of tonic orbicularis and active levator activity determines the amount of eyelid opening. For discussion of eyelid abnormalities encountered in neuro-&#173;ophthalmic practice, see Chapter&#160;11. For further discussion of eyelid anatomy, including illustrations, see BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>

			<div id="Chapt1_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Branches of the parasympathetic system play a role in lacrimal function, and pupil size is controlled by a balance between the innervation of the sympathetic fibers to the iris dilator muscles and of the parasympathetic fibers to the sphincter muscles. The accessory retractor muscles, including the Müller muscle in the upper eyelid, receive sympathetic innervation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Sympathetic Pathways</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sympathetic activity originates in the posterolateral region of the hypothalamus. Activity in the hypothalamus is influenced by signals in the frontal, sensorimotor, and occipital cortex and in the limbic system (cingulate gyrus). The course of sympathetic fibers destined for the orbit is divided into first-, second-, and third-&#173;order segments (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-37</span>). Axons destined for the dilator muscles of the pupil and Müller muscle descend as the first-&#173;order segment, along with other sympathetic fibers, superficially in the anteromedial column through the brainstem to the spinal cord. Within the cervical spinal cord, the sympathetic fibers continue in the intermediolateral column. From levels C8 to T2, the sympathetic fibers destined for the orbit synapse in the ciliospinal center of Budge-&#173;Waller.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The postsynaptic second-&#173;order fibers leave the spinal cord through the ventral rami of the cervical (C8) and upper thoracic (T1 and T2) levels before joining the paravertebral sympathetic plexus. Ascending rostrally, the sympathetic chain passes in the anterior loop of the ansa subclavia proximate to the innominate artery on the right and the subclavian artery on the left just above the lung apex. These fibers pass through the inferior and middle cervical ganglia to terminate in the superior cervical ganglion, at the level of the angle of the jaw (C2) and the carotid artery bifurcation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The postganglionic third-&#173;order fibers continue in the wall of the bifurcated carotid. Sympathetic fibers innervating the sweat glands of the lower face follow the ECA.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The sympathetic fibers destined for the pupil continue along the ICA, entering the cranium through the carotid canal. Some sympathetic fibers leave the carotid artery as it exits the petrous bone, combining with the greater superficial petrosal nerve to form the <span class="italic">vidian nerve.</span> These sympathetic fibers parallel the parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal gland. Within the cavernous sinus, sympathetic fibers destined for the dilator muscles leave the carotid in conjunction with CN&#160;VI for a few millimeters. Further anteriorly in the cavernous sinus, the sympathetic fibers join the nasociliary branch of CN&#160;V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>. In the orbital apex, the fibers then pass through the ciliary ganglion (without synapsing). Along with the nasociliary branch, the sympathetic fibers reach the globe and travel with the long ciliary nerves to the dilator muscles of the pupil. The dilator muscle lies just superficial to the posterior pigment epithelium of the iris, which continues peripherally as the nonpigmented superficial layer of the ciliary body. The myoepithelial cells measure approximately 12.5&#160;µm in thickness, with an apical epithelial portion and a basilar muscular portion that is oriented radially toward the pupillary opening. The muscular processes terminate peripheral to the sphincter muscle. Peripherally at the iris root, these cells are continuous with the pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The fibers destined for the Müller muscle travel along the OphA and its subsequent frontal and lacrimal branches. The Müller muscle originates near the origin of the levator aponeurosis and inserts 10–12&#160;mm inferiorly on the superior border of the tarsus. The superior orbital sympathetic fibers also innervate the sweat glands of the forehead. Thus, disruption of these sympathetic fibers is responsible for the mild ptosis and the frontal anhidrosis associated with distal Horner syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Parasympathetic Pathways</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Parasympathetic activity originates in various areas within the brainstem. The fibers that control the pupil sphincter muscles originate in the Edinger-&#173;Westphal (EW) nuclei of the CN&#160;III nuclear complex within the midbrain. The main input to the EW nuclei is from the pretectal nuclei, both directly and via the PC. The pretectal nuclei, in turn, receive input directly from the afferent visual pathways via the pupillary tract, which leaves the optic tract in the brachium of the SC just anterior to the LGN (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;1-38</span>). The cortex (especially the frontal lobes), the hypothalamus, and the reticular activating system provide tonic inhibitory signals to the EW nucleus. During sleep, the pupil becomes smaller through loss of this inhibitory activity. In addition, the EW nucleus receives input from the more ventral and rostral midbrain, probably related to bitemporal image disparity that serves as a stimulus for convergence and the near reflex.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The parasympathetic fibers and the CN&#160;III fascicles leave the CN&#160;III nucleus and exit in the interpeduncular fossa. Within the subarachnoid space, the parasympathetic fibers tend to run on the medial superficial surface of CN&#160;III. When CN&#160;III bifurcates in the anterior cavernous sinus, the parasympathetic fibers travel with the inferior division. In the orbital apex, these fibers synapse in the ciliary ganglion (as opposed to the oculosympathetic and nasociliary fibers, which travel through the ganglion without synapse). The postsynaptic fibers then travel with the branch destined for the inferior oblique muscle, joining the posterior ciliary nerves to reach the anterior segment and the iris sphincter muscles. The sphincter muscle measures approximately 0.8&#160;mm in diameter and 0.15&#160;mm in thickness. It travels circumferentially around the pupillary margin just anterior to the posterior pigmented epithelium and central to the termination of the dilator muscle cells. The muscle itself is made up of units composed of groups of 5–8&#160;muscle cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland originates in the superior salivatory (salivary) nucleus located in the caudal pons posterolateral to the motor nucleus of CN&#160;VII. This nucleus receives sensory input from CN&#160;V and additional afferent fibers from the hypothalamus. Efferent parasympathetic fibers for lacrimal, mucous, and salivary secretion exit the nucleus, joining other parasympathetic efferent fibers coming from the salivatory nucleus and running with afferent gustatory fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue in the nervus intermedius. The gustatory fibers synapse in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius parallel to the fascicles of CN&#160;VII in the nervus intermedius (see Fig&#160;1-36B). This nerve joins with CN&#160;VII to exit the brainstem on its ventral surface of the pontomedullary junction. Together with the other fascicles of CN&#160;VII, the parasympathetic fibers of the nervus intermedius run laterally to the internal auditory meatus. Within the petrous bone and fallopian canal, the parasympathetic fibers exit at the geniculate ganglion and then travel superficially over the petrous bone with the greater superficial petrosal nerve. This course parallels that of the ICA. In the area where the ICA turns to rise into the cavernous sinus, the fibers join the vidian nerve, which then travels through the sphenoid bone parallel to and beneath the foramen rotundum to enter the pterygomaxillary space. The fibers synapse in the sphenopalatine ganglion. The postganglionic fibers travel superiorly through the inferior orbital fissure and then with the lacrimal nerve to reach the lacrimal gland. The parasympathetic fibers are responsible for reflex tearing.</p>

The pathways for the upper one-third of facial function (brow and orbicularis muscles) run parallel to but apparently distinct from the pathways for the lower two-thirds along the pyramidal tracts. The corticobulbar fibers travel in the basis pontis; those that control the lower facial muscles decussate at the level of the pons to synapse on the contralateral CN&#160;VII nucleus. Corticobulbar fibers that control the upper facial muscles decussate to synapse on the contralateral CN&#160;VII nucleus, and some of the fibers do not cross, reaching the ipsilateral CN&#160;VII nucleus. </p>
