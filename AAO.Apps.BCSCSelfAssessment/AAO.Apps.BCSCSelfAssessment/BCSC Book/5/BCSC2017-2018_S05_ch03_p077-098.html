			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">History</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In cases of decreased vision, 3&#160;aspects of the patient’s history—in addition to the age of the patient—are crucial in determining the etiology:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">&#9;1.&#9;laterality of the vision loss</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;2.&#9;time course of the vision loss</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-3">&#9;3.&#9;symptoms associated with the vision loss</p>
			<p class="h2">Unilateral Versus Bilateral Involvement</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Establishing the laterality of the vision loss is essential to localization of the lesion. Unilateral vision loss typically indicates a lesion anterior to the chiasm, whereas bilateral vision loss may reflect a bilateral ocular, chiasmal, or retrochiasmal lesion or a systemic process. Patients reporting vision loss should be asked whether they have checked each eye individually. A patient with a right homonymous hemianopia may mistake the temporal visual field defect as a problem with the vision of the right eye only. Binocular involvement might not be appreciated until the patient is examined.</p>
			<p class="h2">Time Course of Vision Loss</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Determining the speed of onset of vision loss can aid the clinician in determining the etiology of the problem. Sudden onset (ie, within minutes) usually indicates an ischemic event, such as arterial occlusion. A course that evolves over days to weeks more typically denotes inflammation. Gradual progression over months or years is typical of compressive lesions, toxic or nutritional optic neuropathies (although such lesions may present more acutely), and glaucoma. It is important to differentiate between sudden loss of vision and sudden awareness of vision loss. Patients may become acutely aware of a chronic processes only upon covering the uninvolved eye or only after the second eye becomes affected. Although the time course may suggest a cause of vision loss, the time courses of the various etiologies overlap considerably.</p>
			<p class="h2">Associated Symptoms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ipsilateral periorbital pain that increases with eye movement occurs commonly in optic neuritis. Associated neurologic symptoms may suggest demyelinating disease. Nonspecific pain, facial numbness, or diplopia may indicate an orbital or cavernous sinus lesion. Headache, jaw claudication, and systemic symptoms suggest giant cell arteritis (GCA).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Examination</p>
				<div id="Chapt3_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Examination of the patient with decreased vision requires performing a full neuro-&#173;ophthalmic evaluation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Visual Acuity Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA; also called <span class="italic">best-&#173;corrected visual acuity</span>) should be obtained with refraction. Vision improvement with pinhole viewing indicates a refractive error. For patients with visual acuity levels worse than 20/400, the clinician should quantify CDVA using a standard 20/200&#160;E optotype chart. The clinician records the distance at which the patient is able to discern the letter orientation using standard Snellen notation (eg, “5/200”). This test provides a more accurate and reproducible measurement than does the finger-&#173;counting method.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Distance and near corrected visual acuity should be similar; a disparity may suggest a specific pathology. The clinician should document the presence of eccentric fixation (possible central scotoma), tendency to read half of the eye chart (possible hemianopic field defect), or improvement in CDVA when reading single optotypes (which may suggest amblyopia).</p>
			<p class="h2">Color Vision Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Color vision testing complements visual acuity assessment. Optic nerve disease, particularly demyelinating optic neuritis, may disproportionately affect color vision compared with CDVA. In macular disease, visual acuity and color vision tend to decline correspondingly. Thus, an optic neuropathy is the more likely etiology than a maculopathy in the differential diagnosis for an eye with 20/30 visual acuity but with severe loss of color vision. In optic neuropathy, persistent dyschromatopsia can occur even after recovery of visual acuity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Color vision should be tested separately in each eye to detect unilateral disease. Because Ishihara pseudoisochromatic color plate testing is widely available, it is the commonly used method for color vision evaluation. Although the test was designed to detect congenital red-green color deficiencies, it may also identify acquired dyschromatopsia (though it may miss mild cases). Bilateral, symmetric color vision loss in men may signify congenital dyschromatopsia rather than bilateral optic neuropathies. The Hardy-Rand-&#173;Rittler (HRR) plates can be used to screen for tritan (ie, blue-&#173;yellow) defects as well as red-green defects. Blue-&#173;yellow color defects often accompany an optic neuropathy but also can occur in a maculopathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">More detailed color testing may comprehensively characterize a color vision defect. In the Farnsworth panel D-15&#160;test, the patient is asked to arrange 15&#160;colored discs in order of hue and intensity. The Farnsworth-&#173;Munsell 100-hue test, which uses 85&#160;colored discs, is the most detailed test and provides the best discrimination. This test requires a substantial amount of time to test and score, thereby limiting its use in routine clinical testing. Color vision testing is discussed further in BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>

			<p class="h2">Pupillary Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Normally, light directed at 1&#160;pupil causes equal constriction of both pupils (see Chapters&#160;1 and 10). When light is shined into an eye with impaired conduction of the afferent pupillomotor signal along 1&#160;optic nerve, pupillary constriction in both eyes is slower and smaller in amplitude compared with the response that occurs when light is shined into the eye with normal optic nerve conduction. In other words, both the direct and the consensual response are sluggish. This difference between the 2&#160;eyes in pupillary response after light stimulation is known as a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most popular clinical method for detecting an RAPD is the swinging flashlight test (Video&#160;3-1). This test, which compares the pupillary response in the 2&#160;eyes when tested with the same light source, involves swinging a bright light (which is shined directly into the pupil along the visual axis) between the 2&#160;eyes. If the afferent input is significantly asymmetric, the pupils redilate immediately when the light is shined into the affected eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-1</span>).</p>

			<p class="body-text">An RAPD is an extremely reliable and sensitive indicator of optic nerve dysfunction. Its absence generally indicates either a lack of an optic neuropathy or of bilateral optic nerve involvement. Less commonly, an RAPD may also result from substantial retinal disease, such as a central retinal artery occlusion or retinal detachment. Chiasmal lesions may produce an RAPD secondary to asymmetric optic nerve involvement. In patients with a unilateral optic tract lesion, a mild RAPD may exist on the side of the temporal visual field defect. This has been explained by the difference in light sensitivity between the intact temporal and nasal hemifields. In addition, the proportion of fibers that cross (53%) is greater than the proportion of those that do not cross (47%). In rare cases, an RAPD may result from media opacities such as cataract or vitreous hemorrhage or from amblyopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Certain factors, such as dark irides or sluggish, dilated, or miotic pupils, can make it difficult to elicit an RAPD. In these circumstances, subjective sense of brightness and perceived color intensity can be used to identify and quantitatively grade an RAPD. Brightness sense testing requires a bright light source such as a muscle light or an indirect ophthalmoscope set at 6&#160;volts (V). Red perception testing requires a red target, such as the cap of a cycloplegic eyedrop bottle. The clinician directs the patient to look at the target, which is held 30&#160;cm from the eye and is exposed to each eye for the same length of time. The clinician then asks the patient whether the light is of equal brightness (or is equally red) in both eyes. If the patient indicates a difference between the eyes, the target is held in front of the “brighter” or “redder” eye first, before the target is switched to the other eye. The patient is asked, “If the light is 100% bright (the target is 100% red) in this eye, then what percentage is it in the other eye?”</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Fundus Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A fundus examination may reveal media opacities or fundus abnormalities that explain a patient’s decreased vision. The clarity of the view with the direct ophthalmoscope can suggest how much visual impairment is caused by these media opacities. Using either direct ophthalmoscopy or slit-lamp biomicroscopy, the clinician can assess the appearance of the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula. The ONH is examined for evidence of pallor, edema, excavation, or other abnormalities; the macula is examined for evidence of pigmentary disturbance, edema, scarring, or other disruption of structural integrity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">ONH pallor indicates optic atrophy, which is the hallmark of damage to the retinal ganglion cells. Although the examiner is only able to observe pallor of the neuroretinal rim, ONH pallor can occur from damage to any portion of the ganglion cells, from the ganglion cell bodies to their synapses at the lateral geniculate nucleus. ONH pallor does not occur immediately after injury but takes at least 4–6&#160;weeks from the time of axonal damage. Severe damage causes the ONH to appear chalky white (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-2</span>). Mild forms of pallor remain more difficult to detect. Evaluation of the capillary net, the network of fine blood vessels on the ONH, may be helpful; the net becomes thin or absent in early atrophy even when pallor is still very mild. In addition, dropout of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) may precede atrophy. When viewed with a red-free filter, fine defects appear as dark bands among normal striations. These defects, called <span class="italic">rake defects</span> owing to their similarity to rake marks in soil (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-3</span>), initially affect the thickest portion of the RNFL, the superior and inferior arcades. However, true temporal pallor must be carefully distinguished from the pallor of the ONH in a pseudophakic eye. If only 1&#160;eye is pseudophakic, the difficulty of comparing ONH pallor in the 2&#160;eyes makes this task particularly challenging.</p>
			<p class="body-text">ONH edema results from impaired axoplasmic flow from any cause, including increased intracranial pressure, local mechanical compression, ischemia, and inflammation. ONH and retinal vascular changes can also accompany ONH edema (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-4</span>). Regardless of cause, the following clinical features of ONH edema may be observed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">elevation of the ONH with variable filling in of the physiologic cup; retinal vessels may appear to drape over the elevated ONH margin</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">blurring of the ONH margins</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">peripapillary RNFL opacification; the RNFL becomes grayish white and opalescent with feathered margins, obscuring portions of the retinal vessels that course within this level of the retina</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">hyperemia and dilation of the ONH surface capillary net</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">retinal venous dilation and tortuosity</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">peripapillary hemorrhages, exudates, or cotton-wool spots</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-8">retinal or choroidal folds or macular edema</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Visual Field Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Evaluation of the visual field helps localize a lesion along the afferent visual pathway, defines patterns of vision loss, and quantifies the defect, enabling measurement of change over time. The choice of technique depends on the degree of detail required and the patient’s ability to cooperate. Patterns of visual field loss are discussed in detail in Chapter&#160;4.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Confrontation testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Confrontation testing, which is easily performed at a patient’s bedside or in the clinic, should take place during every ophthalmic examination. It is only a screening test and does not replace formal perimetry. The accuracy of confrontation testing depends on the density of the visual field defect. Accepted methods of confrontation testing include:</p>

The patient covers 1&#160;eye and fixates on the examiner’s nose. The examiner asks the patient whether he or she is unable to see specific parts of the examiner’s face. Affirmative responses may aid in identifying central or altitudinal (superior or inferior hemifield) visual field defects.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Finger counting in the 4 quadrants.</span> The patient is asked to count 1 or 2&#160;static fingers as they are presented sequentially in each of the 4&#160;quadrants. The fingers are presented approximately 20° eccentric to fixation and equidistant from the quadrant borders. This technique tests for both altitudinal defects of the anterior visual pathways and homonymous defects due to retrochiasmal lesions.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Kinetic red target test.</span> A 5-mm, red-topped pin is moved inward from beyond the boundary of each quadrant along a line bisecting the horizontal and vertical meridians. The patient is asked to report when the pin is first perceived to be red.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">Finger or red comparison test.</span> With the finger comparison test, the examiner’s index fingers are presented simultaneously on either side of the vertical meridian, first in the superior and then in the inferior quadrants. The patient is asked to report whether the fingers are equally in focus. During finger testing, children and nonverbal adults may be asked to mimic the examiner’s finger movements. If the patient cannot identify fingers to mimic finger movements, the examiner presents progressively stronger stimuli, such as hand movement or light perception in each quadrant. In the red comparison test, 2&#160;identical red targets are presented in the same manner as the fingers in the finger comparison test. The patient is asked whether the targets are equally red. Color may appear altered, washed out, or absent in a damaged hemifield. Slow movement of the target across the vertical meridian may identify an abnormality in color vision, which suggests damage to the chiasmal or retrochiasmal pathway.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Although these confrontation tests offer high sensitivity, their use is likely to result in many false-&#173;positives due to the low specificity of the tests. The single test with the best combination of sensitivity (74%) and specificity (93%) is kinetic testing with a red target.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Extinction</span> refers to the inability to see a target in an affected hemifield <span class="italic">only</span> during simultaneous stimulation of both hemifields.

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Amsler grid testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Amsler grid testing screens the central 20° of the visual field (10° from fixation). The patient, with optical correction for near vision as needed, holds the Amsler grid at one-third of a meter, covers 1&#160;eye, and looks at a fixation point in the center of the grid without scanning the grid. The patient describes any areas of distortion (ie, metamorphopsia); such areas suggest macular rather than optic nerve disease. Peripheral “bending” of the grid may represent optical aberration from spectacles and should be disregarded. The patient can also identify any scotoma. Although Amsler grid testing is rapid and simple, its sensitivity is low.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Perimetry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Perimetry provides more detailed evaluation of the visual field. In both static and kinetic techniques, the visual field is analyzed for areas of decreased sensitivity, both in location and in degree. In <span class="italic">static</span> testing, stimuli turn on and off at designated points within the region of the visual field being tested. In <span class="italic">kinetic</span> testing, a stimulus moves from a nonseeing to a seeing area of the visual field to determine the location at which it is consistently detected by the patient. All points of equal sensitivity for a specific stimulus are connected to form an isopter, which represents the outer limit of visibility for that stimulus. Analysis of several isopters (plotted with different stimuli) produces a “contour map” of the island of vision.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-11"><span class="h4-head">Kinetic perimetry</span> Kinetic perimetry (eg, Goldmann perimetry, the kinetic program on an Octopus perimeter [Haag-Streit, Köniz, Switzerland]) can be used to evaluate the entire visual field. Stimuli of varying sizes and intensities are moved along each radial meridian from a peripheral to central location. Typically, 2 or 3&#160;isopters are plotted. Varying the stimulus size, intensity, and location can delineate the depths and borders of defects. Kinetic perimetry requires a skilled and knowledgeable perimetrist who can interact with patients to elicit optimal cooperation.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Automated static perimetry</span> Automated static perimetry is considered the gold standard for evaluating visual field defects. Although this method is particularly difficult to use with older or inattentive patients, it possesses numerous advantages over manual kinetic perimetry techniques:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">standardized testing conditions, which improve serial and inter-&#173;institutional comparisons of results</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">less dependence on technicians</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">better sensitivity</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">numerical data amenable to statistical analysis for comparisons and clinical studies</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">results amenable to electronic data storage</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Most automated perimeters use static stimuli that are similar in size to the kinetic perimeter size&#160;III stimulus. The perimeter randomly presents stimuli at predetermined locations within a specified region of the visual field. Because nearly 80% of the visual cortex correlates to the central visual field, testing the central 24° or 30° of the visual field is typically adequate for detecting most visual defects (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-5</span>). It is also critical to measure the foveal threshold (the normal range is 30–37&#160;dB) because it estimates central visual function. Because of the 4° test spacing of the 30-2 and 24-2 programs, 10-2 perimetry may better delineate a small central or paracentral scotoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The stimuli vary in brightness, and patient responses determine the minimum visible stimulus at each location—the sensitivity threshold. This threshold is defined as the intensity of the dimmest target identified 50% of the time at a given location. For each region tested, the report displays the threshold value in decibels (on a logarithmic scale of intensity, measuring attenuation from the maximum stimulus of the perimeter). For a given stimulus location, a higher value indicates that the patient can see a dimmer stimulus, reflecting greater visual sensitivity at that location. The measured values are not absolute numbers and are not equivalent among perimeters because the machines have different maximum intensities, backgrounds, and durations of presentation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A symbolic representation of the threshold values, the grayscale map, depicts an overall topographic impression of the visual field data by using darker symbols for low-&#173;sensitivity points and lighter symbols for high-&#173;sensitivity points. The computer program interpolates between tested points to provide a user-&#173;friendly picture (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-6</span>). For clinical interpretation, the perimeter calculates for each value the statistical probability that the value falls outside the normal range among age-matched control subjects; the results are placed in a total-&#173;deviation plot. Optic neuropathy may cause substantial total-&#173;deviation depression with few or no pattern-&#173;deviation abnormalities. Because ocular media abnormalities (eg, refractive error, cataract) may depress the sensitivity of the entire visual field, the program produces a pattern-&#173;deviation plot by determining the sensitivity values for all points shifted (by the seventh-&#173;highest point) and reanalyzes them based on age-&#173;expected values. This reanalysis compensates for the overall sensitivity depression, allowing recognition of abnormal patterns (eg, scotomata, arcuate defects, homonymous defects) that might have been otherwise masked. Abnormal values are depicted topographically according to statistical probability: Darker squares represent higher probability, and lighter squares represent lower probability.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The long duration and repetitiveness of the original full-&#173;threshold perimetry test can fatigue patients, reducing the accuracy of the test results. Use of the Swedish interactive threshold algorithm (SITA) shortens the time needed to complete the full-&#173;threshold test by half but maintains the accuracy necessary for validity. (See BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma.</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text">The reliability of perimetry test results is assessed by identifying the following patient response characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-12"><span class="italic">false-positive response rate:</span> how frequently the patient signals when no target is displayed (The acceptable rate is typically &lt;25% on threshold testing and &lt;15% on SITA testing.)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">false-negative response rate:</span> how often the patient fails to signal when a target brighter than the previously determined threshold for that spot is displayed (The acceptable rate is typically &lt;25%, but the rate increases in regions of true visual field loss, because the patient is unable to reproduce responses accurately.)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-13"><span class="italic">fixation losses:</span> how often the patient identifies the stimulus in the previously plotted physiologic blind spot (an unexpected response), indicating that the eye is not aligned with the fixation target</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Global indices are calculated to help determine changes in sensitivity over time. Such indices include a center-&#173;weighted mean of the sensitivity depressions across all points (ie, mean deviation) and different methods of addressing localized defects (eg, pattern standard deviation, corrected pattern deviation, loss variance).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Adjunct Testing</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Contrast sensitivity testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Whereas visual acuity testing uses targets that vary in size but have a single high level of contrast, contrast sensitivity testing uses targets with varying contrast levels. Two types of contrast sensitivity tests exist: (1)&#160;grating tests and (2)&#160;letter tests. Grating tests display rows of sine wave grating patches, each row reflecting a different spatial frequency. Grating tests, although arguably superior to letter tests, are difficult to administer and to reproduce reliably. The Pelli-&#173;Robson chart, which is commonly used for clinical letter testing, consists of letters of a fixed size that vary in contrast. The minimum level of contrast at which the letters can be detected is recorded.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Contrast sensitivity testing can detect and quantify vision loss in the presence of normal visual acuity. Such testing, however, is not specific for optic nerve dysfunction; media irregularities and macular lesions may also yield abnormal results. Interpretation of contrast sensitivity test data is more complex than interpretation of visual acuity data, particularly with regard to differentiating subtle abnormalities from normal presentation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Contrast sensitivity testing is discussed further in BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Photostress recovery testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The photostress recovery test may help differentiate vision loss caused by a macular lesion or ocular ischemia from that caused by an optic neuropathy. CDVA is measured (a visual acuity of 20/80 or better is required). Tested monocularly, the patient gazes directly into a strong light held 2–3&#160;cm from the eye for 10&#160;seconds. As soon as possible after the light is removed, the patient attempts to read the next larger Snellen visual acuity line above the line representing the patient’s CDVA (eg, a patient with a CDVA of 20/25 attempts to read the 20/30 line). Normal photostress recovery time is less than 30&#160;seconds, but patients with maculopathy or severe carotid artery stenosis have prolonged recovery times, frequently 90–180&#160;seconds or more. Patients with optic neuropathy maintain normal photostress recovery times.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Potential acuity meter testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Potential acuity meter (PAM) testing can help determine whether media irregularities or opacities are the cause of decreased vision. Optotypes are projected onto the retina through a dilated pupil, providing an estimate of best potential visual acuity. If the visual acuity does not improve to 20/20 with PAM, the ophthalmologist should search for a cause other than media opacities, such as optic neuropathy or maculopathy.

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Fluorescein angiography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fluorescein angiography may have a role in the investigation of some optic neuropathies. Angiographic leakage can differentiate true edema from pseudoedema of the ONH (the latter does not leak). Pseudoedema is characteristic of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. Angiography may also demonstrate delayed or absent choroidal filling. This finding may explain vision loss due to choroidal ischemia, which strongly indicates a diagnosis of GCA (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-7</span>). Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography may facilitate better assessment of choroidal blood flow and reveal deep inflammatory lesions. For further discussion of fluorescein angiography, see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Fundus autofluorescence</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fundus autofluorescence uses the same excitation and emission filters as fluorescein angiography but does not require injection of a contrast dye. ONH drusen are visible with autofluorescence (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-8</span>). Lipofuscin, which accumulates in higher amounts in damaged retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, causes hyperfluorescence. This is seen in some retinal pathologies, such as multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS), acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN), acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR), and acute idiopathic blind-spot enlargement (AIBSE). Because funduscopic abnormalities in these conditions are often subtle, they are commonly mistaken for an optic neuropathy, which makes fundus autofluorescence a valuable diagnostic tool in this clinical setting.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Optical coherence tomography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides noninvasive, high-&#173;resolution, in situ visualization of the retinal layers and ONH. OCT can be very helpful in the evaluation and management of certain neuro-&#173;ophthalmic conditions. OCT is useful for structural measurement of peripapillary RNFL thickness, volumetric analysis of the ONH, and evaluation of macular anatomy. The measurement of the RNFL thickness provides indirect information regarding the axonal integrity of the optic nerve. In several optic neuropathies, the degree and the site of RNFL thinning correlate with the threshold sensitivity of the corresponding area of the visual field (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;3-9, 3-10</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">OCT predicts the potential for visual recovery after surgery in patients with compressive chiasmal tumors. Patients who have significant visual field defects but preserved RNFL thickness (the threshold is approximately 75&#160;µm but depends on age) typically recover excellently, irrespective of the degree of preoperative vision loss.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Automatic segmentation of the macula on OCT allows measurement of the inner retina (RNFL, ganglion cell layer, and inner plexiform layers), referred to as the <span class="italic">ganglion cell complex (GCC).</span> In patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) or other optic neuropathies, GCC thickness better correlates with visual acuity and quality of life than does RNFL thickness.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Macular cube OCT and macular line scans can help identify occult retinal pathology that mimics optic nerve disease. For example, subretinal fluid from central serous retinopathy may be mistaken for optic neuritis. MEWDS, AZOOR, and AMN can be detected with OCT owing to the disruption of the inner and outer segments of the retina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-11</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">OCT also has a role in monitoring disease progression. As in glaucoma, the RNFL thickness can be monitored over time in patients with chronic diseases such as MS and compressive optic neuropathy to quantify axonal loss (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-12</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A clinical challenge often encountered in neuro-&#173;ophthalmology is differentiation among anomalous optic nerves, ONH drusen, and papilledema. Several OCT features may suggest the diagnosis; however, OCT currently cannot definitively distinguish mild papilledema from an anomalous, crowded ONH or buried ONH drusen.</p>
			<p class="body-text">OCT has limitations. Many of the abnormalities seen on OCT are not specific to a particular disease process. For example, thinning of the RNFL occurs with any optic neuropathy. RNFL loss plateaus around 40–50&#160;µm; further loss is undetectable. The wide variability in RNFL values means that some patients have statistically abnormal results that are in fact normal for them. See BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> for more information.</p>

			<p class="h3">Ultrasonography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ultrasonography is useful in diagnosing buried ONH drusen, which are hyperechoic on B-scan. Ultrasonography is more sensitive for ONH drusen than is autofluorescence or computed tomography. Ultrasound is also helpful in diagnosing scleritis, which can mimic optic neuritis. Patients with papilledema can have a positive 30° test, in which the diameter of the optic nerve sheath decreases when the patient is asked to fixate 30° away from primary gaze.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Electrophysiologic testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When the patient has central or peripheral vision loss but no obvious fundus abnormality, ancillary electrophysiologic testing may help confirm or rule out occult abnormalities of the optic nerve or retinal function. See BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-15"><span class="h4-head">Visual evoked potential testing</span> Visual evoked potential (VEP) testing measures electrical signals produced in response to a visual stimulus; the signals are recorded at the scalp overlying the occipital cortex. Damage anywhere along the afferent visual pathway can reduce the amplitude or speed of the signal. Because the central visual field predominates in the occipital cortex, isolated peripheral vision loss may yield normal VEP results.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common stimulus used for VEP testing is a checkerboard target with a pattern that reverses every half-second. The pattern size may also vary, with smaller pattern sizes allowing detection of smaller changes in function. If patients with poor vision cannot easily see a pattern stimulus, a flash stimulus may be used instead. The response from the checkerboard pattern provides a more quantifiable and reliable VEP waveform.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common wave measured in VEP testing is the P100 wave, which occurs 100&#160;milliseconds after stimulus onset in patients with normal vision. The P100 <span class="italic">latency</span> and, to a lesser degree, the <span class="italic">amplitude</span> are the most useful features analyzed. Demyelination has a greater effect on the latency of the P100 waveform than on its amplitude. Ischemic, compressive, or toxic optic nerve damage primarily reduces amplitude, with less effect on latency. A normal VEP (especially in response to a checkerboard pattern stimulus with a high spatial frequency) is evidence for a nonorganic etiology in a patient who reports severe vision loss. However, an abnormal VEP does not prove pathology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The VEP test has significant limitations. It is subject to influence by numerous factors that may produce abnormal waveforms despite normal visual pathways, including uncorrected refractive error, media opacities, amblyopia, fatigue, and inattention (intentional or unintentional). Although an abnormal VEP may indicate visual pathway dysfunction, the differential effects on latency versus amplitude may not be sensitive or specific enough to narrow the differential diagnosis. The VEP is clinically useful in 2&#160;situations: (1)&#160;evaluation of the visual pathway in an inarticulate patient and (2)&#160;confirmation of intact visual pathways in a patient with suspected nonorganic disease. A consistently abnormal flash response in an infant or inarticulate adult reflects gross impairment. An abnormal pattern response may indicate damage or may be a false-&#173;negative result for the reasons just cited. Normal responses confirm intact visual pathways.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Electroretinography</span> The electroretinogram (ERG) measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to various light stimuli under different states of light adaptation. Electrical activity is measured at the corneal surface by electrodes embedded in a corneal contact lens worn for testing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The full-field ERG response is generated by stimulating the entire retina with a light source under varying conditions of retinal adaptation. Major components of the electrical waveform that are generated and measured include the <span class="italic">a-wave,</span> derived primarily from the photoreceptor layer; the <span class="italic">b-wave,</span> derived from the inner retina, probably Müller and on-&#173;bipolar cells; and the <span class="italic">c-wave,</span> derived from the RPE and photoreceptors. The examiner can separate rod and cone photoreceptor responses by varying the stimuli and the state of retinal adaptation during testing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ERG is useful in detecting diffuse retinal disease in cases of generalized or peripheral vision loss. Disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa (including the forms without pigmentation), cone–rod dystrophy, toxic retinopathies, and the retinal paraneoplastic syndromes (cancer-&#173;associated retinopathy [CAR]) and melanoma-&#173;associated retinopathy [MAR]) may present with variably severe vision loss and minimal visible ocular abnormality. Invariably, the ERG pattern is severely depressed by the time substantial vision loss has occurred, and thus testing is extremely useful. The full-field test, however, measures only a mass response of the entire retina; minor or localized retinal disease, particularly maculopathy, even with severe visual acuity loss, might not produce an abnormal response.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">The multifocal ERG</span> (mfERG) simultaneously records and topographically maps ERG signals from up to 250&#160;focal retinal locations within the central 30° (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-13</span>). Because it is a light-&#173;adapted test, an mfERG tests the cone system. Further, because it does not rely on a mass retinal response, as does a full-field ERG, an mfERG is very useful in detecting occult focal retinal abnormalities, especially early cone and cone–rod dystrophies. This technique can differentiate optic nerve from macular disease in occult central vision loss, because the signal generally remains normal in optic nerve disease. Also, causes of outer retinal degeneration, such as MEWDS, AIBSE, and AZOOR, result in changes in the mfERG. See BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span></p>

			<p class="sidebar-numbered-list-mid">1.&#9;Dim the ambient lighting; it is easier to evaluate pupillary movement when the pupil size is larger.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;Ask the patient to fixate at distance to avoid pupillary miosis from accommodation.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;Use a well-charged, bright, steady source of diffuse light, such as a standard “muscle light.” A light source that is too dim or too bright may produce false-&#173;positive or false-&#173;negative results, respectively.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-numbered-list-mid">4.&#9;Stimulate 1&#160;eye for 2–3&#160;seconds, then quickly move across the bridge of the nose to stimulate the other eye for 2–3&#160;seconds. Alternate several times. Do not rely on a single observation.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-numbered-list-mid">5.&#9;Observe the initial pupillary constriction (velocity and amplitude) and any pupillary dilation. A dense RAPD is easily detected <br />because an affected eye’s pupil dilates when stimulated. A mild-<br />to-moderate RAPD is more difficult to detect because the abnormal pupil may still constrict, but less vigorously than the normal pupil.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-numbered-list-mid">6.&#9;If 1 pupil does not react (eg, due to iris trauma, synechiae, or pharmacologic mydriasis or miosis), evaluate the direct and consensual responses of the functioning pupil. This may demonstrate the asymmetry of responses and indicate the side of the RAPD (see Fig&#160;3-1).</p>
			<p class="sidebar-numbered-list-last">7.&#9;Grade the RAPD 1–4+ in increasing severity or quantify it using neutral-&#173;density filters. The filters, placed in front of the unaffected eye, decrease the intensity of the light stimulus. Beginning with the lowest 0.3&#160;log<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">10</span> unit, repeat the swinging flashlight test. If an RAPD is still detected, place increasingly stronger filters over the unaffected eye until the RAPD “disappears.” At this balance point, the light input from the unaffected eye with the filter matches the light input from the abnormal eye. Quantify the RAPD by the strength of the neutral-&#173;density filter needed over the unaffected eye to reach the balance point.</p>

			<p class="sidebar-text">The RAPD magnitude correlates with the degree of damage to retinal ganglion cells and their axons. However, a prominent RAPD can occur with normal visual acuity if significant visual field damage is present.</p>
			<p class="sidebar-text">An RAPD in patients with an optic neuropathy does not cause anisocoria.</p>
