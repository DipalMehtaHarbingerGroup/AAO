			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyelid abnormalities and facial movement disorders are frequently encountered in ophthalmology. Many such problems are neurologic in origin and therefore require careful evaluation. A thorough history of the presenting complaints is essential, as is documentation of concomitant medical conditions. Although most patients are aware of an abnormality in the position or function of the eyelid, some may present instead with a chief concern of visual difficulties (eg, visual loss from ptosis) or pain (eg, exposure keratopathy from facial palsy). Occasionally, patients will attribute the problem to the wrong eye, for example mistaking ptosis for contralateral eyelid retraction, or widening of the palpebral fissure for contralateral ptosis. The clinician should ask about onset and duration of symptoms, as well as associated symptoms. In addition, the clinician should perform a careful evaluation of eyelid function and facial movements along with a thorough ophthalmic examination. Diagnosis and management of eyelid disorders are discussed at greater length in BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Examination Techniques</p>
				<div id="Chapt11_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An examination of the eyelids begins by observing their general shape and appearance (eg, an S&#160;shape may indicate pathology affecting the lacrimal gland or neurofibromatosis [<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-1</span>; see also Chapter&#160;14]) and blink rate (eg, low in Parkinson disease and high in blepharospasm), and by noting abnormal movements (eg, synkinesis with other facial muscles). If the ptosis is unilateral, the clinician should verify that it is not an artifact of vertical strabismus (eg, hypotropia; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-2</span>) or contralateral eyelid retraction. The eyelids should be everted for examination to rule out a local cause of ptosis, such as retained contact lens or giant papillary conjunctivitis. If the ptosis is asymmetric, the clinician should manually raise the ptotic eyelid to see if the higher eyelid drops to a new position (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">When evaluating a patient with ptosis, the clinician should obtain the following 5&#160;important clinical measurements:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-3">&#9;1.&#9;levator palpebrae superioris muscle function</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;2.&#9;margin–reflex distance</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;3.&#9;vertical palpebral fissure height</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;4.&#9;upper eyelid crease position</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">&#9;5.&#9;lagophthalmos amount (if present)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Descriptions of these measurements are provided in Chapter&#160;11 of BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, eyelid movement during target pursuit from upgaze to downgaze should be observed. Normally, such movement is smoothly accomplished, but lid lag may occur in patients with thyroid eye disease or as a result of aberrant regeneration of cranial nerve (CN)&#160;III (see Chapter&#160;7, Fig&#160;7-10).</p>
			<p class="body-text">To aid diagnoses of cases of suspected fatigable ptosis caused by myasthenia gravis, the patient can be asked to fixate on the clinician’s hand, which is elevated to provoke extreme upgaze. The clinician watches for progressive ptosis as the patient attempts to hold this position. A patient without myasthenia gravis can maintain the position without developing ptosis. The Cogan lid-twitch sign, a feature of myasthenia gravis, can be identified by having the patient fixate in downgaze for a few seconds and then rapidly refixate straight ahead. The sign appears as an upward overshoot of the eyelid followed by fluttering as the eyelid settles into position (videos of lid twitch and lid twitch sign are available at The Neuro-Ophthalmology Virtual Education Library [NOVEL] website at <span class="url">http://novel.utah.edu</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Evaluation of facial motor function includes assessing the strength of the orbicularis oculi and other facial muscles. Eyelid closure should be assessed to determine if it is incomplete (lagophthalmos). Reinnervation phenomena, such as synkinesis with eyelid closure and facial tics, may be signs of a previous injury to CN&#160;VII (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-4</span>). The clinician should note the presence of exophthalmos (eg, thyroid eye disease) or enophthalmos. Enophthalmos may result in apparent ptosis and narrowing of the palpebral fissure because the eyelid follows the contour of the globe as the eye retracts into the orbit. Anisocoria (see Chapter&#160;10) may suggest sympathetic nervous system disruption, which will alter eyelid position. Dysfunction of CN&#160;III with parasympathetic nervous system involvement may also present with ptosis and anisocoria, as well as an ocular motility deficit. Finally, “neighboring” CNs should be assessed. If ptosis is caused by CN&#160;III weakness, the functions of CN&#160;IV, CN&#160;V, and CN&#160;VI should also be evaluated. Ocular motility should be checked for subtle weakness. Similarly, if CN&#160;VII dysfunction is found, facial sensation and hearing should be evaluated.</p>

				<div id="Chapt11_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Congenital Ptosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common form of congenital ptosis is thought to result from dystrophic development of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle without associated innervational abnormalities. Congenital ptosis is typically associated with decreased levator function, lid lag on downgaze, and poorly formed (or absent) upper eyelid crease. Congenital ptosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-5</span>) may be unilateral or bilateral and may be associated with other congenital ocular or orbital abnormalities, including blepharophimosis syndrome, congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles, superior rectus weakness or overaction, and Marcus Gunn jaw-&#173;winking syndrome (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-6</span>). This last phenomenon is a synkinetic movement of the eyelid associated with jaw movement. In the external pterygoid–levator form of the syndrome, the eyelid elevates with movement of the mandible to the opposite side, jaw protrusion, or wide opening of the mouth. With the internal pterygoid–levator form, the eyelid elevates when the teeth are clenched. In some patients with Marcus Gunn jaw-&#173;winking syndrome, ptosis may worsen with movement of the jaw, although this finding is not common. Congenital tumors, such as hemangiomas and neurofibromas (see Fig&#160;11-1) may also lead to congenital ptosis. Such tumors are typically associated with a palpable mass. Congenital CN&#160;III palsy and congenital Horner syndrome are relatively rare causes of congenital neurogenic ptosis. Whatever the origin of a child’s congenital ptosis, the ophthalmologist must be aware of the potential for amblyopia as a result of occlusion or anisometropia.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Acquired Ptosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-table">Table&#160;11-1</span> lists the most common causes of acquired ptosis. <span class="italic">Neurogenic ptosis</span> requires careful attention to associated abnormalities in pupillary size and extraocular movements. Bilateral ptosis may be the only manifestation of a nuclear CN&#160;III palsy (see Chapter&#160;7). <span class="italic">Cerebral ptosis,</span> which is a rare form of ptosis, occurs in association with a lesion of the cerebral (typically right) hemisphere. The ptosis may be bilateral or unilateral, and in the majority of cases, it is transient, lasting up to several months.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Suspicion of the presence of systemic disorders such as <span class="italic">myasthenia gravis, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, oculopharyngeal dystrophy,</span> and <span class="italic">myotonic dystrophy</span> (discussed in Chapter&#160;14) requires questions regarding the patient’s general strength, fatigability, dysphagia, and family history. <span class="italic">Botulism</span> leads to bilateral ptosis associated with poorly reactive pupils and ophthalmoplegia. Such patients also have associated facial paralysis and generalized proximal muscle weakness. Areflexia, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia characterize <span class="italic">Miller Fisher syndrome,</span> a variant of Guillain-&#173;Barré syndrome (discussed later in this chapter). In addition to bilateral ptosis, patients with Miller Fisher syndrome may also have facial diplegia, as well as respiratory and swallowing difficulties. Long-term use of steroid eyedrops is thought to lead to ptosis as a localized steroid-&#173;induced myopathy of the levator muscle. Posterior sub-&#173;Tenon steroid injections have also been associated with ptosis. The levator muscle, aponeurosis, or the insertion site of the aponeurosis may be adversely affected by such injections.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Levator aponeurotic defects</span> have been found to be the most frequent cause of acquired ptosis, supplanting the idea that acquired ptosis is the result of aging (“senile” ptosis). This ptosis is caused by stretching, dehiscence, or disinsertion of the levator aponeurosis. Aponeurotic ptosis may occur with frequent eye rubbing or prolonged contact lens use, and may also be caused or exacerbated by intraocular surgery, perhaps resulting from use of an eyelid speculum. Because the levator muscle itself is healthy, levator function is usually normal. Patients with aponeurotic defects usually have a high eyelid crease.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Traumatic</span> and <span class="italic">mechanical</span> causes of acquired ptosis are generally evident from inspection of the eyelids and require appropriate medical or surgical therapy.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Pseudoptosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pseudoptosis encompasses conditions that mimic true ptosis, such as brow ptosis and laxity and dermatochalasis. Pseudoptosis can also be caused by microphthalmos or by phthisis bulbi, conditions resulting in the eyelids being inadequately supported by the globe. Hypotropia also causes pseudoptosis, because the perception of eyelid position is related to the position of the eye (see Fig&#160;11-2). Contralateral eyelid retraction may also give rise to pseudoptosis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Apraxia of Eyelid Opening</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Apraxia of eyelid opening is a rare disorder that causes unilateral or bilateral ptosis (Video&#160;11-1). Thought to be supranuclear in origin, it is characterized by the inability to open the eyelids voluntarily, related to frontalis contraction and facial grimacing. It is often associated with extrapyramidal disease such as Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, Huntington disease, Wilson disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy. The disorder has also occurred after bilateral frontal lobe infarcts. Apraxia of eyelid opening may also occur in patients with benign essential blepharospasm.</p>

			<p class="h1">Eyelid Retraction</p>
				<div id="Chapt11_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyelid retraction is present if the sclera is visible above the superior corneal limbus when the eyes are in primary position. It is usually acquired but may be present at birth. Preterm infants occasionally have a benign transient conjugate downgaze associated with upper eyelid retraction. In many healthy infants (80% of children 14–18&#160;weeks of age), bilateral eyelid retraction (eye-&#173;popping reflex) occurs when ambient lighting levels are reduced.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">Table&#160;11-2</span> lists the causes of acquired eyelid retraction. In adults, the most common cause is thyroid eye disease (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-7</span>). The eyelid retraction <span class="italic">(Collier sign)</span> in <span class="italic">dorsal midbrain syndrome</span> (see Chapter&#160;8, Fig&#160;8-5) is a less common cause. Unilateral eyelid retraction can develop as a result of contralateral ptosis (pseudo–eyelid retraction); this phenomenon results from Hering’s law of equal innervation. Bilateral eyelid retraction can be associated with thyroid eye disease, familial periodic paralysis, Cushing syndrome, and midbrain disease, or hydrocephalus with vertical nystagmus. Unilateral eyelid retraction is caused chiefly by thyroid eye disease but may also occur from aberrant regeneration of CN&#160;III (see Chapter&#160;7), Marcus Gunn jaw-&#173;winking syndrome (see Fig&#160;11-6), idiopathic levator fibrosis, carcinomatous infiltration, or iatrogenic causes (strabismus surgery on the vertical rectus muscles or ptosis repair). Several surgical procedures have been used to reduce the degree of eyelid retraction in patients with thyroid eye disease. See BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System</span>, for a review of eyelid retraction treatment methods.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Abnormalities of Facial Movement</p>
				<div id="Chapt11_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ophthalmologist may be asked to evaluate CN&#160;VII weakness, which is frequently seen in clinical settings. Assessment of CN&#160;VII includes testing not only motor function, but also sensory and autonomic functions. Motor function can be readily assessed by observation. With the patient at rest, any asymmetry of facial expression or eyelid blink is noted. The palpebral fissure on the side of CN&#160;VII paresis will be wider as a result of the relaxed tone of the orbicularis oculi muscles. The clinician can test the various muscle groups by asking the patient to smile, to close the eyes forcibly, and to wrinkle the forehead. The degree to which the eyelashes become buried on each side can reveal subtle orbicularis oculi weakness. The corneal blink reflex provides a functional assessment of CN&#160;VII and CN&#160;V.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Testing autonomic functions such as salivation and lacrimation as well as testing sensation can help localize CN&#160;VII lesions. Cutaneous sensation can be tested along the posterior aspect of the external auditory canal. Lesions of CN&#160;VII from the cerebellopontine angle to the geniculate ganglion typically impair all functions of the nerve, whereas lesions distal to the geniculate ganglion affect only certain functions, depending on their location (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any aberrant facial movements at rest or during volitional movement should be noted (see Fig&#160;11-4). After any facial neuropathy, but most commonly as a result of Bell palsy, regenerating axons may reinnervate different muscles from those originally served; such aberrant regeneration can cause synkinetic movements. In this situation, the involved facial muscles may remain weak. When axons originally destined for the orbicularis oculi reinnervate the lower facial muscles, each blink may cause a twitch of the corner of the mouth or a dimpling of the chin. Conversely, movements of the lower face—such as pursing the lips, smiling, or chewing with the mouth closed—may produce involuntary eyelid closure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other disorders of aberrant facial innervation include lacrimation caused by chewing <span class="italic">(crocodile tears),</span> in which fibers originally supplying mandibular and sublingual glands reinnervate the lacrimal gland by way of the greater superficial petrosal nerve. This syndrome usually develops after severe injury to the proximal CN&#160;VII and may be accompanied by decreased reflex tearing and decreased ability to taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.</p>

				<div id="Chapt11_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Disorders of Underactivity of the Seventh Cranial Nerve</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Facial weakness or paralysis may occur with supranuclear, nuclear, or infranuclear lesions (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;11-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Supranuclear lesions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A frontal lesion in the facial portion of the precentral gyrus results in a contralateral paralysis of volitional facial movement, which involves the lower face more severely than the upper face (upper motor neuron lesion). Emotional and reflex facial movements such as smiling and spontaneous blinking are usually preserved because they are controlled through extrapyramidal pathways.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With extrapyramidal disorders, such as parkinsonism or progressive supranuclear palsy, spontaneous facial expression is minimal, and the spontaneous blink rate is usually reduced. Volitional facial movements generally remain intact.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Brainstem lesions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ipsilateral facial weakness that involves both the upper and lower face may occur with a pontine disorder. Vascular lesions and intraparenchymal tumors are the most common causes. Other evidence of a pontine disturbance is to be expected, such as ipsilateral corneal and facial anesthesia, CN&#160;VI palsy, lateral gaze palsy, cerebellar ataxia, and contralateral hemiparesis. Dissociations between the autonomic, sensory, and CN&#160;VII motor functions may be present. Large lesions of the pons may produce facial diplegia, which also occurs in Möbius syndrome, a congenital disorder involving bilateral CN&#160;VI palsies or gaze palsies.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Peripheral lesions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Peripheral or lower motor neuron lesions that result in ipsilateral facial weakness may have numerous causes. Concomitant impairment of CN&#160;V, CN&#160;VI, or CN&#160;VIII or cerebellar signs may indicate cerebellar pontine angle tumors.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Bell palsy,</span> which typically occurs in adults, represents the most common type of facial neuropathy, but it must remain a diagnosis of exclusion. Bell palsy is characterized by the sudden onset of facial paresis. Pain may either precede the palsy or occur concurrently. Patients with Bell Palsy may report facial numbness, although their cutaneous sensation is usually intact. These patients may also note decreased tearing, diminished taste, and dysacusis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the etiology of Bell palsy is unknown, it is believed to be caused by autoimmune or viral-&#173;induced inflammatory or ischemic injury with swelling of the peripheral nerve. The incidence of Bell palsy is higher in pregnant women and in patients with diabetes mellitus or a family history of Bell palsy. If the facial weakness progresses over a period of more than 3&#160;weeks, an alternative etiology should be considered (eg, a neoplastic process, inflammatory disorder such as sarcoidosis, or an infectious cause).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Approximately 85% of patients with Bell palsy experience a satisfactory recovery, although subtle signs of aberrant regeneration can be detected on examination. In these patients, recovery typically begins within 3&#160;weeks of onset of the deficit and is complete by 2–3&#160;months. In the remaining patients, recovery is incomplete, and significant synkinesis with co-&#173;contraction of a variety of facial muscles is common (see Fig&#160;11-5). Complete facial palsy at the time of presentation, impairment of lacrimation, dysacusis, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, and advanced age are all poor prognostic factors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat Bell palsy, and evidence from meta-&#173;analyses and randomized trials supports their efficacy. A 7–10-day course of oral corticosteroids is recommended for patients without systemic contraindications within the first 72&#160;hours. The addition of an antiviral medication (eg, acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir) is of unclear benefit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Neoplasms may involve CN&#160;VII in the cerebellopontine angle (eg, acoustic neuroma [<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-9</span>], meningioma), within the fallopian canal, or in the parotid gland. Such lesions may compress CN&#160;VII, resulting in facial synkinesis. Most of these lesions are best evaluated through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with intravenous contrast.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Various infectious agents can cause CN&#160;VII pathology. The nerve may be impaired from meningitis. Lyme disease, caused by the tick-borne spirochete <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi,</span> can cause unilateral or bilateral facial palsies. Classic manifestations include a characteristic rash, arthritis, and meningopolyneuritis (see Chapter&#160;14). The prognosis for CN&#160;VII palsy recovery following treatment of Lyme disease is excellent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Herpes zoster that involves CN&#160;VII is called <span class="italic">Ramsay Hunt syndrome.</span> It is diagnosed through the identification of vesicles along the posterior aspect of the external auditory canal, over the tympanic membrane, or on the pinna. Pain is often severe, and postherpetic neuralgia may result. The prognosis for recovery is less promising than for Bell palsy. An isolated CN&#160;VII palsy, as well as other isolated or multiple CN palsies, may be the first sign of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion. Infectious disorders such as otitis media may spread to involve CN&#160;VII.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CN&#160;VII is the most common CN involved in sarcoidosis (see Chapter&#160;14). The site of involvement is usually the parotid gland, which develops noncaseating granulomatous inflammation. CN&#160;VII involvement is frequently bilateral yet asymmetric.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Facial diplegia may occur in <span class="italic">Guillain-&#173;Barré syndrome,</span> especially in the variant <span class="italic">Miller Fisher syndrome,</span> when ophthalmoplegia and ataxia are also present. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals an elevated protein level with a normal cell count, and deep tendon reflexes are usually absent. A high percentage of patients with Miller Fisher syndrome have anti-&#173;GQ1b IgG antibodies in their serum. Recovery is generally complete, and the serologic test results improve with clinical improvement.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CN&#160;VII palsy may occur from head trauma. The <span class="italic">Battle sign</span> (ecchymosis over the mastoid area) may be present and is associated with fractures of the temporal bone. Congenital facial palsy is frequently related to birth trauma from use of forceps and tends to resolve.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In <span class="italic">Melkersson-&#173;Rosenthal syndrome,</span> recurrent unilateral or bilateral facial paralysis is accompanied by chronic facial swelling and lingua plicata (furrowing of the tongue). The etiology of this disorder, which usually begins in childhood or adolescence, is unknown. The facial swelling is frequently marked and may be bilateral, even when facial paresis is only unilateral.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Given the extensive differential diagnosis for CN&#160;VII weakness, etiologic considerations in specific clinical situations deserve emphasis. <span class="italic">Bilateral</span> CN&#160;VII palsies are most frequently due to sarcoidosis, basilar meningitis (bacterial, viral, spirochetal), or Guillain-&#173;Barré syndrome. <span class="italic">Recurrent unilateral</span> CN&#160;VII involvement is most commonly idiopathic but may be caused by diabetes mellitus, Lyme disease, or Melkersson-&#173;Rosenthal syndrome. <span class="italic">Progressive</span> CN&#160;VII palsy is highly suggestive of a neoplastic etiology, either from tumor invasion (eg, brainstem, cerebellopontine, or parotid gland) or diffuse infiltration (eg, meningeal carcinomatosis). Further, accompanying CN palsies will aid in topographic localization of the lesion.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Treatment options for seventh cranial nerve underactivity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In cases of orbicularis oculi involvement, treatment of corneal exposure may be necessary. Artificial tear preparations and lubricants are sufficient in mild cases. Taping the eyelid shut with lubricating ointment in the eye for sleep may be necessary. Moisture chambers have been used at night. Patients should be advised to avoid dusty and windy environments. Breakdown of corneal epithelium indicates the need for punctal plugs, tarsorrhaphy, or the injection of botulinum toxin to induce ptosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with CN&#160;VII palsy, it is crucial to determine the status of CN&#160;V. Loss of corneal sensation combined with CN&#160;VII palsy is a particularly difficult clinical problem. The risk of combined neurotrophic and neuroparalytic keratitis warrants an aggressive approach, possibly including early tarsorrhaphy or an eyelid weight implant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The simplest and most successful surgical treatment for corneal problems associated with chronic CN&#160;VII palsies is the implantation of gold or platinum eyelid weights, combined with horizontal eyelid tightening such as a lateral tarsal strip. To avoid the implantation of too small a weight, preoperative evaluation should include trials of various weights taped to the eyelid surface. The heaviest weight that can be lifted clear of the visual axis should be chosen. Later, if facial nerve function recovers, the weight can be removed.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Disorders of Overactivity of the Seventh Cranial Nerve</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Disorders of CN&#160;VII, its nucleus, or the pyramidal or extrapyramidal pathways may produce hyperexcitable states. Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB), hemifacial spasm, and facial myokymia are the 3&#160;most common disorders of overactivity (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;11-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Benign essential blepharospasm</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">BEB is a bilateral condition that consists of episodic contraction of the orbicularis oculi. Onset usually occurs between the ages of 40 and 60&#160;years. Initially, the spasms are mild and infrequent, but they may progress to the point that the patient’s daily activities are severely disrupted. In advanced cases, the patient’s eyelids cannot be pried open during an episode of spasm. Facial grimacing and other movements may be associated with the blepharospasm (<span class="italic">Meige syndrome</span>, <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-10</span>), and cogwheeling in the neck and extremities or other extrapyramidal signs may be noted. <span class="italic">Tardive dyskinesia</span> secondary to neuroleptic and antipsychotic drugs can produce spasms that involve the mouth. Extrapyramidal disorders such as parkinsonism, Huntington disease, and basal ganglia infarction may be accompanied by some degree of blepharospasm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the exact cause of BEB is unknown, increasing evidence acquired through functional neuroimaging suggests that it is caused by basal ganglia dysfunction. The clinician evaluating a patient with blepharospasm should exclude causes of reflex blepharospasm, in particular severe dry eye, intraocular inflammation, and meningeal irritation (usually associated with photophobia). Stress may exacerbate the condition. Neuroradiologic studies are generally unrevealing and rarely indicated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The efficacy of medical therapy for BEB is generally limited. Tinted lenses, such as those with an FL-41 tint, may improve blink frequency and light sensitivity. The treatment of choice is injection of botulinum toxin (onabotulinumtoxinA, incobotulinumtoxinA, abobotulinumtoxinA, or rimabotulinumtoxinB) into the orbicularis oculi muscle. Because the effect of the toxin is temporary, lasting only a few months, repeat injections are necessary. The efficacy of the drug relates to its ability to cause muscle weakness. Complications such as ptosis, local ecchymosis, ectropion, diplopia, lagophthalmos, and exposure keratopathy are usually mild and transient. Treatment typically consists of 4–8&#160;injection sites per periorbita. The central portion of the pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle should be avoided to minimize the chance of inducing ptosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment with surgical myectomy is reserved for patients who are refractory to botulinum toxin injection. Treatment failure can be seen in patients with pure blepharospasm but is more commonly seen in patients with blepharospasm associated with apraxia of eyelid opening. See BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> for a more extensive discussion on surgical myectomy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">BEB may cause psychological distress, with some patients withdrawing socially as the symptoms worsen. Thus, counseling may be as valuable as the medical and surgical management of this condition. The Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research Foundation (<span class="url">www.blepharospasm.org</span>) aids research efforts and provides education and support to blepharospasm patients.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Hemifacial spasm</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hemifacial spasm is characterized by unilateral episodic spasms that involve the facial musculature and typically last from a few seconds to minutes. The disorder frequently begins as intermittent twitching of the orbicularis oculi muscle but, over the course of several years, spreads to involve all the facial muscles on 1&#160;side (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-11</span>). Episodes may increase in frequency for weeks to months and then abate for months at a time. CN&#160;VII function is usually intact, although, over time, subtle ipsilateral facial weakness may develop. Unlike BEB, the spasms can occur during sleep.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The pathogenesis of hemifacial spasm is most commonly compression of the CN&#160;VII root exit zone by a dolichoectatic vessel. Abnormal firing in the motor nucleus or ephaptic transmission of nerve impulses causes innervation directed toward a particular muscle group to excite adjacent nerve fibers that are directed to another muscle group. Less commonly, tumors within the cerebellopontine angle, Bell palsy, previous injury to CN&#160;VII, or demyelination may lead to the spasms; therefore, MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain is typically performed to exclude a compressive lesion or other secondary causes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Botulinum toxin injection into the periocular and facial muscles has proved very effective and is the treatment of choice for hemifacial spasm in most patients. Reinjection is required, at typical intervals of 3–4&#160;months. Hemifacial spasm responds to lower doses of botulinum toxin than does blepharospasm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Carbamazepine, clonazepam, or baclofen may provide improvement in some patients. Suboccipital craniectomy with placement of a sponge between CN&#160;VII and the offending blood vessel <span class="italic">(microvascular decompression)</span> may be considered for advanced cases or younger patients. Surgical decompression may offer a cure but carries higher risks than alternative treatments.</p>

			<p class="h3">Spastic paretic facial contracture</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Spastic paretic facial contracture is a rare disorder characterized by unilateral facial contracture with associated facial weakness. Typically, it begins with myokymia of the orbicularis oculi muscle, which gradually spreads to most of the ipsilateral facial muscles. At the same time, tonic contracture of the affected muscles becomes evident. Over weeks to months, ipsilateral facial weakness develops, and voluntary facial movements of the affected side diminish. Spastic paretic facial contracture is a sign of pontine dysfunction in the region of the CN&#160;VII nucleus, often caused by a pontine neoplasm. Damage to the nucleus causes facial weakness, and involvement of supranuclear connections leads to facial spasticity.</p>
			<p class="h3">Facial myokymia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Facial myokymia is characterized by continuous unilateral fibrillary or undulating contraction of facial muscle bundles. Occasionally, these rippling movements begin within a portion of the orbicularis oculi and may spread to involve most of the facial muscles.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Facial myokymia typically signifies intramedullary disease of the pons involving the CN&#160;VII nucleus or fascicle. It is usually the result of a pontine glioma in children and multiple sclerosis in adults. In rare instances, myokymia occurs in patients with Guillain-&#173;Barré syndrome. Myokymia may be relieved with carbamazepine, phenytoin, or injection of botulinum toxin.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intermittent fluttering of the orbicularis oculi <span class="italic">(benign eyelid myokymia)</span> is relatively common. The phenomenon usually lasts for days or weeks. In rare cases, eyelid myokymia can last for months; these patients may benefit from an injection of botulinum toxin. Caffeine, stress, and sleep deprivation are common contributing factors.</p>
			<p class="reference-single--no-space-">Banik R, Miller NR. Chronic myokymia limited to the eyelid is a benign condition. <span class="italic">J&#160;Neuro&#173;ophthalmol.</span> 2004;24(4):290–292.</p>
			<p class="h3">Other conditions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In rare instances, focal cortical seizures are manifested by gross clonic movements involving only 1&#160;side of the face. The eyes deviate away from the side of the seizure focus during the episode; the patient’s ipsilateral hand may also have clonic movements. Frequently, <span class="italic">Todd paralysis,</span> a transient supranuclear facial paresis, follows the seizure, and the eyes may deviate toward the side of the prior seizure focus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Oral facial dyskinesias (eg, tardive dyskinesia) are usually observed after long-term use of major tranquilizers and may persist even after the drugs are stopped. <span class="italic">Habit spasm</span> such as facial tic or nervous twitch is relatively common, particularly in childhood, and is characterized by involuntary, repetitive, reproducible facial movements that can be promptly inhibited on command. These movements tend to disappear in time without treatment. Only in rare cases does Tourette syndrome present with facial twitching alone.</p>
