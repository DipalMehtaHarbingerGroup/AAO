			<p class="h1">Introduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Since the 1980s, the World Health Organ&#173;ization (WHO) has focused its efforts on common behavioral and neurologic disorders that cause substantial disability and challenges to individuals, families, and socie&#173;ties. The WHO approach is based on epidemiologic evidence and the assessment of disease burden using disability-&#173;adjusted life-&#173;years (DALYs). In 2010, the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) demonstrated that &#173;mental, neurological, and substance abuse disorders accounted for 10.4% of global DALYs, an increase of 41% since 1990. It is estimated that this figure &#173;will increase another 5% by the year 2030. Some of the disorders that contribute to this overall burden include schizo&#173;phre&#173;nia, epilepsy, dementias (in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, Alzheimer disease), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, stroke, and brain injury. The global economic consequences of &#173;these health issues are significant as well, with an estimated economic loss of $16.3 trillion between 2011 and 2030.</p>

			<p class="h1">Behavioral Disorders</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Behavioral disorders encompass a wide range of conditions in which the common &#173;factor is disordered functioning of thinking, be&#173;hav&#173;ior, and/or interpersonal relationships. In the absence of screening, only approximately 50% of persons with depression and other &#173;mental health conditions are ever diagnosed. Recent reports indicate that less than 5% of adults in primary care settings are ever formally screened for depression. &#173;Because electronic health rec&#173;ords are starting to include standardized screening tools, including questions targeting depression, this percentage may improve. The prevalence of &#173;these disorders is staggering: each year, 1&#160;in 5 adults &#173;will experience a &#173;mental health condition, and 75% of &#173;these conditions develop by the age of 24. The goal of the WHO’s &#173;Mental Health Gap Action Program is to raise awareness of the challenges related to &#173;mental health disorders and to facilitate solutions for the growing need for ser&#173;vices, particularly in resource-&#173;poor regions.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Behavioral Disorders Associated With Medical Conditions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Behavioral disorders are sometimes associated with other conditions, which can pres&#173;ent a challenge to clinicians in understanding their cause and determining the best course of treatment. Sometimes the disorder is caused by the medical condition itself, and sometimes the etiology is multifactorial. Potential &#173;causes include adverse effects from medi&#173;cation or stressors related to dealing with the medical condition such as the associated financial burden, limited access to appropriate care, or the lack of an adequate support network.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because almost any disease can result in behavioral changes in an individual, it is imperative for clinicians to look for indicators of under&#173;lying causal &#173;factors. For example, &#173;mental disorders that develop in patients &#173;later in life are more likely to be related to an under&#173;lying medical condition that would explain the delayed onset. In addition, more acute changes may be the result of a physiological change, such as a neurovascular event, an infection, an environmental exposure, an electrolyte imbalance, or a hormonal change. Fi&#173;nally, behavioral abnormalities associated with disorders of the motor system, such as gait and balance prob&#173;lems, speech irregularities, or unusual tics, suggest a pos&#173;si&#173;ble under&#173;lying neuropathology, warranting further investigation. Neurologic disease states that can cause behavioral changes include head trauma and post-&#173;concussion syndrome, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors, especially tumors involving the frontal lobe.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chronic disease states, such as disabling rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pulmonary illness, or cardiovascular disease, are associated with higher rates of depression in adults. Other illnesses associated with behavioral changes in patients include untreated thyroid dis&#173;orders, Lyme disease, hemochromatosis, and Wilson disease. Some diseases may pres&#173;ent with only minor mood changes, whereas &#173;others pres&#173;ent with major depression, hallucinations, and delusions. As noted, behavioral changes may be induced by medi&#173;cations, for example, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, ste&#173;roids, and chemotherapeutic agents, among &#173;others.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Schizo&#173;phre&#173;nia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">WHO lists schizo&#173;phre&#173;nia as one of the top 10 disorders contributing to the global burden of disease. Schizo&#173;phre&#173;nia usually begins when patients are young and continues to a greater or lesser extent throughout their lives. The prevalence is estimated at 1% of the global population.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The hallmarks of schizo&#173;phre&#173;nia include hallucinations, delusions, disor&#173;ga&#173;nized thinking, and “negative” symptoms such as emotional and cognitive blunting. Motor disturbances range from uncontrolled, aimless activity to catatonic stupor, in which the patient may be immobile, mute, and unresponsive, yet fully conscious. Also common are repetitive, purposeless mannerisms and an inability to complete goal-&#173;directed tasks. Patients with schizo&#173;phre&#173;nia may have other &#173;mental health conditions, such as major depression and anxiety disorders. Alternatively, manifestations of schizo&#173;phre&#173;nia can be confused with symptoms of depression or anxiety. The lifetime occurrence of substance abuse in individuals with this disorder is approximately 50%. Associated illnesses include <span class="italic">schizophreniform disorder,</span> in which schizophrenic manifestations occur for less than 6 months, and <span class="italic">brief psychotic dis&#173;</span><span class="italic">order,</span> which lasts less than 1 month. Patients with <span class="italic">schizoaffective disorder</span> have a significant mood disorder, such as depression, in addition to the psychotic manifestations.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Mood Disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mood disorders, also called affective disorders, represent a spectrum of &#173;mental health illnesses in which prolonged periods of sadness (depression) are on one end and signs of excessive elation (mania) are on the other end. Manifestations of both ends of the spectrum at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent times in an individual is termed bipolar disorder.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Major depression</span> manifests as significant depressive episodes without any manic symptoms, often referred to as unipolar depression; it is far more common than mania alone. The lifetime risk for a major depressive disorder is 9% for men and approximately 17% for &#173;women. In developed countries, the prevalence of this disorder is around 18%, whereas in underdeveloped nations, it is around 9%. Major depression may occur at any age, but it most commonly affects middle-&#173;aged persons. El&#173;derly individuals who live in health care facilities and individuals affected with a wide range of acute and chronic disease also appear to be at higher risk.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Major depression is a disabling condition that &#173;causes impairment of basic physical functions, as manifested by sleep disturbances, changes in appetite with associated weight loss or gain, diminished libido, and an inability to experience plea&#173;sure <span class="italic">(anhedonia).</span> Affective changes include pervasive and per&#173;sis&#173;tent low mood, slowed thought pro&#173;cesses, low self-&#173;esteem, and loss of interest or plea&#173;sure in normal activities. Social withdrawal and psychomotor retardation are observed, although agitation can also occur. Patients commonly report somatic symptoms such as fatigue and headache, as well as other nonspecific symptoms. The risk of suicide in the depressed patient is over 25 times that of the general population; &#173;factors associated with suicide risk include the degree or longevity of the disorder, male sex, the &#173;family history of psychiatric disorder, and the presence of comorbidity. Patients with <span class="italic">dysthymic disorder</span> have chronic, less severe depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for major depression.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Mania</span> is a period of abnormally and per&#173;sis&#173;tently elevated or irritable mood that is sufficiently severe to impair social or occupational functioning. Typical symptoms &#173;include euphoria or irritability, grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, increased speed of thought and speech (flight of ideas), and increased goal-&#173;directed activity. Formerly called manic depression, <span class="italic">bipolar disorder</span> is found in approximately 3% of &#173;people. It manifests in 2 forms. Bipolar I disorder describes any illness in which mania is pres&#173;ent, &#173;whether or not depression occurs. Bipolar II disorder refers to patients with major depressive episodes and at least one mild manic episode (hypomania). <span class="italic">Cyclothymic disorder</span> describes cyclical episodes of mania and mild depression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For the nonpsychiatric clinician, depression creates several prob&#173;lems. In some patients, mood change may not be apparent, and the illness may manifest in somatic symptoms, leading to time-&#173;consuming, expensive workups. Conversely, in patients known to be depressed, an organic disease may be overlooked as psychosomatic. Recommendations for psychotherapeutic intervention may be met with re&#173;sis&#173;tance, anger, or denial, disrupting the patient–&#173;physician relationship. Patients may have difficulty adhering to diagnostic and treatment regimens for medical disorders and surgical procedures. A screening study of older patients attending an ophthalmology clinic showed that 1&#160;in 5 patients suffered from depression. Visual impairment almost doubles the risk of depression. In a recent study, the prevalence of depression in patients with macular degeneration was as high as 39%. The American Acad&#173;emy of Ophthalmology’s Preferred Practice Pattern Guidelines recommend screening all macular degeneration patients and providing appropriate referrals for &#173;those suspected of having depression.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Somatization, Anxiety, and Stress-&#173;Related Disorders</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Somatic symptom and related disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of &#173;Mental Disorders,</span> Fifth Edition (DSM-5), has recategorized “somatoform disorders” as <span class="italic">somatic symptom and related disorders.</span> The term somatoform disorder is still recognized, however, by the WHO <span class="italic">International Classifica</span><span class="italic">tion </span><span class="italic">of Diseases,</span> 10th&#160;Revision (ICD-10). (In ICD-11, which is now in development and is scheduled for approval by January&#160;2022, this designation may be replaced with the term <span class="italic">bodily distress disorder</span>.) The term “somatization” is a more general description of the syndrome of symptoms that suggest physical illness or injury in the absence of objective findings or a known physiological mechanism. &#173;These symptoms may be result from anxiety, depression, or interpersonal conflicts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The syndrome is not uncommon; the prevalence in the general population is approximately 6%. Risk &#173;factors associated with somatization include female sex, lower socioeconomic or educational level, and ethnic minority status. Somatization is a known prob&#173;lem among outpatient clinics, emergency department visits, and admittances to hospitals &#173;because each case requires investigation to rule out under&#173;lying disease. However, the disorder has significant ramifications for the individual affected &#173;because it can cause impaired functioning and disability. The most common pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion includes pain (eg, headache, back pain), gastrointestinal complaints, cardiopulmonary symptoms, and vari&#173;ous neurological symptoms. The manifestation can involve any system; ophthalmologists should be aware of this syndrome &#173;because patients may pres&#173;ent with ophthalmic-&#173;related symptoms such as blurred or double vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Entities &#173;under the DSM-5 designation of somatic symptom and related disorders &#173;include conversion disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and factitious disorder.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Conversion disorder</span> <span class="h4-text_italic">Conversion disorder</span> is characterized by temporary and involuntary loss or alteration of physical functioning caused by psychosocial stress. Symptoms are typically neurologic and may include functional vision loss. Psychotherapy is the primary treatment. Diagnosis may be difficult &#173;because of the subjective nature of the symptoms.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Illness anxiety disorder</span> Formerly called hypochondriasis, <span class="h4-text_italic">illness anxiety disorder</span> is a preoccupation with the fear of having or developing a serious disease. Physical examination fails to support the patient’s belief, and reassurance by the examining physician often fails to allay the fear. A subcategory of this entity relevant to ophthalmologists is <span class="h4-text_italic">body dysmorphic disorder,</span> in which the patient believes that his or her body is deformed, even though &#173;there is no physical defect, or the patient has an exaggerated concern about a mild physical anomaly. Ophthalmologists performing reconstructive and cosmetic surgery should be aware of this disorder &#173;because surgical repair of the “defect” is rarely successful in the patient’s mind.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Factitious disorder and malingering</span> <span class="h4-text_italic">Factitious disorder</span> (previously known as Munchausen syndrome) is characterized by the willful production, feigning, or exaggeration of physical or psychological signs or symptoms in the absence of external &#173;causes. Treatment requires discovery of the true nature of the physical illness, a carefully planned confrontation, and psychotherapy. Prognosis for recovery is guarded. Self-&#173;inflicted chronic conjunctivitis, keratitis, and even scleritis are the usual ophthalmic pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions of factitious disease. Although related, <span class="h4-text_italic">malingering</span> is not classified as a &#173;mental illness &#173;because it involves the fabrication of symptoms for secondary personal gain (eg, money, drugs); malingering should be considered when symptoms and findings do not make sense. Ophthalmologists should be familiar with techniques for detecting malingerers &#173;because patients are occasionally encountered in practice settings. See BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="h4-text_italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for a description of some of &#173;these techniques.</p>
			<p class="h3">Generalized anxiety disorder</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anxiety disorders represent another group of diseases that can significantly interfere with normal functioning. <span class="italic">Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</span> is common, with a lifetime prevalence of 5%. GAD affects &#173;women twice as frequently as men. The disorder is characterized by unrealistic or excessive anxiety and worry that is not focused on one par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar life event. GAD is associated with depression in a majority of cases and carries an increased risk of substance abuse. Pharmacologic therapy and psychotherapy may be successful in treating patients with this disease.</p>
			<p class="h3">Panic disorder</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with <span class="italic">panic disorder</span> report discrete periods of intense terror and impending doom with associated physical symptoms (eg, trembling, difficulty breathing) that are almost intolerable. &#173;These episodes can occur abruptly, &#173;either in certain predictable situations or without any situational trigger. Mild cases may be treated with psychotherapy, but more significant disease may require treatment with antidepressant medi&#173;cation such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Post-&#173;traumatic stress disorder</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Post-&#173;traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</span> occurs &#173;after an individual has been exposed to a traumatic event associated with intense fear. When exposed to reminders of the event, the patient then per&#173;sis&#173;tently re-&#173;experiences the event through intrusive recollections, nightmares, flashbacks, or distress. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD is variable but has been reported at rates as high as 12% in the general population of North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca and significantly lower rates (approximately 1%) in other countries. This difference is poorly understood. Combat soldiers and victims of assault are at par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar risk. Treatment usually includes cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, and antidepressants.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Personality disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Personality disorders</span>, which affect approximately 6% of the global population, merit discussion &#173;here &#173;because they may be associated with substance abuse and poor adherence to treatment. &#173;These disorders are diagnosed when personality traits become so inflexible and maladaptive that they create significant occupational and/or interpersonal dysfunction. Patients usually have &#173;little or no insight into their disorder. DSM-5 categorizes &#173;these disorders into 3 types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Cluster A personality disorders</span> include paranoid, schizotypal, and schizoid disorders.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Cluster B personality disorders</span> include antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders. Patients with &#173;these disorders may display dramatic or irrational be&#173;hav&#173;ior and may have a tendency for disruptive be&#173;hav&#173;ior in clinical settings.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Cluster C personality disorders</span> include avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-&#173;compulsive personality disorders.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Psychotherapy is generally the treatment of choice for all of &#173;these entities. &#173;There are no medi&#173;cations indicated specifically for personality disorders, although psychotropic agents may be helpful in treating coexisting &#173;mental health disorders (eg, depression or substance abuse).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Substance Abuse Disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Drug dependence</span> is the abuse of a drug to the point that one’s physical health, psychological functioning, or ability to exist within the demands of society is threatened. Drug abuse and addiction are often considered strictly social prob&#173;lems. However, &#173;there is overwhelming evidence that in addition to the detrimental short-&#173;term effects, drug abuse has long-&#173;term effects on brain metabolism and activity. With habitual use, changes occur in the brain, turning drug abuse into an illness of addiction. Individuals who are addicted to drugs have compulsive drug cravings and are typically unable to quit by themselves; treatment is necessary to end the compulsive be&#173;hav&#173;ior.</p>

Pupillary constriction commonly occurs with the use of opiates, while dilation occurs with the use of cocaine, amphetamines, or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Pupillary dilation may also be observed in individuals undergoing opiate withdrawal.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">Sustained horizontal gaze-&#173;evoked nystagmus can be a sign of sedative or ethanol use. Toxic optic neuropathy is observed in patients with alcohol dependence as &#173;either a direct effect of the disease or in association with the malnutrition that often accompanies alcoholism. Wernicke disease, which is most often associated with chronic alcoholism, is caused by thiamine deficiency; individuals with Wernicke disease pres&#173;ent with ocular palsies, nystagmus, memory disturbance, and peripheral neuropathy. &#173;Children born to &#173;mothers with alcoholism may have fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Ocular manifestations of FAS include epicanthal folds, ptosis, strabismus, optic nerve hypoplasia, microphthalmia, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular anomalies. See BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="sidebar2-text_italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> for further discussion of FAS.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text--last-">Patients who abuse intravenous drugs are at risk of retinovascular occlusion and endophthalmitis and are more likely to have an HIV infection, which has associated ocular findings. Cocaine use can lead to optic neuropathy, intracranial microinfarcts causing internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and visual field defects. Its use during pregnancy can cause intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, developmental delay, and learning disabilities. Affected infants also have an increased risk of strabismus and neonatal retinal hemorrhages. Crack cocaine use in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar should be considered in young patients who pres&#173;ent with corneal ulcers or epithelial defects without an obvious cause.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Pharmacologic Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Antipsychotic Drugs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Antipsychotic drugs have been used for over 60&#160;years and are broadly divided into 2 groups: first-&#173;generation (“typical”) antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-&#173;generation (“aty&#173;pi&#173;cal”) antipsychotics (SGAs) (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;11-1</span>). The distinction between the 2 categories is based on differences in receptor activity, adverse effects, and overall efficacy, although &#173;there is overlap in both classes. Both are used in the treatment of schizo&#173;phre&#173;nia as well as in the management of bipolar disorder and other psychiatric conditions. FGAs are primarily dopamine receptor blockers, whereas SGAs inhibit both serotonin and dopamine. FGAs are more likely to cause extrapyramidal “Parkinson-&#173;like” side effects (including rigidity and tremor) and tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements of the face, tongue, trunk, and extremities).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Antipsychotic medi&#173;cations effectively reduce many symptoms of acute and chronic psychoses, allowing more patients to function outside psychiatric institutions. In addition to potential extrapyramidal reactions, other adverse effects include drowsiness, orthostatic hypotension, anticholinergic effects, and weight gain. Less common prob&#173;lems include cholestatic jaundice, blood dyscrasias, photosensitivity, and a rare idiosyncratic reaction known as <span class="italic">neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).</span> NMS is characterized by “lead-&#173;pipe” muscle rigidity and hyperthermia and can lead to rhabdomyolysis and pos&#173;si&#173;ble death if not recognized and treated. The SGAs may be less likely to cause &#173;these adverse effects, although higher doses may still cause prob&#173;lems.</p>

Anticholinergic effects may lead to secondary dry eye syndrome, accommodative symptoms, and the precipitation of angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. A few studies have suggested an increase in cataract formation in patients taking antipsychotic drugs, particularly first-&#173;generation antipsychotics (FGAs).

			<p class="h2">Antianxiety and Hypnotic Drugs</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Benzodiazepines</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The benzodiazepine class of medi&#173;cations is often the first-&#173;line therapy for patients with GAD. They are also beneficial as an adjunct to anesthesia or for management of alcohol withdrawal, treatment of seizures, alleviation of muscle spasm, treatment of insomnia, and treatment of nocturnal myoclonus. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;11-2</span> lists the common antianxiety and hypnotic medi&#173;cations as well as the older class of barbiturates. The use of barbiturate drugs has declined due to their high potential for addiction and abuse. Although effective in treating &#173;these disorders, benzodiazepine use has also diminished over concerns related to de&#173;pen&#173;dency. Benzodiazepines are often prescribed to patients to manage the acute stage of chronic anxiety to allow time for prescribed serotonin–&#173;norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which may be safer for prolonged use, to take effect.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The mechanism of action for benzodiazepines is centered around their effect on gamma-&#173;aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the central ner&#173;vous system. Although &#173; &#173;these agents are similar in their effects, there is variation in the time of onset, half-&#173;life, and how they are metabolized. Withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, tremors, psychosis, and even seizures, are more likely if intake is abruptly stopped &#173;after long-&#173;term use. All of the benzodiazepine drugs have the potential to cause retrograde amnesia, and respiratory depression is pos&#173;si&#173;ble, especially if combined with alcohol. Benzodiazepines are involved in overdose suicide attempts in about 5% of cases.</p>

Nevertheless, long-&#173;term administration of &#173;these agents can cause physical dependence. Ocular adverse effects can occur, although they tend to be dose-&#173;related and transient. Decreased accommodation, induced phorias, and nystagmus are sometimes associated with benzodiazepine use.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Antidepressants</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A growing number of patients with major depression are being managed with medi&#173;cation alone, despite reports that demonstrate the benefits of combining pharmacologic treatment with psychotherapy. Nevertheless, this group of drugs is effective in managing the symptoms associated with depression, improving the rate of recovery, reducing the risk of suicide, and aiding in social and occupational rehabilitation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, antidepressants can take up to 6 weeks to show significant effect; treatment is generally continued for up to 12 weeks, although long-&#173;term management may be needed in select cases. Antidepressants are associated with a 50%–60% response rate among patients with major depression in the primary care setting. &#173;These drugs can result in mood elevation, improved appetite, better sleep, and increased &#173;mental and physical activity.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;11-3</span> lists the vari&#173;ous classes of antidepressants. The first-&#173;generation tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are generally no longer prescribed as first-&#173;line treatment due to safety concerns (in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, overdose) and adverse effects. Second-&#173;generation options include SSRIs, SNRIs, aty&#173;pi&#173;cal antidepressants, and serotonin modulators. Of &#173;these, SSRIs are the most widely prescribed; they are very effective and tend to be better tolerated. Occasional adverse effects associated with SSRIs include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, insomnia, weight gain, dizziness, headache, and blurred vision (likely related to dry eye and, to a lesser extent, mydriasis). Rare cases of angle-&#173;closure glaucoma have been reported. SSRIs may also cause inhibition of platelet function, and some studies suggest a pos&#173;si&#173;ble increase in risk of bleeding, especially involving the upper gastrointestinal system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because major depression is now thought to affect 5% of &#173;children and adolescents, the use of SSRIs has steadily increased in this population as well. &#173;There have been some reports of antidepressants leading to increased suicidal ideation in a small percentage of &#173;children and adolescents. Close monitoring for abnormal be&#173;hav&#173;ior, agitation, and suicidal thoughts is advised, especially within the first 4 weeks &#173;after the individual begins antidepressant therapy.</p>
			<p class="h3">Mood stabilizers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mood stabilizers are a heterogeneous group of medi&#173;cations that do not clearly share a common mechanism of action. They are the drugs of choice for the treatment of bipolar disorder. <span class="italic">Lithium carbonate</span> was the first drug to be developed in this class and has been the most widely studied. Other mood stabilizers include the antiepileptic agents <span class="italic">valproic acid</span>, <span class="italic">carbamazepine</span>, and <span class="italic">lamotrigine.</span> Potential ocular adverse effects of lithium use include blurred vision, nystagmus (usually downbeat), and exophthalmos associated with lithium-&#173;induced changes in thyroid function.</p>

Patient education and reassurance may be required &#173;because the&#160;under&#173;lying &#173;mental disorder may mean that anticholinergic side effects, such as dry eye and accommodative changes, are more concerning to patients. Poor adherence to treatment is another common prob&#173;lem among patients with &#173;mental health issues. Malingering and functional vision loss require a high index of suspicion and special diagnostic skills on the part of the clinician. Some&#160;medi&#173;cations used to treat eye disease, including carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, brimonidine, and oral corticosteroids, may induce or exacerbate&#160;depression. Although β-&#173;blockers &#173;were thought to increase the risk of depression, recent studies suggest this correlation is not as strong as was previously believed.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Parkinson Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Parkinson disease (PD), also known as paralysis agitans, is a neurodegenerative condition that is characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Parkinson disease usually affects persons older than 50&#160;years, and its incidence rises dramatically &#173;after age 60. Early-&#173;onset PD (prior to age 50) is seen in less than 10% of cases; risk &#173;factors for early onset are still unclear. Worldwide, approximately 7.5 million &#173;people are affected with the disease; this number is estimated to rise to over 9 million by 2030. Many studies indicate a male predominance. The differential diagnosis for Parkinson disease includes other neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Etiology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The basal ganglia are a complex of deep gray-&#173;matter nuclei that includes the corpus striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. &#173;These structures regulate the initiation and control of movement. Patients with Parkinson disease have typically lost 80% or more of the dopamine-&#173;producing neurons in the substantia nigra. Depletion of dopamine in the complex nigrostriatal pathway produces an imbalance in inhibitory and excitatory neuronal signals, leading to the cardinal signs of Parkinson disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although most cases are sporadic, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;factors are implicated in the pathogenesis, especially in early-&#173;onset cases. At least 5 pos&#173;si&#173;ble causative genes have been identified, and the number of Parkinson-&#173;like disorders associated with specific ge&#173;ne&#173;tic defects is increasing. Many of &#173;these defects appear to be involved in cellular protein metabolism. Overall, Parkinson disease seems to have a multifactorial etiology that includes ge&#173;ne&#173;tic predisposition, environmental &#173;factors, and age-&#173;related changes in neuron metabolism.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Symptoms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The first symptom of Parkinson disease is usually tremor of a limb at rest. Other common symptoms include bradykinesia, rigidity, a shuffling gait, postural instability, and stooped posture. Persons with Parkinson disease often have reduced facial expressions and speak in a soft voice. The disease is associated with nonmotor features such as depression (in up to 50% of cases), dementia, personality changes, sexual difficulties, sleep disorders, and hallucinations.</p>
			<p class="h3">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There is currently no cure for Parkinson disease. Dopamine replacement, with medi&#173;cations such as <span class="italic">levodopa</span>, is the main treatment. Dopamine itself cannot be given &#173;because it does not cross the blood–&#173;brain barrier. Although levodopa helps at least three-&#173;fourths of patients with Parkinson disease, not all symptoms respond equally to the drug. Brady&#173;kinesia and rigidity respond best, whereas tremor may only be marginally reduced. Prob&#173;lems with balance and other symptoms may not be alleviated at all. Patients are often given levodopa combined with <span class="italic">carbidopa</span>. The combination of the 2 together delays the conversion of levodopa into dopamine &#173;until it reaches the brain, diminishing some of the adverse effects that often accompany levodopa therapy alone.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;After years of therapy, patients may experience a “wearing-&#173;off” effect that occurs about 4 hours &#173;after a dose of levodopa, when symptoms may return. Catechol <span class="italic">O</span>-&#173;methyltransferase inhibitors such as <span class="italic">entacapone</span> extend the duration of the levodopa effect and reduce the “off” time by inhibiting the methylation of levodopa and dopamine.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several additional therapies for Parkinson disease exist, and research is dedicated to finding more effective modalities. Dopamine agonists <span class="italic">(bromocriptine, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine,</span> and <span class="italic">apomorphine)</span> stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain and may delay the need for levodopa. The monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitors <span class="italic">selegiline, rasagiline, </span>and<span class="italic"> safinamide</span> may modestly improve symptoms of Parkinson disease. Based on information obtained from animal studies, the first 2 may also have neuroprotective properties and are therefore considered to be potential disease-&#173;modifying agents. The glucagon-&#173;like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drug <span class="italic">exenatide</span>, which is used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, has also demonstrated some potential neuroprotective effect and is currently being studied. Anticholinergic drugs such as <span class="italic">trihexyphenidyl</span> and <span class="italic">benztropine</span> have a short-&#173;lived effect controlling tremor and rigidity. However, only about half of patients respond to anticholinergics, and typical anticholinergic adverse effects can be problematic.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Amantadine</span>, an antiviral drug, may be used during the early stages of the disease, &#173;either alone or in combination with anticholinergics or levodopa. &#173;After several months, the effectiveness of amantadine wears off in one-&#173;third to one-&#173;half of patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Modern surgical treatments consist primarily of deep-&#173;brain stimulation and pallidotomy or thalamotomy. The dopamine deficiency in patients with Parkinson disease results in excitation of the globus pallidus, which in turn inhibits thalamic activity. Both surgical techniques serve to suppress this excessive globus pallidus activity. Deep-&#173;brain stimulation is initially safer than pallidotomy but requires intensive adjustments and lifelong maintenance, given the risk of hardware complications and infection. Pallidotomy carries the risk of complications such as stroke and hemorrhage, as well as the risk of irreversible adverse effects, and is seldom performed.</p>

Eyelid disorders include seborrheic dermatitis and blepharitis, apraxia of eyelid opening, eyelid retraction, decreased blinking (with secondary dry eye), and blepharospasm. Ocular motor abnormalities include convergence insufficiency, limitation of upgaze, saccadic abnormalities, square-&#173;wave jerks, and oculogyric crisis.

			<p class="sidebar2-text--last-">Drug-&#173;related adverse effects may also be superimposed, especially for patients on anticholinergic medi&#173;cations, which may exacerbate dry eyes and cause accommodative changes or precipitate angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. Over 30% of patients with coexisting ocular disease and reduced vision may experience formed recurrent hallucinations characteristic of Charles Bonnet syndrome. However, this syndrome is not specific to Parkinson disease &#173;because it can be&#160;seen with other neurodegenerative conditions. Likewise, visual hallucinations can also occur as a result of treatment. This adverse effect has been reported in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar with the use of levodopa and anticholinergic agents. The drug amantadine has been reported to cause corneal infiltrates and edema in rare cases.</p>

			<p class="h2">Epilepsy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures due to a genet&#173;ically inherited or acquired brain disorder. The prevalence of epilepsy increases with age, especially &#173;after 65, and occurs in 2%–5% of adults in general. Even patients with epilepsy &#173;under relative control can experience prob&#173;lems with depression, driving, employment, and insurance.</p>
			<p class="h3">Etiology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epilepsy has many pos&#173;si&#173;ble &#173;causes. Seizures result from synchronized electrical activity of neuronal networks in the ce&#173;re&#173;bral cortex. Any disturbance of normal neuronal activity, including injury, infection, and abnormal brain development, can lead to seizures. Ce&#173;re&#173;bral vascular disease is the most common cause in older adults; however, about half of all seizures have no identifiable cause. Seizures may develop &#173;because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of neurotransmitters, or some combination of &#173;these &#173;factors. Epilepsy can also be associated with a variety of developmental and metabolic disorders, including ce&#173;re&#173;bral palsy, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Typically, seizures are divided into 2 major categories: partial and generalized. <span class="italic">Partial seizures</span> occur in only 1 part of the brain and are further divided into <span class="italic">&#173;simple</span> (without impairment of consciousness) and <span class="italic">complex</span> (with impairment of consciousness). Symptoms of &#173;simple partial seizures (also called <span class="italic">auras</span>) depend on the part of the brain from which the seizures originate and include motor symptoms, sensory symptoms (which can resemble a migraine aura), and even autonomic symptoms. Complex partial seizures are the most common type of seizures in adults with epilepsy. During the seizure, patients may appear to be awake but do not interact with &#173;others around them and do not respond normally to instructions or questions. They often stare into space and &#173;either remain &#173;motionless or engage in repetitive be&#173;hav&#173;iors, called <span class="italic">automatisms,</span> such as facial grimacing or gesturing.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Generalized seizures</span> cause impaired consciousness and abnormal activity in both hemi&#173;spheres at the onset of the seizure. &#173;These events may follow partial seizures. They can be nonconvulsive (absence, or “petit mal”) or convulsive (tonic–&#173;clonic, or “&#173;grand mal”; or some variation of tonic–&#173;clonic). Absence seizures almost always begin in childhood or adolescence and are frequently familial, suggesting a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic cause. During seizures, some patients make purposeless movements, such as jerking an arm or rapidly blinking their eyes. &#173;Others have no noticeable symptoms except for brief periods of “absence.” Childhood absence epilepsy often stops when the child reaches puberty. A generalized tonic–&#173;clonic seizure is the most dramatic, in that it begins with an abrupt alteration in consciousness, sometimes in association with a scream or shriek. All of the muscles stiffen, and the patient may become cyanotic during the tonic phase. Within a short time, the muscles begin to jerk and twitch for 1–2 minutes, and then the patient goes into a deep sleep.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The end of a seizure is referred to as the <span class="italic">postictal period</span> and signifies the recovery period for the brain. This period may last from several seconds up to a few days, though typically no more than a few hours. Postictal paresis (Todd paralysis) is a transient focal motor deficit that lasts for hours or, in rare cases, days &#173;after an epileptic convulsion. It is thought to be related &#173;either to neuronal exhaustion (from electrical overactivity during the seizure) or to active inhibition.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most common diagnostic test for epilepsy, although a normal EEG result does not rule out the disorder. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-&#173;photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are useful tools for revealing abnormalities in the brain that cause epilepsy. Patients with epilepsy have a higher overall mortality rate that is about twice that of the general global population. Occurrence of other associated mood disorders, particularly depression, is also higher in &#173;these patients.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Currently available treatments help control seizure activity in 80% of patients with epilepsy. The medi&#173;cation used is determined by the type of epilepsy, comorbidities, age of the patient, and potential drug interactions. This latter concern specifically applies to the medi&#173;cation’s effect on patients who are concurrently being treated with warfarin or certain antibiotics, or who are taking oral contraceptives. For generalized tonic–&#173;clonic seizures, the first-&#173;line therapy includes <span class="italic">valproic acid</span>, <span class="italic">lamotrigine,</span> and <span class="italic">topiramate</span>. For partial seizures, <span class="italic">carbamazepine, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine,</span> or <span class="italic">ethosuximide</span> are often used (especially in &#173;children). To minimize side effects, monotherapy is the goal; however, use of a second agent is sometimes necessary to control breakout seizures. Adverse effects vary; they may include nausea, rash, anorexia, somnolence, dizziness, and confusion. The neurologic effects often become the dose-&#173;limiting &#173;factor. Some of &#173;these drugs used for the treatment of epilepsy can also promote hyperlipidemia, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Rare, but serious, drug reactions include Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).</p>
			<p class="body-text">When medi&#173;cations inadequately control seizure activity, surgery is a potential option. The most commonly performed procedure for epilepsy is removal of a seizure focus via lobectomy or lesionectomy<span class="italic">.</span> Other, less common surgical procedures for epilepsy include multiple subpial transections, corpus callosotomy, and hemi&#173;spherectomy. An implanted vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) device can be effective in helping to control seizures in &#173;children when medi&#173;cation alone is not sufficient.</p>

Horizontal or vertical gaze deviations are commonly associated with seizure activity. The gaze tends to be directed away from the side of the cortical seizure activity during the event and then &#173;toward the side of the prior activity &#173;after the seizure. Some patients experience conjugate, convergent, or monocular nystagmus during the clonic stage of a seizure. Clonic eyelid retraction has also been described in patients with absence or myoclonic seizures. It is unusual for patients with true seizures to shut their eyes during the episode, whereas patients who are feigning a seizure often keep their eyes closed.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text">Certain antiepileptic drugs have potential ocular side effects. Phenytoin can cause dose-&#173;related nystagmus, and maternal use of this medi&#173;cation is associated with fetal hydantoin syndrome, which includes hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, glaucoma, optic nerve hypoplasia, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal colobomas. Carbamazepine can cause blurred vision, diplopia, and nystagmus. Topiramate has been associated with acute angle-&#173;closure glaucoma, anterior chamber shallowing, acute myopia, and choroidal effusions, usually within the first 2 weeks of therapy. &#173;These effects may be an idiopathic response related to the presence of sulfa in topiramate. Treatment of the glaucoma includes cessation of the drug and use of cycloplegics and topical hypotensives.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text--last-">Vigabatrin, used in refractory seizure disorders, is associated with irreversible concentric visual field loss in up to 50% of patients that is often asymptomatic. Central vision can also be affected. A complete ophthalmic examination and visual field testing should be performed before starting therapy and repeated &#173;every 3 months. The onset and progression of vision loss from vigabatrin are unpredictable and irreversible.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Alzheimer Disease and Dementia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Dementia</span> is a disorder characterized by a decline in cognitive ability to a point of interfering with daily function. The diagnosis can be challenging due to its insidious onset; early symptoms may only be apparent to close &#173;family members. Globally, the prevalence of dementia in individuals aged 60 and over is between 5%–8%. Of the 50 million &#173;people affected worldwide, approximately 60% live in low-&#173; to middle-&#173;income regions. Several specific syndromes fall &#173;under the category of dementia, including Alzheimer disease, vascular (multi-&#173;infarct) dementia, and Lewy body dementia.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Alzheimer disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Alzheimer disease (AD)</span> is the most common cause of dementia in &#173;people older than 65&#160;years. Memory impairment is its cardinal feature, with language and behavioral deficits occurring over time. In addition to age, &#173;family history appears to be a risk &#173;factor, suggesting a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic link; the early-&#173;onset form of the disease seems to have the strongest ge&#173;ne&#173;tic tie. The pathologic hallmarks of AD are extraneuronal amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary degeneration. &#173;These 2 findings are associated with neuronal death and decreased levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. As the disease progresses, the basal forebrain and eventually the ce&#173;re&#173;bral cortex become involved.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnosis of AD is made clinically; serological testing and neuroimaging studies are used to rule out other &#173;causes. Epidemiological data from the Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean Community Concerted Action Epidemiology of Dementia Group (EURODEM) found that 70% of patients with dementia have AD. In 2015, the estimated global cost of the disease was $808 billion. Life expectancy in individuals with AD is shortened relative to the degree of impairment at the time of diagnosis. The disease pres&#173;ents significant challenges to &#173;family and care&#173;givers in dealing with a variety of related issues, including emotional lability, risk of wandering, and potential for injury. Resources are available to assist patients and their families with &#173;these &#173;matters, such as the Alzheimer’s Association (<a href="http://www.alz.org">www.&#173;alz.&#173;org</a>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">An aty&#173;pi&#173;cal pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of AD can result from neuropathological abnormalities concentrated in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar areas of the brain. For example, posterior cortical atrophy can lead to progressive cortical impairment and ocular manifestations from pathology that involves the visual pathways. As a result, many of &#173;these patients may pres&#173;ent early in the progression of their disease to an optometrist or ophthalmologist with a variety of visual symptoms and findings, including homonymous visual field defects.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil and the neuropeptide-&#173;modifying agent <span class="italic">memantine</span> are helpful, used either alone or in combination therapy, in treating patients with AD. Studies investigating the potential benefit of vitamin E supplementation continue to show mixed results.</p>
			<p class="h3">Vascular dementia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Vascular dementia</span> is the second most common form of dementia and accounts for 10%–20% of cases in North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca and Eu&#173;rope. The disease is associated with findings on neurologic examination consistent with prior strokes; neuroimaging studies typically show evidence of multiple infarcts. As in other vascular diseases, patients with hyper&#173;tension, diabetes mellitus, or abnormal lipid profiles are at increased risk. Although <span class="italic">donepezil</span> and <span class="italic">memantine</span> are sometimes used in treatment, their benefit appears to be limited. Management is usually directed at treating any comorbidities, including the behavioral symptoms that often accompany this disease.</p>
			<p class="h3">Lewy body dementia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Lewy body dementia (LBD)</span> is another common form of neurodegenerative dementia. The disease is characterized pathologically by the presence of eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions (Lewy bodies) in the deep cortical regions of the brain. &#173;There may be considerable clinical and pathologic overlap between LBD, AD, and Parkinson disease. Ophthalmologists should be aware of LBD, however, &#173;because patients with this syndrome often pres&#173;ent with complex (or formed) visual hallucinations. The Dementia with Lewy Body Consortium has recently revised the criteria used to diagnose the disorder, including interpretation of certain biomarkers and the significance of the presence of an REM sleep be&#173;hav&#173;ior disorder in the patient. &#173;There are no specific pharmacotherapy options for patients affected, although cholinesterase inhibiters have shown some benefit in select cases.</p>

Reduced contrast sensitivity, depth perception, and motion perception have been reported in cases of Alzheimer disease (AD). &#173;Because this disease is associated with an impaired cholinergic system, a reduced pupillary constriction response may be observed, which improves &#173;after treatment with the anticholinesterase agent donepezil.</p>
			<p class="sidebar2-text--last- ParaOverride-7">Unfortunately, &#173;there is currently no reliable test specific to the diagnosis of AD. Ocular motility disorders, especially saccadic latency, have been observed. &#173;Because the ret&#173;ina is an extension of the ner&#173;vous system, researchers are investigating ways to help detect neurodegenerative disease using optical coherence tomography (OCT); thinning of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) may be an associated finding.</p>

			<p class="h2">Prion-&#173;Associated Neurologic Disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prion diseases (also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies) are chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorders that can affect both &#173;humans and animals. Prions are pathogenic agents that are transmissible and consist of abnormal proteins. Known &#173;human forms include kuru, Creutzfeldt-&#173;Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-&#173;Str<span class="accent">ä</span>ussler-&#173;Scheinker (GSS) syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). Kuru, which was the first prion disease to be identified, in a tribe in Papua New Guinea, is thought to be transmitted through cannibalism practices. Most prion diseases have overlapping clinical features, including tremor, ataxia, involuntary movements, and dementia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CJD is the most commonly recognized form of prion disease. The worldwide incidence is about 1 case per million population. Males and females are equally affected, and the median age of onset is 60. An iatrogenic form can occur following vari&#173;ous surgical procedures, including corneal transplantation. Rapidly progressive &#173;mental deterioration, behavioral abnormalities, and myoclonus are characteristic of the disease. Ophthalmic disturbances are not uncommon and may include diplopia, supranuclear palsies, hallucinations, and vari&#173;ous visual field deficits. CJD is distinguished from more common &#173;causes of dementia by its rapid onset and progression as well as the presence of myoclonus and associated gait disturbances. Brain biopsy is the gold standard in diagnosing the disorder but is rarely necessary. MRI, EEG, and ce&#173;re&#173;bral spinal fluid (CSF) analy&#173;sis are generally sufficient to rule out other disease etiologies and help establish the diagnosis. The presence of the CSF protein 14-3-3 is highly specific for the disease itself, but the sensitivity of the test is lower, so the usefulness of the test is limited. &#173;There is no treatment for CJD, and death often occurs within a year of onset.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Informed Consent in Patients with Behavioral and Neurologic Disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Every physician-&#173;patient interaction involves some assessment to determine &#173;whether patients have adequate capacity to make an informed decision about their own care. Assessing decision-&#173;making capacity in patients with &#173;mental health disease or specific neurologic conditions can pres&#173;ent challenges to the clinician caring for &#173;these patients. A patient’s cognition is the main determinant affecting this capacity; patients with impairment from any under&#173;lying cause, including behavioral and neurodegenerative disorders, are therefore at risk of impaired cognitive ability. At highest risk of such impairment are patients affected by Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, schizo&#173;phre&#173;nia, depression, substance abuse, and traumatic brain injury.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When cognitive impairment is suspected, the clinician should consider initiating a formal assessment of capacity by a trained professional. This assessment consists of open-&#173;ended questions that relate to the medical decision being investigated. The questions are designed to formally evaluate the 4 decision-&#173;making attributes: understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expression of a choice. Several assessment tools are available to help in testing for decision-&#173;making capacity, such as the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-&#173;T), the Assessment of Capacity for Everyday Decision-&#173;Making (ACED), and the Capacity to Consent to Treatment Instrument (CCTI). It is imperative for clinicians to understand the potential challenges; if patients refuse to be tested, it may be an issue of trust, particularly if the patients feel that their abilities to understand are being questioned. It may be effective to assist such patients in their understanding that this assessment is required, and that all information obtained during this assessment &#173;will result in the best medical care.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When it is determined that a patient has significant impairment and lacks the capacity to make an informed decision, &#173;there is an ethical obligation to find an individual who is capable of making decisions for that patient. It is helpful when patient preferences are established prior to the patient’s incapacity. Without this, local laws can determine who may serve as the patient’s proxy; generally, the order prioritizes the spouse first, followed by any adult &#173;children, then parents, siblings, or other relatives. If the treatment dilemma is urgent and no surrogate is found, formal guardianship can be assigned by a judge based upon a &#173;legal determination of incompetence.</p>
