			<p class="h1">Introduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lungs can be affected by numerous pathologic pro&#173;cesses, including inflammation (allergic, infectious, autoimmune, toxic), vascular insults, fibrosis, carcinoma, and changes resulting from cardiac or musculoskeletal prob&#173;lems. The functional consequences of the pathology can be divided into <span class="italic">obstructive</span> ventilatory functions and <span class="italic">restrictive</span> ventilatory functions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Symptoms of lung disease include dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. <span class="italic">Dyspnea</span> develops when the demand for gas exchange exceeds the capacity of the respiratory system, as in hypoxemia or hypercapnia. Dyspnea may also reflect the increased work of breathing, as occurs in cases of airway obstruction or reduced compliance of the lungs or chest. <span class="italic">Cough</span> develops when mucus, inflammatory debris, or irritants stimulate the bronchi, causing reflex clearing expectoration, or when the lung parenchyma is infiltrated with fluid, cells, or fibrosis. <span class="italic">Wheezing</span> occurs when bronchospasm narrows the large airways and exhaled air is forced through narrowed passages.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Obstructive Lung Diseases</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In patients with obstructive lung disease, changes in the bronchi, bronchioles, and lung parenchyma can cause airway obstruction. Obstructive lung diseases can be categorized as reversible or irreversible, although many cases may have some degree of both reversible and irreversible obstruction.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Reversible obstructive diseases</span> are grouped &#173;under the term <span class="italic">asthma.</span> In patients with asthma, the airways are hyperresponsive and develop an inflammatory response with bronchospasm to vari&#173;ous stimuli; the specific cause and duration of the bronchospasm can vary. In some persons, allergic immunoglobulin E (IgE)–&#173;mediated reactions to defined antigens cause bronchospasm. In many individuals with asthma, however, the cause of abnormal airway reactivity remains unknown. Precipitating &#173;factors may include exercise, aspirin, sulfites, tartrazine dye, emotional stress, cold air, environmental pollutants, or viral infection. Bronchial smooth muscle constriction, mucosal edema, excess mucus accumulation, and epithelial cell shedding all contribute to airway obstruction. This obstruction may be reversible, &#173;either spontaneously or with treatment. One marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation is an increase in exhaled nitric oxide; identifying this increase may be impor&#173;tant in mea&#173;sur&#173;ing an individual’s responsiveness to therapeutic intervention. Mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is approved for use in cases of severe eosinophilic asthma.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Irreversible obstructive disease</span> (sometimes known as <span class="italic">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]</span>) comprises a group of conditions in which forced expiratory flow is reduced in &#173;either a constant or a slowly progressive manner over months or years. COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), an international consortium working to improve prevention and treatment of COPD, publishes a guide on the diagnosis, classification, and management of this condition. The guide, which is updated regularly, can be downloaded from the GOLD website (<a href="http://www.goldcopd.org">www.&#173;goldcopd.&#173;org</a>). GOLD offers a framework for the management of COPD. Some conditions, such as <span class="italic">cystic fibrosis</span> or <span class="italic">bronchiectasis,</span> which are &#173;either secondary to recurrent necrotizing bacterial infections or which occur as part of Kartagener syndrome, have an identifiable cause. However, most irreversible obstructive diseases, such as <span class="italic">emphysema, chronic bronchitis,</span> and <span class="italic">peripheral airway disease,</span> cannot be ascribed to specific conditions; rather, they represent an individual response to cigarette smoking and vari&#173;ous airborne pollutants. For example, such responses occur in patients with &#173;either <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">1</span>-&#173;antitrypsin deficiency (associated with certain forms of emphysema) or airway hyperactivity and mucus hypersecretion (as in bronchitis). The pathologic consequences of the abnormal response result in specific damage to lung tissue. Emphysema is characterized by pathologic enlargement of the terminal bronchiole air spaces and by destruction of the &#173;alveolar connective tissue septa. Bronchitis is characterized by hypertrophied mucous glands in the bronchi; in peripheral airway disease, only the small airways demonstrate fibrosis, inflammation, and tortuosity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has similar pathophysiologic pro&#173;cesses to COPD: compromised gas exchange that leads to hypoxia and hypercapnia. OSA is a breathing dis&#173;order characterized by the narrowing of the upper airway, which impairs normal ventilation during sleep. This physical disruption of the upper airway distinguishes OSA from central sleep apnea, which occurs as a result of the brain temporarily not transmitting signals to the muscles that control breathing, leading to insufficient ventilation and compromised gas exchange. The current prevalence of OSA in the United States is estimated at 14% for men and 5% for &#173;women. The prevalence of OSA is much higher in patients with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, refractory hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and polycystic ovary disease. The fragmented sleep experienced by individuals with untreated OSA can lead to many negative consequences, including daytime sleepiness, cognitive disfunction, and decreased quality of life. Untreated OSA is also associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, resistant hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, stroke, and metabolic dysregulation that affects glucose control. In order for OSA to be diagnosed and evaluated, a patient must undergo polysomnography, a type of sleep study that rec&#173;ords the many biophysical changes that occur during sleep, including respiratory functions. Treatment of OSA has been shown to improve the individual’s quality of life, decrease motor vehicle collisions, and reduce the chronic health consequences associated with untreated OSA.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Restrictive Lung Diseases</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The restrictive lung diseases encompass a diverse group of conditions that cause diffuse parenchymal damage. The physiologic consequences of this damage include a reduction in total lung volume, diffusion capacity, and vital capacity. Occasionally, patients without parenchymal involvement who have diseases of the chest wall, respiratory muscles, pleura, or spine may have similarly restricted lung volumes. A <span class="italic">fibrotic</span> parenchymal response can result from occupational exposure to vari&#173;ous substances, including asbestos, silica dust, graphite, talc, coal, and tungsten. A <span class="italic">granulomatous</span> hypersensitivity reaction can develop in response to moldy hay, grains, birds, humidifiers, and cooling systems. Endogenous pulmonary disease can result from collagen vascular diseases, sarcoidosis, eosinophilic granuloma, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis), Goodpasture syndrome, alveolar proteinosis, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and other idiopathic parenchymal diseases. Therapeutic agents such as phenytoin, penicillin, gold, methotrexate, and radiation can also cause pulmonary disease.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Evaluation</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although all patients with respiratory prob&#173;lems should be &#173;under the care of a capable internist or pulmonologist, ophthalmologists and other physicians should be aware of the key components in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with pulmonary diseases. The following should be considered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Symptoms:</span> Dyspnea, orthopnea, chronic cough, and chronic sputum production.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">History:</span> Occupational exposure to vari&#173;ous toxins and irritants, &#173;family history, cigarette use.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Signs:</span> Audible wheezing, cyanosis, fin&#173;ger clubbing, forced expiratory time greater than 4 seconds, increased anteroposterior dia&#173;meter of the chest.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Laboratory studies:</span> Elevated hematocrit level and hypoxia or hypercapnia on arterial blood gas mea&#173;sure&#173;ment.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Chest radiography:</span> Parenchymal disease, hyperinflation, diaphragmatic flattening, increased retrosternal lucency, and pleural abnormalities.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Computed tomography</span> of the chest: Can detect many abnormalities not seen on chest radiographs, such as small areas of adenopathy, pulmonary embolus, small nodules, infiltrative lung disease, and bronchiectasis.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Bronchoscopy, transbronchial biopsy,</span> and <span class="italic">bronchial lavage:</span> Used to obtain culture material, cytology material, and pathologic specimens for analy&#173;sis.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3"><span class="italic">Pulmonary function tests:</span> Mea&#173;sure the mechanical and gas exchange functions of the lungs. The <span class="italic">forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV</span><span class="italic_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span><span class="italic">)</span> represents the volume exhaled in the first second of exhalation; the <span class="italic">forced vital capacity (FVC)</span> represents the total volume that the patient can exhale. Both par&#173;ameters and their serial rate of decline in a patient are objective mea&#173;sures of lung function as well as predictors of comorbidity and mortality from lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. An FEV<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>/FVC ratio less than 70% of predicted reference values suggests obstructive disease; total lung capacity less than 70% of predicted values suggests restrictive disease.</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Treatment</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are 2 major goals in the treatment of pulmonary disease. The first goal is to favorably alter the natu&#173;ral history of the disease. The second is to improve the patient’s symptoms and functional status and minimize associated prob&#173;lems.</p>
			<p class="h2">Nonpharmacologic Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Smoking cessation is the single most efficacious and cost-&#173;effective intervention in reducing the risk of COPD and slowing its progression. Ophthalmologists should not under&#173;estimate the power of even a brief discussion with a patient about the impact of smoking and the beneficial effects of smoking cessation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Similarly, <span class="italic">avoiding precipitants</span> of airway obstruction is impor&#173;tant in ameliorating asthmatic conditions. In patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, use of supplemental oxygen to maintain an arterial oxygen pressure above 60&#160;mm Hg confers a modest reduction in pulmonary hypertension and improved survival rates. However, a patient receiving supplemental oxygen must be carefully monitored &#173;because such treatment may decrease the body’s respiratory drive to eliminate carbon dioxide, aggravating respiratory acidosis and possibly leading to carbon dioxide narcosis. <span class="italic">Breathing </span><span class="italic">exercises</span> and <span class="italic">postoperative chest physiotherapy</span> have demonstrable short-&#173;term effects in improving respiratory function.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Noninvasive pressure support ventilation can be used to deliver increased airway pressure. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) throughout the ventilation cycle improves alveolar oxygen exchange. In CPAP therapy, a tight, well-&#173;fitting mask is placed &#173;either over the patient’s mouth and nose or just over the nose. Noninvasive pressure support ventilation is recommended for patients with respiratory failure who are expected to quickly respond to medical therapy. Intubation and standard ventilation are preferred for patients who require total ventilatory support, &#173;because the mask may slip, and effective ventilation may cease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Currently, the most effective treatment for OSA is CPAP; the positive pressure acts as a pneumatic splint to maintain airway patency. Treatment of OSA with CPAP therapy has been shown to improve daytime sleepiness, health-&#173;related quality of life, and mood and attendance at work, as well as reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, refractory hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke. Despite &#173;these proven benefits, a recent meta-&#173;analysis found that CPAP therapy did not reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events (acute coronary events, stroke, or vascular death) or all-&#173;cause mortality. In addition, although &#173;there are now over 100 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent mask options to help optimize patient comfort and adherence to mask use, patient adherence to this treatment option is low due to discomfort; some patients still find the mask cumbersome to wear.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Pharmacologic Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pharmacologic approaches to pulmonary disease include medi&#173;cations that are specific for the par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar condition and medi&#173;cations that improve the patient’s symptoms and functional status. <span class="italic">Specific medi&#173;cations</span> directly alter the pathophysiologic mechanisms under&#173;lying pulmonary disease. Some examples include cyclophosphamide for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, corticosteroids for sarcoidosis, and plasmapheresis in combination with immunosuppressive drug therapy for Goodpasture syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Symptomatic medi&#173;cations</span> are designed to reduce the obstructive or restrictive components affecting the patient’s lung function. Medi&#173;cations used to treat symptomatic bronchospastic airway obstruction include bronchodilators and inhibitors of inflammation (<span class="xref-table">Fig 7-1</span>), as well as antibiotics for infection-&#173;precipitated airway closures.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Bronchodilators,</span> which include theophylline, <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-&#173;adrenergic agonists, and anticholinergics, act primarily by relaxing the tracheobronchial smooth muscle. <span class="greek--tx-">b</span><span class="italic">-&#173;Adrenergic agonists</span> activate bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in bronchodilation. The selective <span class="greek--tx-">b</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;adrenergics, which have greater bronchodilatory effect and less cardiostimulatory effect, are commonly used, often in metered-&#173;dose inhalers (they can also be administered orally or parenterally). &#173;These drugs have replaced the nonselective <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-&#173;adrenergic agents such as isoproterenol. The short-&#173;acting <span class="greek--tx-">b</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;agonists include fenoterol, salbutamol, and isoetharine. &#173;These drugs differ in time of onset of action and duration of action. For example, the onset of action of isoetharine is within 1–3 minutes, and its duration is 60–90 minutes. Common long-&#173;acting <span class="greek--tx-">b</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;agonists include formoterol and salmeterol. Salmeterol, a particularly long-&#173;acting <span class="greek--tx-">b</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;adrenergic, is helpful in maintenance treatment of asthma; it should not be used for acute exacerbations. Although epinephrine &#173;causes predominantly <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-&#173;adrenergic stimulation in the lungs, it also &#173;causes peripheral <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-&#173;adrenergic stimulation, resulting in vasoconstrictive hypertension and tachycardia. Epinephrine is most often administered subcutaneously to help control an acute asthma attack.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Anticholinergic agents</span> directly relax smooth muscle by competing for acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Atropine and similar agents have been replaced by poorly absorbing atropinic congeners such as ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide, and tiotropium bromide. &#173;These inhalation agents have few systemic and minimal cardiac effects. They have an additive bronchodilator effect when combined with submaximal doses of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-&#173;adrenergic agonists.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Inhibitors of inflammation</span> include corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors, mast-&#173;cell stabilizers (cromolyn), and immunosuppressive agents. <span class="italic">Corticosteroids</span> not only suppress inflammation of the bronchioles but also potentiate the bronchodilator response to <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-&#173;adrenergic receptors. Inhaled corticosteroids can be used for an extended period to reduce bronchial hyperreactivity; they are not used to manage acute attacks. Systemic corticosteroids are highly effective in managing acute episodes, but &#173;because of the potential adverse effects associated with their use, they should be used only when necessary for serious flare-&#173;ups. <span class="italic">Leukotriene inhibitors</span> suppress the effects of inflammatory mediators. They are especially useful for prophylaxis and long-&#173;term maintenance therapy in asthma. <span class="italic">Cromolyn</span> prevents the release of chemical mediators from mast cells in the presence of IgE antibody and the specific antigen. <span class="italic">Immunotherapy</span> has been shown to be helpful for asthma triggered by a defined antigen.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Asthma treatment should be tailored to disease severity. Medi&#173;cation doses should be adequate to control symptoms rapidly and should &#173;later be reduced to the minimal level required to maintain control. The goals of therapy should include prevention of symptoms, reduction in frequency and severity of exacerbations, maintenance of normal (or near-&#173;normal) pulmonary function, maintenance of normal activity levels, and minimization of medi&#173;cation adverse effects. Maintenance medi&#173;cations include inhaled corticosteroids, cromolyns, leukotriene inhibitors, long-&#173;acting <span class="greek--tx-">b</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;agonists, anticholinergic agents, and oral corticosteroids. Appropriately used supplemental oxygen increases survival among patients with chronic respiratory failure and has a beneficial effect on pulmonary arterial pressure, polycythemia, exercise capacity, lung mechanics, and &#173;mental state.</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Notes:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption-bullet-list-first">•&#9;The stepwise approach is meant to assist, not replace, the clinical decision-&#173;making required to meet individual patient needs.</p>
			<p class="figure-caption-bullet-list-mid">•&#9;If alternative treatment is used and response is inadequate, discontinue it and use the preferred treatment before stepping up.</p>
			<p class="figure-caption-bullet-list-mid">•&#9;Zileuton is a less desirable alternative due to limited studies as adjunctive therapy and the need to monitor liver function. Theophylline requires monitoring of serum concentration levels.</p>
			<p class="figure-caption-bullet-list-mid">•&#9;In step 6, before oral systemic corticosteroids are introduced, a trial of high-&#173;dose ICS <span class="symbol">+</span> LABA <span class="symbol">+</span> &#173;either LTRA, theophylline, or zileuton may be considered, although this approach has not been studied in clinical &#173;trials.</p>
			<p class="figure-caption-bullet-list-mid">•&#9;Steps 1, 2, and 3 preferred therapies are based on Evidence A; step 3 alternative therapy is based on Evidence A for LTRA, Evidence B for theophylline, and Evidence D for zileuton. Step 4 preferred therapy is based on Evidence B, and alternative therapy is based on Evidence B for LTRA and theophylline and Evidence D for zileuton. Step 5 preferred therapy is based on Evidence&#160;B. Step 6 preferred therapy is based on <span class="figure-caption-italic">Expert Panel Report 2: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma </span>(EPR—2 1997) and Evidence B for omalizumab.</p>
			<p class="figure-caption-bullet-list-mid">•&#9;Immunotherapy for steps 2–4 is based on Evidence B for house-&#173;dust mites, animal danders, and pollens; evidence is weak or lacking for molds and cockroaches. Evidence is strongest for immunotherapy with single allergens. The role of allergy in asthma is greater in &#173;children than in adults.</p>
			<p class="figure-caption-bullet-list-last">•&#9;Clinicians who administer immunotherapy or omalizumab should be prepared and equipped to identify and treat anaphylaxis that may occur.</p>
