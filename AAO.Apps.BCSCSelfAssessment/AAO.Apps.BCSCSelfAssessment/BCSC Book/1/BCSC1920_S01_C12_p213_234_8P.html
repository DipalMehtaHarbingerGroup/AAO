			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goal of preventive medicine is not only to reduce premature morbidity and mortality but also to preserve function and quality of life.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Screening techniques can be used for research and for practical disease prevention or treatment. Screening for nonresearch purposes is useful if the disease in question is</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">detectable with some mea&#173;sur&#173;able degree of reliability</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">treatable or preventable</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">significant &#173;because of its impact (prevalence or severity)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">progressive</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">generally asymptomatic (or has symptoms a patient might deny or might not recognize)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Screening techniques should not be applied to a certain population &#173;until the following concerns have been addressed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-3">sensitivity and specificity of the test</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">con&#173;ve&#173;nience and comfort of the test</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">cost of finding a prob&#173;lem</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-4">cost of not finding a prob&#173;lem</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The term <span class="italic">sensitivity</span> describes how often a test result is positive among persons with a&#160;target disease. <span class="italic">Specificity</span> mea&#173;sures the test’s ability to exclude truly negative results. <span class="italic">Relative risk</span> is the probability of a disease based on a specific finding divided by the probability of that disease in the absence of that specific finding. (See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span> in this volume for additional discussion of &#173;these terms.)</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cost</span> can and should be mea&#173;sured in both economic and &#173;human terms, including the cost of discomfort, losing function, or &#173;dying.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Screening can be done as a one-&#173;time venture or by the sequential application of screening tests. Initially, a more sensitive test is administered; when appropriate, it is followed by a more specific test (which is often more costly or difficult to use). When judging the predictive value of the screens for an individual patient, the physician should account for the patient’s clinical history, current medi&#173;cations, and results from a physical examination.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Cardiovascular Diseases</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Hypertension</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines published in November&#160;2017 define hypertension as systolic blood pressure that is greater than or equal to 130&#160;mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 80&#160;mm Hg. Hypertension currently afflicts approximately 1.4 billion &#173;people worldwide. In the United States, it affects an estimated 103 million persons aged 20&#160;years and older; only about half of &#173;these cases are &#173;under control with treatment. In adults in the United States, the prevalence of hypertension is approximately 46% &#173;under the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. Hypertension in &#173;children is also becoming a more widely recognized prob&#173;lem.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The consequences of uncontrolled hypertension include significantly increased risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic stroke, atherosclerotic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, aortic aneurysm and dissection, &#173;peripheral arterial disease, and renal failure. Approximately 30% of end-&#173;stage renal disease is related to hypertension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hypertension meets all 5 of the screening criteria mentioned previously: it is detectable, treatable, highly prevalent, progressively damaging, and characteristically asymptomatic &#173;until late in its course. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;3</span> in this volume for discussion of the classification, evaluation, and pharmacologic treatment of hypertension.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the United States, atherosclerosis is responsible for approximately one-&#173;half of deaths in individuals of all ages and for one-&#173;third of deaths in individuals between 35 and 65&#160;years of age. Three-&#173;fourths of deaths related to atherosclerosis result from <span class="italic">coronary heart disease (CHD).</span> Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of permanent disability and accounts for more hospital days than any other illness.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The rationale for early screening emerged &#173;after it was demonstrated that a reduction in risk &#173;factors correlated to a reduction in the incidence of coronary disease events. For further discussion on identifying and modifying cardiovascular risk &#173;factors, see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4 in </span><span class="xref-local">this volume</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Screening for significant coronary artery atherosclerosis is more expensive and time-&#173;consuming than screening for associated reversible risk &#173;factors. In general, it is reasonable to screen for a history of cardiovascular symptoms and events (eg, chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, arrhythmias, claudication, stroke) and reserve more specific testing (eg, exercise stress testing, cardiac computed tomography [CT], or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for individuals in higher-&#173;risk categories.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cancer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In &#173;women, the most common cancers are breast, lung, and colorectal. In men, they are prostate, lung, and colorectal. The types of cancer that best meet the criteria for screening are breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and urologic cancer. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;12-1</span> pres&#173;ents the American Cancer Society’s 2017 recommendations for early cancer detection.

			<p class="h3">Breast cancer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Though now surpassed by lung cancer as the most common cause of death in &#173;women older than 40&#160;years, breast cancer remains the most common malignancy in &#173;women. The overall prevalence of breast cancer in the United States is 10%–12%. The age-&#173;adjusted incidence of breast cancer declined by 6.7% in 2003 (12% decline in &#173;women older than 50&#160;years). This decrease was mostly due to a 50% reduction in the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In the &#173;Women’s Health Initiative, a US National Institutes of Health randomized trial, HRT with estrogen and progesterone was associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer and abnormal mammograms. From 1989 to 2015, the breast cancer death rate in the United States decreased by 39%, although black &#173;women had a significantly higher death rate than white &#173;women. More than 75% of all breast cancers are cured with current therapy. Nevertheless, approximately 266,000 new cases of breast cancer and more than 41,000 related deaths &#173;were projected for the United States alone for 2018.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The importance of specific screening is increased by the presence of known risk &#173;factors, all of which are identifiable by patient history: (1) first-&#173;degree relative with breast, ovarian, or tubal cancer, (2) prior breast, ovarian, or tubal cancer, (3) nulliparity, (4) first pregnancy &#173;after age 30, (5) early menarche or late menopause, (6) radiotherapy to the chest between the ages 10 and 30, and (7) <span class="italic">BRCA</span> mutation status. Additional risk &#173;factors are high breast density, elevated serum estrogen or testosterone levels, a high-&#173;fat diet, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Approximately 42% of breast cancers detectable by mammography are not detectable by physical examination alone, and one-&#173;third of &#173;those found during mammographic screening are noninvasive or, if invasive, less than 1&#160;cm in size. &#173;Because mammograms can yield false-&#173;negative results, the best detection strategy involves a physical examination plus mammography, followed by fine-&#173;needle aspiration or biopsy if &#173;either reveals an abnormality. Mammography has been shown to be safe as well as effective; the current low-&#173;dose radiation associated with it does not significantly increase the risk of radiation-&#173;induced cancer. False-&#173;positive results may lead to overtreatment; in the Canadian &#173;National Breast Screening study, the incidence of over-&#173;diagnosis was 22%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Counseling alone is generally recommended for &#173;women with an average risk of breast cancer &#173;until 40&#160;years of age. According to the recommendation by the US Preventive Ser&#173;vices Task Force, mammographic screening should be performed &#173;every 2&#160;years for average-&#173;risk &#173;women aged 50–75&#160;years, and screening should be discussed with &#173;women from age 40. The American Cancer Society continues to recommend yearly mammography &#173;after age 45. In addition to general screening recommendations, assessment tools can help estimate an individual patient’s risk of breast cancer, for example, the Gail model (<a href="http://www.mdcalc.com/gail-model-breast-cancer-risk">www.&#173;mdcalc.&#173;com/&#173;gail-&#173;model-&#173;breast-&#173;cancer-&#173;risk</a>). Although the ideal mammographic screening interval is not clear, the American Cancer Society and US Preventive Ser&#173;vices Task Force recommendations, as well as results from large studies done in the United Kingdom and Eu&#173;rope (eg, EUROSCREEN), continue to support the life-&#173;saving value of mammography.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other modalities available for breast cancer screening include ultrasonography, digital mammography, and MRI. &#173;Because MRI of the breast is more sensitive but less specific than other methods, it should be used primarily in high-&#173;risk younger patients. &#173;Women with known mutations in the breast cancer 1 gene <span class="italic">(BRCA1)</span> or <span class="italic">BRCA2</span> gene are at dramatically increased lifetime risk for breast and ovarian cancer and require more intensive counseling and surveillance, including yearly mammography and breast MRI.</p>

			<p class="h3">Cervical cancer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cervical cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in patients between 15 and 34&#160;years of age. Overall, approximately 12,000 cases of invasive cancer of the cervix (about 4000 resulting in death) and 45,000 cases of carcinoma in situ occur each year in the United States. Worldwide, approximately 86% of the 450,000 cervical cancer cases diagnosed each year occur in developing countries. Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer, approximately half the &#173;women with the disease worldwide &#173;will die. In many developed countries (including the United States), mortality has been reduced by more than 50% due to the implementation of cytologic screening. Cervical cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States. The incidence of cervical cancer in the nations of the Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean Union (EU) varies widely; the highest incidence is in Romania and the lowest is in Finland. As of 2017, screening for cervical cancer is recommended in 22 EU countries.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The risk &#173;factors for cervical cancer include the presence of high-&#173;risk serotypes of HPV, the number of lifetime sexual partners, low socioeconomic status, positive smoking history, use of corticosteroid contraceptive hormones, and a history of other sexually transmitted infections. More than 99% of all cervical cancers are positive for HPV. Early detection and appropriate treatment markedly reduce the morbidity and mortality from invasive cancer of the cervix. Cervical cancer is asymptomatic when it occurs in situ, and the most effective screening technique remains the Papanicolaou test (“Pap smear”). HPV can be detected with polymerase chain reaction assay techniques, and patients aged 30–65&#160;years should consider receiving HPV testing at the time of their Papanicolaou test (“dual testing”). Vaccines to prevent HPV infection and its sequelae are discussed &#173;later in this chapter.</p>

			<p class="h3">Colorectal cancer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Colorectal cancer is a major killer in developed countries, second only to lung cancer in incidence and mortality. In the United States, the cumulative lifetime probability of developing colon cancer is roughly 4.5%, and approximately one-&#173;third of affected individuals &#173;will die from this disease. Although the overall incidence of colorectal cancer in the United States has been declining since 1980, &#173;there has been a steady increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer in individuals &#173;under the age of 50.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most authorities accept the theory that colorectal cancer develops from an initially benign polyp in a mitotic pro&#173;cess that occurs over approximately 10&#160;years. Colonoscopic removal or ablation of all polyps has become the standard of care where facilities and trained personnel are available. &#173;Factors associated with a higher risk of development of colon cancer include increased size and number of polyps, high-&#173;grade dysplasia or villous features on biomicroscopy, and sessile polyps only partially removed during a previous colonoscopy. Increased dietary fiber intake and reduced dietary fat intake have been associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer. Also, calcium supplementation, multivitamins containing folic acid, and the use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associated with a moderate reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is estimated that the mortality rate of colorectal cancer could be reduced by more than 50% with widespread adoption of screening studies, for example, the guaiac-&#173;based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy, with aggressive follow-up of patients with positive test results. Another stool-&#173;based screening test, fecal DNA testing, can detect molecular tumor markers associated with colorectal cancer. FIT and fecal DNA testing are easier to use and more sensitive than gFOBT, so patient adherence may be better.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Flexible sigmoidoscopy (&#173;every 5&#160;years) and home gFOBT (annually) have been recommended in asymptomatic adults between 50 and 75&#160;years of age. Recommendations remain controversial &#173;because of a lack of randomized &#173;trials. FIT, fecal DNA testing, and gFOBT are now accepted screening modalities by the American Cancer Society. Sigmoidoscopy offers good specificity but misses proximal cancers. Home gFOBT has been shown to decrease the mortality rate of colon cancer by up to 40%. For this test, 3 gFOBT cards are completed at home; a single gFOBT completed at the time of an annual physical examination is not sufficient.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Colonoscopy has been increasingly used as a screening test for asymptomatic patients older than 50&#160;years. When results are negative in low-&#173;risk patients, the test is repeated &#173;every 10&#160;years. Many of the lesions discovered with colonoscopy would not be detected with sigmoidoscopy. Yearly colonoscopy has been advocated in populations at very high risk, such as patients with familial polyposis and first-&#173;degree relatives of patients with colon cancer. The disadvantages of colonoscopy are its higher cost when compared with other screening methods, the number of trained personnel required to conduct the procedure, and the risks associated with intravenous sedation and of colonic perforation (approximately 0.2%). Colonoscopy’s advantage is its detection of suspicious polyps, which can then be removed, preventing progression to cancer.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CT colonography, another screening tool, may be able to screen out patients without neoplasia. Colonoscopy could then be reserved for only &#173;those patients with significant lesions. CT colonography may be preferable for &#173;those patients who are not healthy enough to undergo colonoscopy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For persons older than 50&#160;years, current American Cancer Society guidelines recommend a variety of screening tests, the exact method to be determined following discussion between the physician and the patient (see <span class="xref-local">&#173;Table&#160;12-1</span>). In 2012, the Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean Council recommended only gFOBT screening for individuals between the ages of 50 and 74&#160;years.</p>

			<p class="h3">Gastrointestinal cancer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Accounting for 80%–90% of cases, the primary risk &#173;factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus are tobacco use and alcohol consumption. The main risk &#173;factors for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus are gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obesity, and a history of Barrett esophagus (a complication resulting from long-&#173;standing GERD). Treatment for esophageal cancer has poor results; thus, prevention or elimination of the risk &#173;factors is worthwhile. The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is increasing in developed countries, but squamous cell carcinoma remains dominant in developing areas. Currently, no effective preventive screening programs are available, and most patients pres&#173;ent with advanced or metastatic disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Gastric cancer appears to be associated with certain geographic areas (Japan, China, Central and South Amer&#173;i&#173;ca, Eastern Eu&#173;rope, and parts of the &#173;Middle East), high ingestion of nitrates, loss of gastric acidity, lower socioeconomic status, and blood type A. It remains the second most frequent and lethal malignancy worldwide. Although routine endoscopic screening is not cost-&#173;effective, widespread screening for and treatment of <span class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</span> infection in high-&#173;incidence populations could be an effective strategy for reducing gastric cancer in &#173;these groups. Further testing is recommended only for individuals in high-&#173;risk groups.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pancreatic cancer is 2–3 times more common in heavy smokers than in nonsmokers, and it has also been associated with chronic pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Familial pancreatic cancer represents only about 5%–10% of all cases but carries a higher mortality rate than sporadic pancreatic cancer. Several ge&#173;ne&#173;tic mutations have been identified that are responsible for a small percentage of familial cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hepatocellular cancer is more common in persons with preexisting liver disease, especially cirrhosis and hepatitis B and C.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Lung cancer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-&#173;related deaths in men and &#173;women in the United States. Worldwide, &#173;there &#173;were 1.6 million deaths due to lung cancer in 2012. Among male patients with lung cancer in the United States, 85% are smokers. The number and percentage of cases in &#173;women have risen with the increased incidence of smoking in &#173;women. Fortunately, with the decreasing incidence of smoking, the incidence of and death rate from lung cancer in the United States have been declining. The usefulness of chest radiography and sputum cytologic screening in the general population is generally considered to be low. In high-&#173;risk patient groups, screening protocols effect a higher yield. In the US National Lung Screening Trial, lung cancer mortality in high-&#173;risk patients decreased when &#173;these patients &#173;were screened annually with low-&#173;dose helical chest CT. Positron emission tomography is a promising tool for identifying early malignant changes in the central airways; fluo&#173;rescent bronchoscopy may also be useful for this purpose. New molecular markers detected in sputum and serum show promise in the &#173;future of lung cancer screening. Prevention through smoking cessation remains the most effective way to decrease lung cancer mortality.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Melanoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, and its incidence is increasing faster than that of all other cancers. In the United States, about 1&#160;in 75 persons &#173;will develop melanoma during his or her lifetime. According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 91,270 new melanoma cases and 9320 related deaths &#173;were predicted in the United States in 2018.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most melanomas prob&#173;ably arise from dysplastic nevi. Risk &#173;factors for melanoma include history of melanoma or aty&#173;pi&#173;cal moles, presence of more than 50 moles, positive melanoma &#173;family history, history of previous nonmelanoma skin cancer, &#173;giant congenital nevus (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>20&#160;cm), xeroderma pigmentosum, treatment with UV-&#173;A and psoralens, frequent tanning with UV-&#173;A light, and a history of 3 or more severe (blistering) sunburns. Other, less significant risk &#173;factors are light complexion of the hair and eyes, freckles, inability to tan, indoor occupation with outdoor hobbies, and proximity to the equator.</p>
			<p class="body-text">UV damage prob&#173;ably &#173;causes most melanomas. Intense intermittent exposures are directly related to melanoma, whereas other skin cancers are more associated with cumulative exposure. UV radiation &#173;causes DNA damage, which is usually corrected by DNA repair enzymes; however, &#173;these DNA repair pro&#173;cesses degrade with increasing age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A pigmented lesion with any of the following characteristics, easily remembered by the <span class="italic">ABCDE</span> mnemonic, is suggestive of melanoma: <span class="italic">a</span>symmetrical lesions, <span class="italic">b</span>order (irregular), <span class="italic">c</span>olor (variable), <span class="italic">d</span>iameter (<span class="symbol">≥</span>6&#160;mm), and <span class="italic">e</span>volving (change in size, shape, or color). Other characteristics suggestive of melanoma are pruritus, bleeding, changing morphology, and new lesions or scalp lesions. Every&#173;one should perform periodic self–&#173;skin examinations; suspicious lesions require referral to a dermatologist and pos&#173;si&#173;ble biopsy. Avoiding the sun during peak hours and using sunblock can reduce the risk of melanoma and other skin cancers. In addition to providing &#173;simple visualization, when conducted by skilled examiners, dermoscopy (epiluminescence microscopy) can increase the specificity of clinical examination for the detection of melanomas.</p>

			<p class="h3">Urologic cancer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the United States, approximately 16% of new cancer cases per year are found in the prostate, bladder, kidney, and testes, with most of the common malignancies occurring in middle-&#173;aged and older men. Approximately 164,690 new cases of prostate cancer and nearly 29,430 related deaths are expected in 2018&#160;in the United States. Although prostate cancer can sometimes be detected early by digital rectal examination (DRE) of the prostate, no effect on mortality has been demonstrated, so annual DRE is no longer recommended. Serum prostate-&#173;specific antigen (PSA) screening remains controversial, and data suggest that this screening does not affect mortality. The PSA false-&#173;negative rate varies between 15% and 38%, and only about 30% of patients with elevated PSA levels truly have prostate carcinoma. A trend of increasing PSA levels is a more sensitive indicator of prostate cancer than is an individual elevated PSA level. &#173;Because of the high rate of false-&#173;negatives, minimal disease identified by PSA screening, and the potentially significant adverse effects of treating minimal disease, routine yearly serum PSA screening is no longer recommended except for higher-&#173;risk individuals, such as African &#173;American men and &#173;those with a positive &#173;family history of prostate cancer. Instead, in 2017, the US Preventive Ser&#173;vices Task Force recommended individualized discussion of the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening for men between the ages of 55 and 69; this guidance is similar to that given by the Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean Society for Medical Oncology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although prostate cancer is a potentially lethal illness, many detectable prostate cancers are of &#173;little threat to life. Some studies suggest that more than 75% of men with screen-&#173;detected localized disease may not even need treatment. Some men with low-&#173;grade prostate cancer receive curative treatment, even though their disease may not require treatment. More specific screening methods are needed to allow differentiation between potentially lethal and nonlethal cancers.</p>

			<p class="h2">Infectious Diseases</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The major public health screening efforts in the United States have been for tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections (syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, and herpes simplex virus). Hepatitis screening is used primarily for blood donation, institutionalized populations, and health care workers rather than for the general population. &#173;These disorders are discussed in more detail in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3">Tuberculosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">One-&#173;third of the world’s population is infected with <span class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB).</span> The prevalence of TB has recently increased in the United States, reversing de&#173;cades of steady decline. Thus, TB skin testing should be performed on individuals in high-&#173;risk groups, and positive results should prompt chest radiography and consideration of chemoprophylaxis. Some experts advocate regular skin testing of all persons younger than 35&#160;years at the time of routine health examination (for detection as well as for baseline data). The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends that all health care facilities conduct a TB risk assessment, with testing performed if indicated; routine testing is no longer recommended. In addition to TB skin testing, an interferon-&#173;gamma release assay (IGRA) can be used to screen for TB exposure. This blood test may be more specific in some clinical situations, including screening for TB in patients who previously received the BCG vaccine. Although acid-&#173;fast smears and histopathology remain the most common approach for confirming a diagnosis of TB, a number of nucleic acid amplification assays are also now available.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several candidate vaccines for TB are currently being investigated; they include subunit; recombinant BCG; and inactivated whole-&#173;cell vaccines. The current BCG vaccine can also provide limited protection to newborns in endemic areas.</p>

			<p class="h3">Syphilis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The incidence of syphilis is increasing in the United States, particularly among men who have sexual intercourse with other men. Syphilis is almost always transmitted sexually; congenital disease transmitted in utero still occurs but is rare (600 cases in the United States in 2016). The incidence of congenital syphilis has dropped 90% since the 1940s &#173;because of required premarital screening and pregnancy screening. Better prenatal care and increased syphilis screening during pregnancy improve the likelihood of detecting infants at risk for congenital syphilis, thus allowing early maternal treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Latent, untreated cases of syphilis in which the primary or secondary mucocutaneous lesion is no longer pres&#173;ent can be detected only by screening. It is impor&#173;tant to detect early latent disease: in approximately 25% of cases, infectious mucocutaneous lesions reemerge spontaneously in the first 2&#160;years. Late latent disease should be detected and treated &#173;because of the long-&#173;term destructive effects on the central ner&#173;vous system, the aorta, and the skeletal system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Screening is generally performed with the more sensitive, but less specific, nontreponemal antigen tests (VDRL, RPR, TRUST). Positive results are then confirmed with treponemal antigen tests (FTA-&#173;ABS, MHA-&#173;TP, TPPA, TP-&#173;EIA), which &#173;were more expensive in the past; automation of &#173;these treponemal antigen tests has decreased their costs, and &#173;these tests are now sometimes used for the initial screening.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Immunization</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The development of immunization as a means of preventing the spread of infectious disease began in 1796, when Edward Jenner injected cowpox virus, which &#173;causes a mild disease, into a child to prevent smallpox, a severe, potentially fatal illness. Immunization &#173;today still relies on Jenner’s inoculation methods to protect against disease. &#173;There are 2 types of immunization: active and passive.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In <span class="italic">active immunization,</span> the recipient develops an acquired immune response to inactivated or killed viruses, viral subtractions, bacterial toxoids or antigens, or synthetic vaccines. Once the immune response to a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar pathogen has developed, it protects the host against infection. The per&#173;sis&#173;tence of acquired immunity depends on the perpetuation of cell strains responsive to the target antigenic stimulus; for certain immunogens, booster inoculations may be required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, live, attenuated vaccines produce longer-&#173;lasting immunity; however, they are contraindicated in immunocompromised persons or pregnant &#173;women &#173;because the pathogen can potentially replicate in the host. Ideally, active immunization should be completed before exposure; however, life-&#173;saving postexposure immunity can be developed by combining active and passive immunization.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Passive immunization</span> depends on the transfer of immunoglobulin in serum from a host with active immunity to a susceptible host. Passive immunity does not result in active immunity and sometimes even blocks the development of active immunity. Passive immunity is short-&#173;lived and does not confer long-&#173;term immunity; however, it confers immediate protection on the recipient who has been exposed to the pathogen. Pooled &#173;human globulin, antitoxins, and &#173;human globulin with high antibody titers for specific diseases are the usual products available for passive immunization.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The current recommended US immunization schedules, developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices—&#173;including immunization schedules for persons aged 0–18&#160;years, the catch-up schedule for individuals aged 4 months to 18&#160;years, and the adult schedule—&#173;can be found on the CDC website (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html">www.&#173;cdc.&#173;gov/&#173;vaccines/&#173;schedules/&#173;index.&#173;html</a>). The catch-up protocols are for &#173;children who have missed some of the recommended immunization doses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Immunization should be avoided in persons who have allergic reactions to the vaccine or its components. Idiopathic autoantibody or cross-&#173;reacting antibody development may occur &#173;after vaccination, resulting in systemic disease such as Guillain-&#173;Barr<span class="accent">é</span> syndrome, a rare but devastating complication of vaccination. Immunization should be avoided during a febrile illness. Multidose immunization schedules that are interrupted can be resumed; however, doses given outside the schedule should not be counted &#173;toward completion of the vaccination sequence.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For patients who are pregnant, immunization against tetanus, diphtheria, and influenza is indicated; immunization against other diseases (hepatitis, pneumococcal or meningococcal disease) is indicated if a patient is at high risk of exposure. Additional immunizations may be considered but must be weighed against rare potential risks to the fetus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following sections are based on the more extensive recommended immunization schedules in the United States. In other parts of the world, immunizations are performed based on World Health Organ&#173;ization (WHO) guidelines, national programs, or recommendations by multinational organ&#173;izations such as the Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). As a general rule, national immunization schedules for &#173;children are quite similar, but recommended immunizations for adults vary widely between countries (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;12-2</span> lists a sampling).

			<p class="h2">Hepatitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are 3 main types of hepatitis viruses. Infection with <span class="italic">hepatitis A virus</span> (HAV) is the leading cause of viral hepatitis in the United States. HAV is usually transmitted orally and may be acquired from contaminated &#173;water supplies and unwashed or undercooked foods. Vaccination against HAV infection is recommended for &#173;children aged 12–23 months and for persons at high risk of exposure to HAV (eg, travelers to endemic areas, patients with blood clotting &#173;factor disorders, military personnel, drug abusers, &#173;family contacts of infected patients, laboratory workers exposed to the virus). In the United States, 2 preparations are available (Vaqta, Havrix), each consisting of viral antigens purified from &#173;human cell cultures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Approximately 250,000 cases of <span class="italic">hepatitis B</span> occur annually in the United States. Between 6% and 10% of adult patients with hepatitis B become carriers, and chronic active hepatitis occurs in 25% of &#173;these carriers. Of the patients with chronic active disease, 20% &#173;will die of cirrhosis and 5% &#173;will die of hepatocellular carcinoma. Worldwide, 250 million persons are chronic carriers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the United States, the available recombinant vaccines based on the hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen are Engerix-&#173;B and Recombivax HB. In adults, HBV vaccine is usually administered in a series of 3 doses, and 90% of recipients develop protective antibody levels (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>10 milli-&#173;international units/ml [mIU/mL]), which persist for at least 3&#160;years and may be protective for up to 30&#160;years. Booster injections are advised for persons whose antibody levels are less than 10 mIU/mL. A second vaccination results in the development of protective antibodies in 50% of the initial nonresponders.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vaccination before exposure to HBV is recommended and cost-&#173;effective for all infants and &#173;children and for individuals in certain high-&#173;risk groups: health care workers, hemodialysis patients, diabetic adults over age 60, residents and staff of long-&#173;term care facilities, &#173;house&#173;hold and sexual contacts of chronic carriers of HBV, hemophiliacs, users of illicit injectable drugs, prison inmates, sexually active homosexual men, and HIV-&#173;seropositive individuals. Vaccination can be combined with passive immunization for postexposure prophylaxis without affecting the development of active immunity. The incorporation of the vaccine into childhood immunization schedules has resulted in a decrease in the number of new hepatitis B cases reported annually, and &#173;there has also been a significant reduction in the number of hepatocellular carcinoma cases reported in &#173;children. Some of the available combination vaccines protect against not only hepatitis B, but also hepatitis A, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and polio.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be considered when &#173;there is perinatal exposure of an infant born to a carrier, accidental percutaneous or permucosal exposure to blood that is positive for the HBV surface antigen, or sexual exposure (within 14 days) to a carrier of HBV. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin should be given as soon as pos&#173;si&#173;ble &#173;after exposure; the recombinant HBV vaccine should be concurrently administered in an accelerated dosing schedule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with chronic hepatitis B infection and evidence of liver disease may improve &#173;after treatment with antiviral medi&#173;cations. If indicated, Interferon or nucleos(t)ide analogues (tenofovir or entecavir) are effective and have a lower incidence of viral re&#173;sis&#173;tance than lamivudine.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Hepatitis C</span> is the leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States. The CDC has recommended that all adults in the United States born between 1945 and 1965 have a one-&#173;time test for hepatitis C. Early intervention in chronically infected individuals, including treatment and alcohol counseling, can slow the progression of disease. Vaccines against hepatitis C and E are being developed. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span> for additional discussion of hepatitis C and other forms of the hepatitis virus.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Influenza</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although influenza is usually a self-&#173;limited disease with rare sequelae, it can be associated with severe morbidity and mortality in older persons or &#173;those with chronic diseases. Influenza vaccines produce long-&#173;lasting immunity. However, antigenic shifts, primarily in type A rather than type B influenza virus, require yearly reformulation of the vaccine to contain the antigens of strains considered most likely to cause disease. Protection is correlated with the development of antihemagglutinin and antineuraminidase antibodies, which decrease the patient’s susceptibility and the severity of the disease. The influenza vaccine is as effective in HIV-&#173;seropositive patients as it is in HIV-&#173;seronegative patients, regardless of the individual’s CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> T-&#173;cell counts. In the United States, annual vaccination is recommended for all adults and for &#173;children older than 6 months. The influenza vaccine is well tolerated, and &#173;there has been no increased risk of neurologic complications with the vaccines administered &#173;after 1991. Trivalent and quadrivalent <span class="italic">inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs)</span> are available, as well as a recombinant influenza vaccine. A live-&#173;attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is also available but may not be as effective as the IIV. Pregnant &#173;women may safely receive the IIV. Health care workers working with severely immunocompromised patients should receive the IIV. The IIV and LAIV should not be administered to persons with anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs, but the recombinant vaccine (Flublok) may be used. A high-&#173;dose vaccine for patients older than 65&#160;years is also available. Antiviral agents may be indicated to treat influenza in high-&#173;risk patients who are more likely to have serious sequelae from influenza (eg, el&#173;derly individuals, pregnant &#173;women, individuals with certain chronic conditions). The CDC (and &#173;others) suggest treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir) due to emerging re&#173;sis&#173;tance to amantadine and rimantadine.</p>

			<p class="h2">Varicella-&#173;Zoster</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Varivax, an approved live, attenuated varicella-&#173;zoster vaccine, is recommended in the United States for immunocompetent pediatric patients older than 12 months with no history of previous infection with varicella-&#173;zoster virus (VZV). A second dose is given when the child is between 4 and 6&#160;years of age. For patients older than 13&#160;years, 2 doses of vaccine are given 4–8 weeks apart. Health care workers who have not been exposed to chickenpox (varicella) should also be vaccinated. Varivax is safe and provides immunity for up to 20&#160;years. Data from the CDC confirmed a dramatic decline (87%) in the incidence of varicella in the United States from 1995 to 2000.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Shingrix, an inactivated recombinant zoster vaccine given in 2 doses, is recommended by the FDA for adults aged 50 or older to reduce the incidence of VZV infection. This vaccine, approved in 2017, decreases the risk of VZV by 90% and may be safe to use in immunocompromised patients. Zostavax, a live, attenuated vaccine, was previously recommended to reduce the risk of VZV infection and postherpetic neuralgia. However, Zostavax appears to be less effective than Shingrix, and Zostavax cannot be used in adults receiving high-&#173;level immunosuppressive therapy. Neither Zostavax nor Shingrix may be used in place of Varivax in younger persons. Also see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span>.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Measles</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vaccination has dramatically reduced the incidence of measles, along with its associated encephalitis and mortality. Introduced in 1963, the initial vaccine was based on an inactivated virus that did not provide a long duration of protection. In 1967, a live, attenuated vaccine providing long-&#173;lasting immunity was introduced. Vaccination with the attenuated strain should be routine not only for individuals aged 15 months but also for persons born between 1957 and 1967 who &#173;were neither vaccinated nor infected and for persons who received the inactivated viral vaccine. Individuals born before 1957 are considered immune by virtue of natu&#173;ral infection. The vaccine is contraindicated for persons with allergic or previous anaphylactic reactions to gelatin or neomycin but is safe for patients with hypersensitivity to eggs. Measles-&#173;mumps-&#173;rubella (MMR) vaccination is recommended for all &#173;children and is usually given first at about 15 months and again when the child is between the ages of 4 and 6, but the second dose can be given sooner if necessary. The preservative thimerosal is no longer used in this vaccine, and multiple studies have refuted previous concerns about an association between MMR vaccines and autism. For nonimmunized persons exposed to measles, postexposure prophylaxis with immunoglobulin should be given within 6 days of exposure.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Mumps</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The number of reported cases of mumps in the United States has decreased steadily since the introduction of a live mumps vaccine in 1967. Although mumps is generally self-&#173;limited, meningeal signs may appear in up to 15% of cases and orchitis in up to 20% of clinical cases in postpubertal males. Other pos&#173;si&#173;ble complications include permanent deafness and pancreatitis. Mumps vaccination is indicated for all &#173;children and susceptible adults, such as child care workers. Revaccination should be considered for patients who originally received only a single dose of the vaccine, particularly students entering college, health care workers, and individuals traveling to endemic areas. A third prophylactic dose reduced the incidence of outbreaks of clinical mumps on college campuses by 78%.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Rubella</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rubella immunization is intended to prevent fetal infection and consequent congenital rubella syndrome, which can occur in up to 80% of fetuses of &#173;mothers infected during the first trimester of pregnancy. The number of reported cases of rubella in the United States has decreased steadily from more than 56,000&#160;in 1969, the year the rubella vaccine was licensed, to 10 cases in 2005. Rubella was declared eliminated from the United States in 2004, and from the Amer&#173;i&#173;cas in 2010, although rare outbreaks still occur elsewhere in the world.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Rubella vaccine is recommended for adults, particularly &#173;women, &#173;unless proof of immunity is available (documented rubella vaccination on or &#173;after the first birthday or a positive serologic test result) or the vaccine is specifically contraindicated. A single subcutaneously administered dose of live, attenuated rubella vaccine provides long-&#173;term (prob&#173;ably lifetime) immunity in approximately 95% of persons vaccinated. &#173;Because of the theoretical risk to the fetus, &#173;women of childbearing age should receive the vaccine only if they are not pregnant.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Polio</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before the introduction of the first polio vaccine in 1955, polio (poliomyelitis) caused thousands of cases of paralysis. Despite widespread immunization with oral vaccine since 1962, polio persists in some nations in Asia and Africa. &#173;There are 2 forms of the vaccine: an oral form containing live, attenuated poliovirus (oral poliovirus vaccine [OPV], Sabin vaccine); and an injectable form containing killed virus (inactivated poliovirus vaccine [IPV], Salk vaccine), which is administered subcutaneously. To eliminate the risk of vaccine-&#173;associated paralytic poliomyelitis, a condition that has been associated more often with OPV than with IPV, only IPV is used in the United States. &#173;Because OPV is cheaper and easier to distribute and &#173;because it transmits the virus to unimmunized contacts of &#173;those who are vaccinated, helping the former develop immunity, the WHO suggests that OPV be used for immunization in developing countries. The currently used bivalent OPV is less likely to cause vaccine-&#173;associated polio than the older trivalent form. OPV is contraindicated in pregnant &#173;women or immunosuppressed patients, who should receive only the inactivated virus vaccine.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Tetanus and Diphtheria</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The combined tetanus and diphtheria toxoid vaccine (Td) is highly effective; it is used for both primary and booster immunization of adults. The pediatric vaccine, diphtheria-&#173;tetanus-&#173;pertussis (DTP), has been replaced with the newer pediatric vaccine, DTaP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoid with acellular pertussis). Tdap, which contains a lower concentration of diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis than does DTaP, is recommended in the United States as a one-&#173;time booster for all adults aged 19–64&#160;years, and particularly for all health care professionals and anyone caring for infants younger than 12 months. Young adults should also receive a booster dose of Td &#173;every 10&#160;years. If serious doubt exists about the completion of a primary series of immunizations, 2 doses of the combined toxoids should be given intramuscularly at monthly intervals, followed by a third dose 6–10 months &#173;later. Thereafter, a booster dose of 0.5&#160;mL should be given at 10-&#173;year intervals.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In wound management of tetanus, previously immunized persons with severe wounds should receive a booster if more than 5&#160;years has elapsed since the last injection. The management of previously unimmunized patients with severe wounds should include tetanus immunoglobulin as well as Td. Although tetanus is uncommon, more than 60% of cases occur in persons older than 60&#160;years. Therefore, older adults should be given a single booster at age 65. Pregnant &#173;women should receive one dose of Tdap during each pregnancy.</p>
			<p class="h2">Rotavirus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rotavirus, a double-&#173;stranded RNA virus, is the most common cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in &#173;children and infants worldwide. In the United States, 2 live-&#173;attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines are available: 1 based on a bovine rotavirus strain, and 1 an attenuated &#173;human rotavirus. Three oral doses of the bovine strain are given to infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age; alternately, 2 doses of the attenuated &#173;human vaccine are given at 2 and 4 months of age. The vaccine is not recommended in &#173;children with a history of intussusception or &#173;children receiving high-&#173;level immunosuppressive therapies.</p>

			<p class="h2">Pneumococcal Pneumonia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pneumococcal pneumonia is the most serious and prevalent of the community-&#173;acquired respiratory tract infections. Although pneumococcal disease affects &#173;children and adults, the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia increases in persons older than 40&#160;years. Since 1974, penicillin-&#173;resistant pneumococci have emerged. The mortality rate from bacteremic pneumococcal infection exceeds 25% despite treatment with antibiotics.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The current unconjugated pneumococcal vaccine contains polysaccharide antigens from the 23 serotypes of <span class="italic">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> most commonly found in bacteremic pneumococcal disease. The 23-&#173;valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) has been designed to induce a protective level of serum antibodies in immunocompetent adults and is highly effective in healthy young adults aged 19–64. Adults aged 65&#160;years and older may receive the PPSV23 &#173;either alone or in combination with PCV13 (see discussion in the following paragraph), particularly if they are in a high-&#173;risk group (eg, a history of cardiac or respiratory disease, sickle cell disease, splenic dysfunction, renal and hepatic disease, or immunodeficiency). &#173;Those who receive pneumococcal vaccine before age 65&#160;years should be revaccinated at age 65 if more than 5&#160;years has passed since the initial vaccination. PPSV23 is not effective for &#173;children &#173;under the age of 2.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is recommended in the United States for all &#173;children younger than 5&#160;years. In the United States, a 13-&#173;valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is typically used, while in Eu&#173;rope a 10-&#173;valent vaccine is more commonly used. PCV13 is administered in 4 intramuscular doses, given at 2, 4, 6, and 12–15 months of age. The vaccine provides coverage for approximately 80% of the invasive pneumococcal diseases in &#173;children in the United States. PCV is recommended for all infants and toddlers younger than 2&#160;years, all &#173;children between 2 and 5&#160;years of age who have chronic cardiopulmonary disorders or immune suppression, and some adults older than 65&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The duration of protection afforded by primary vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine seems to be 9&#160;years or more.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Haemophilus influenzae</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A vaccine against <span class="italic">Haemophilus influenzae</span> type b (Hib) is recommended for all &#173;children before age 24 months. The vaccine has significantly reduced the number of infections caused by encapsulated Hib. In the past, meningitis comprised approximately 60% of Hib infections, amounting to about 10,000 cases each year in the United States. The type b capsule enhances the invasive potential of <span class="italic">H influenzae;</span> thus, the presence or absence of serum antibodies to &#173;these capsular antigens is a critical &#173;factor that determines an individual’s susceptibility to systemic Hib infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The vaccine significantly reduces the risk of contracting Hib-&#173;related epiglottitis, meningitis, and orbital cellulitis. The vaccine is available as a conjugated protein between the capsular polysaccharide PRP and other agents that increase the immunologic response (PRP-&#173;OMP and PRP-&#173;T). It is also available in combination with other vaccines, such as DTaP or meningococcus (Hib-&#173;MenCY), for increased patient con&#173;ve&#173;nience and adherence. The vaccine is administered in 3 or 4 doses, with the first dose given at age 2 months and the final dose &#173;after age 12 months. When the full series is given, the vaccine is more than 95% effective.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Meningococcus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For the prevention of meningococcal meningitis, &#173;there are 3 meningococcal conjugate vaccines (Hib-&#173;MenCY, Men ACWY-&#173;D, and Men ACWY-&#173;CRM) and 1 unconjugated vaccine (MPSV4) available; &#173;these vaccines are recommended for use in all adolescents aged 11–18 as well as military personnel, college students living in dormitories, travelers to endemic areas (such as sub-&#173;Saharan Africa), close contacts of infected patients, new outbreaks, and high-&#173;risk patients (especially splenectomized and complement-&#173;deficient patients). The MenACWY vaccines are recommended for high-&#173;risk patients aged 2–10 or 19–55&#160;years. &#173;These vaccines are approximately 85% effective in preventing the spread of group C meningococcal infections, but they &#173;will not prevent infection from strains of meningococcus not represented in the vaccine. Immunity may wane over time, so revaccination may be required.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">&#173;Human Papillomavirus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The &#173;human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted virus that &#173;causes anal and genital warts (condylomata). More importantly, HPV is pres&#173;ent in 90% of all cervical cancers in &#173;women and is a leading cause of penile and anal cancer in men. It is hoped that preventing HPV infection &#173;will significantly reduce the incidence of cervical and other gynecologic cancers. HPV vaccines do not eradicate existing viral disease, so they are most effective if given before the patient becomes sexually active. The 9-&#173;valent HPV vaccine is given in a series of 3 doses over a 6-&#173;month period, beginning at age 11–12&#160;years in boys and girls. Catch-up doses can be given up to age 21&#160;years in men or age 26&#160;years in &#173;women or in men who have sexual intercourse with other men.</p>
			<p class="h2">Travel Immunizations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Precise travel vaccination recommendations depend on the geographic destinations, duration of travel, consumption of local food and untreated &#173;water, and likelihood of close contact with local populations. Health information for travelers, including updated immunization and prevention recommendations for vari&#173;ous regions of the world, can be found on the CDC website (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/travel">www.&#173;cdc.&#173;gov/&#173;travel</a>) and the WHO website (<a href="http://www.who.int/topics/travel/en">www.&#173;who.&#173;int/&#173;topics/&#173;travel/&#173;en</a>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Routine childhood vaccinations should be reviewed in all travelers and updated as needed. &#173;Children older than 6 months should be immunized against measles (MMR) prior to travel abroad. Yellow fever vaccination may be required for anyone &#173;going to or through a yellow fever endemic area or, to prevent introduction of the disease, for travelers returning from an endemic area. Immunization against hepatitis B should be considered in travelers who expect to have close contact with local populations known to have high rates of hepatitis B transmission. Emergency and relief workers should consider cholera vaccination. Meningococcus vaccination is required in order to obtain a visa to Saudi Arabia and is recommended for &#173;those planning to visit sub-&#173;Saharan Africa. Immunization for tick-&#173;borne encephalitis is available in Eu&#173;rope and Australia but not in the United States. Japa&#173;nese encephalitis vaccine should be offered to &#173;those whose travel plans include prolonged trips to rural areas in Southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent during the endemic season. Typhoid fever and hepatitis A immunizations are recommended for travelers who may be exposed to potentially contaminated food and &#173;water sources. Pre-&#173;exposure rabies vaccination should be considered for travelers whose plans include a prolonged visit in a remote area or for &#173;those whose activities might involve working near animals. See the WHO website for emergency treatment recommendations following a bite from a suspected rabid animal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Travelers planning to visit areas endemic for malaria should consult the CDC or WHO websites to determine appropriate chemoprophylaxis for the region. <span class="italic">Plasmodium falciparum</span> is almost always resistant to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, so &#173;these drugs are no longer recommended. The drugs used for malaria prevention include atovaquone/proguanil, hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline, mefloquine, and primaquine. All &#173;these medi&#173;cations may cause serious adverse effects.</p>

			<p class="h2">New and &#173;Future Vaccines</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">New vaccines are now available for typhoid fever <span class="italic">(Salmonella typhi),</span> anthrax, and rabies. Vaccines undergoing investigation include &#173;those for HIV, dysentery <span class="italic">(Shigella), Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile,</span> respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus, malaria, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex type 2, Epstein-&#173;Barr virus, TB, <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa, </span><span class="italic">Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus, Propionibacterium acnes</span> (now <span class="italic">Cutibacterium</span>), parainfluenza virus, and leishmaniasis. Some vaccines, such as &#173;those for smallpox and plague (Yersinia), are in development largely in anticipation of a &#173;future bioterrorism attack using &#173;these disease vectors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Passive immunization with &#173;human hyperimmunoglobulin is currently available to treat or prevent rabies, tetanus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, herpesvirus, and varicella-&#173;zoster infections. Respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin is no longer available, but new monoclonal antibodies show promise.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Considering the worldwide impact of infectious diseases, &#173;there is &#173;great interest in developing new vaccines for the treatment of gonorrhea, syphilis, leprosy, trachoma, and other infectious diseases. It is hoped that ongoing research &#173;will lead to the development of safe and effective vaccines for many or all of &#173;these illnesses.</p>
