			<div id="Chapt15_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although morbidity and mortality rates associated with ocular surgery are generally considered to be low, the perioperative management of ophthalmic surgery patients can be challenging. Often, &#173;these patients are older and have numerous medical conditions. In addition, the ophthalmic condition requiring surgery is sometimes directly related to an under&#173;lying systemic disease, such as diabetes mellitus or thyroid disease. Fi&#173;nally, for some delicate surgical procedures &#173;there may be specific requirements about the patient’s level of alertness during the operation, which in turn means that monitoring the level of sedation is particularly impor&#173;tant for &#173;those patients. This chapter discusses some of the key issues to consider in the preoperative medical assessment and intraoperative management of the ocular surgery patient.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Preoperative Assessment</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A complete history and physical examination are an essential part of the preoperative assessment of all patients. Determining a patient’s perioperative risk status involves identifying any high-&#173;risk conditions and symptoms that may necessitate additional testing as well as specific consultation and management prior to elective ophthalmic surgery. Perioperative risk determination may also influence the decision as to &#173;whether the surgery should be performed in an ambulatory surgical center (ASC) versus a hospital outpatient setting.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-&#173;PS) is a classification system that defines a patient’s overall health status prior to surgery; a higher ASA class (ASA III or higher) is associated with increased risk of complications, increased costs, unexpected hospital admission, and increased mortality, even &#173;after a low-&#173;risk surgery. Preoperative testing in a healthy patient or an asymptomatic stable patient, including electrocardiography and routine blood testing, is not necessary prior to ophthalmic surgery. Preoperative testing is performed only when indicated; that is, the tests would have been done even if surgery was not planned. Multiple clinical &#173;trials have failed to show a difference in perioperative adverse events in healthy patients undergoing elective eye surgery. The American Acad&#173;emy of Ophthalmology (AAO) advisory opinion on the responsibilities of the ophthalmologist, Appropriate Examination and Treatment Procedures, provides general guidance on determining the appropriateness and necessity of diagnostic procedures and perioperative treatment. Although ophthalmologists may delegate the acquisition of the data required for the preoperative history and the physical examination, the surgical planning and synthesis of information prior to surgery must be done by the operating ophthalmologist.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Avoiding surgical complications begins with the decision to operate. The risks and benefits of surgery, as well as any alternatives to it, are considered and the surgical plan is devised. Typically, the patient is involved in this pro&#173;cess; informed consent is contingent on the patient’s (or &#173;legal guardian’s) receipt of a detailed, understandable explanation of the surgical plan. Open communication between the surgeon and the patient enhances patient education and ensures realistic expectations regarding the anesthesia depth, surgical procedure, anticipated recovery, and expected outcomes. If a patient is judged to have some level of cognitive impairment, an assessment should be made to evaluate the capacity of the patient to understand the treatment options and thereby provide informed consent. &#173;There are multiple instruments available to assess cognitive capacity. If the patient’s level of cognitive impairment renders them unfit to provide consent, informed consent may be obtained from a &#173;legal proxy (power of attorney) designated to make treatment decisions for the patient (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span>&#160;in this volume for more on informed consent).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A careful review of medi&#173;cation allergies, reactions to previous anesthetics, or &#173;family &#173;history of a reaction to anesthesia is critical in identifying patients at risk for malignant hyperthermia (see the section Malignant Hyperthermia &#173;later in this chapter). For a patient with an implantable cardioverter-&#173;defibrillator, the ophthalmologist should discuss the status and pos&#173;si&#173;ble perioperative disabling of the device with the cardiologist before ocular surgery to avoid surgical complications, including pos&#173;si&#173;ble electromagnetic interference with the pacemaker.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The operating physician typically provides postoperative eye care. Any transfer of management should be discussed and approved, ideally before surgery, by the referring physician, the physician assuming &#173;future care, and the patient.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">&#173;Children and Adolescents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If surgery is planned on a child who is healthy and does not routinely take prescribed medi&#173;cations, no laboratory tests are necessary, even when general anesthesia is to be used. &#173;There is no evidence that abnormalities in a complete blood count affect the choice of anesthetic management for asymptomatic &#173;children. However, African American patients should be screened for sickle cell disease or trait if they have not previously been tested, &#173;because some aspects of anesthetic management &#173;will change in patients with hemoglobinopathy. Routine pregnancy testing of female patients of childbearing age, prior to anesthesia, is a complex issue that may become even more complex in minors, &#173;because individual states may have statutes concerning parental notification of test results. Consent for a pregnancy test is required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The decision &#173;whether to perform elective eye surgery in &#173;children with an upper respiratory tract infection requires judgment and should be made &#173;after careful consideration of the patient’s overall health status. A child who is already ill &#173;will likely feel even worse &#173;after surgery, and the significance of a postoperative fever may be difficult to interpret. However, in the absence of high fever or findings that suggest a lower respiratory tract infection, many anesthesiologists elect to proceed if the child appears well except for a runny nose.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Management of Medical Conditions Associated with Increased Perioperative Risk</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Cardiovascular Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Heart failure is one of the most common conditions requiring evaluation and treatment prior to noncardiac surgery. In stable asymptomatic patients undergoing low-&#173;risk surgery, preoperative assessment with electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, stress testing, chest radiographs, and cardiac catheterization is not necessary. Functional status is a reliable predictor of perioperative cardiac events; it can be assessed with a questionnaire such as the Duke Activity Status Index. If results from a recent stress test are not available, patients with good functional status are generally at low risk for a cardiac event in the perioperative period. However, if the patient shows clinical signs of decompensation, appropriate evaluation and management are indicated prior to surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Coronary heart disease is a risk &#173;factor for perioperative myo&#173;car&#173;dial ischemia, infarction, and death. However, even in patients with significant coronary heart disease, the risk of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) is still low in patients undergoing low-&#173;risk surgery such as ophthalmic surgery. The goal of perioperative management of &#173;these patients is to minimize the risk of ischemic complications developing. Patients who have under&#173;gone percutaneous coronary intervention require treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with aspirin and P2Y<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel) to prevent a recurrent occlusion of the stented artery. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>&#160;in this volume for further discussion of heart disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although hypertension is associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications, &#173;whether &#173;there is any benefit of lowering blood pressure (BP) in terms of risk reduction is unproven. Optimal blood pressure is also unclear, but the joint guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists of &#173;Great Britain &amp; Ireland and the British and Irish Hypertension Society recommend a target BP below 160&#160;mm Hg systolic and 100&#160;mm Hg diastolic prior to elective surgery. The guidelines allow for patients with unknown preoperative blood pressures to undergo surgery with BP lower than 180&#160;mm Hg systolic and lower than 110&#160;mm Hg diastolic. In general, if patients are asymptomatic and have taken their BP medi&#173;cations, and their documented BP has typically been &#173;under 160/100&#160;mm Hg prior to the day of surgery, then elective surgery may be performed regardless of the BP mea&#173;sure&#173;ment on the morning of surgery. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;3</span>&#160;in this volume for further discussion of hypertension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of death, heart failure, thromboembolic events, and hospital admissions. Patients with a history of stable atrial fibrillation do not require any preoperative specialized testing, but if the atrial fibrillation is newly onset, workup is recommended as well as delay of elective surgery. It is advisable to maintain medi&#173;cations for ventricular rate control, including their administration on the morning of surgery. If digoxin is used, obtaining preoperative blood levels is usually not necessary.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Diabetes Mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Management of blood glucose is impor&#173;tant in avoiding central ner&#173;vous system dysfunction. Although no single regimen works for all patients, in general, insulin-&#173;dependent patients should undergo surgery early in the day whenever pos&#173;si&#173;ble to minimize disruption of their metabolic status, and their glucose levels should be monitored postoperatively. For a diet-&#173;controlled diabetic patient undergoing a brief surgical procedure, management generally involves only monitoring of the blood glucose level immediately &#173;after surgery and &#173;every 3 hours &#173;until oral intake is resumed. It is imperative to provide close perioperative monitoring of glucose and electrolyte levels.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Respiratory Diseases</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pulmonary complications &#173;after surgery are a significant cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality. This is especially true in patients undergoing major intrathoracic and intra-&#173;abdominal surgery. Ophthalmic surgery is usually performed with the patient &#173;under local sedation, is of short duration relative to thoracic and abdominal surgery, and &#173;doesn’t result in pain for the patient, obviating the need for postoperative opioids that limit pulmonary risks. Intravenous sedation &#173;under monitored anesthesia care (MAC) during eye surgery can result in hypoventilation, hypercapnia, hypoxia, and atelectasis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is impor&#173;tant for the ophthalmic surgeon to ensure that the patient’s respiratory status is optimized preoperatively. If a &#173;patient’s history and physical examination identifies a potential comorbidity that could impact pulmonary function and increase risk of administering preoperative sedation, then obtaining a chest x-&#173;ray and/or pulmonary function tests would be of value. &#173;Medical optimization may involve increasing the patient’s inhaler regimen, administration of &#173;antibiotics (if infection is suspected), administration of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, and/or chest physiotherapy to manage secretions. Patients who are on long-&#173;term ste&#173;roid therapy should receive their usual dose on the day of the surgery; however, “stress-dose” glucocorticoid administration is generally unnecessary prior to ophthalmic surgery. Occasionally, general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway may be beneficial, for &#173;example, in patients with COPD who have severe dyspnea and cough in a supine position, are unable to lie still, or have high anxiety.</p>

			<div id="Chapt15_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Cardiac</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In general, patients taking cardiac or blood pressure medi&#173;cations should continue their current medical regimen, including on the morning of surgery, to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension and ischemia. However, diuretics may be held the morning of surgery and resumed when the patient begins taking oral fluids postoperatively. Digoxin, which has a long half-&#173;life, may also be withheld the morning of surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Guidelines for the use of prophylactic <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;blockers in the perioperative period have been revised following the publication of the POISE-&#173;II (Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation) trial study and a subsequent meta-&#173;analysis of clinical &#173;trials. &#173;These &#173;trials demonstrated that although perioperative administration of <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;blockers resulted in reduced incidence of acute myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction, the incidence of mortality and stroke increased within the first 30 days &#173;after surgery. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association as well as the Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean Society of Cardiology currently recommend that <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;blockers should be continued without interruption during the perioperative period in patients already taking them, but due to risk of harm, <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;blocker prophylaxis therapy should <span class="italic">not</span> be initiated on patients undergoing low-&#173;risk surgery (eg, ophthalmic surgery).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Anticoagulants/antiplatelet agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Whether to maintain or discontinue anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents in patients planning to undergo ocular surgery depends on the nature of surgery to be performed, the risk of ophthalmic bleeding, the potential effect of bleeding on postoperative outcome of proposed surgery, and the risk of a serious or fatal thrombotic event if the anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent is discontinued. In general, &#173;because cataract surgery is usually performed via a clear corneal approach using topical anesthesia, the potential benefit of stopping anticoagulants prior to surgery to prevent ophthalmic bleeding does not outweigh the potential risk. In a published meta-&#173;analysis of 11 clinical &#173;trials, when warfarin use was continued in patients undergoing cataract surgery, although &#173;there was an increased risk of ophthalmic bleeding, the bleeding events &#173;were minor and had no impact on vision. Similarly, continued use of aspirin or clopidogrel before cataract surgery did not result in an increased risk of ophthalmic bleeding events.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The success of other ocular surgeries, such as trabeculectomy or drainage implant surgery impact, could potentially be impacted by subconjunctival and scleral bleeding (although the bleeding is generally not life-&#173;threatening). Furthermore, patients with concomitant iris neovascularization are at high risk of developing postoperative hyphema. As a result, some surgeons prefer to stop therapy with antiplatelet agents, direct anticoagulants, and warfarin prior to filtering surgeries. In a study evaluating the risk of stroke, transient ce&#173;re&#173;bral ischemia, myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction, or deep venous thrombosis, no difference was demonstrated in the number of thrombotic events experienced by continuous users of aspirin or warfarin versus users who discontinued &#173;these agents prior to cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In theory, the same idea should apply to patients who discontinue use of direct anticoagulants before surgery. However, in patients who are on <span class="italic">dual antiplatelet therapy</span> (aspirin <span class="italic">plus</span> clopidogrel), for example, patients who have had a recent coronary event or placement of a cardiac stent, the risk of thrombosis of the stented artery leading to a potentially fatal outcome &#173;after withdrawal of &#173;these agents warrants a 1-&#173;year delay of the elective ocular surgery. Surgery may be performed sooner in patients undergoing cataract surgery in whom cessation of anticoagulants is unnecessary. If a year’s delay is not pos&#173;si&#173;ble, surgery should be deferred at least 30 days &#173;after bare-&#173;metal stenting and at least 6 months &#173;after a drug-&#173;eluting stent is inserted.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A recent study showed a 20% lower risk of intraocular bleeding with the direct-&#173;acting anticoagulants during eye surgery when compared to warfarin. In an urgent situation in which it is necessary to reverse the effect of the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, idarucizumab can reverse its effect within 15 minutes. At pres&#173;ent, however, the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved any reversal agents for direct &#173;factor Xa inhibitors (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>&#160;in this volume).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Diabetes Mellitus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Oral hypoglycemic medi&#173;cations are usually withheld the day of surgery. &#173;These medi&#173;cations have a relatively long duration of action, which could lead to hypoglycemia late in the day if the patient’s oral caloric intake is inadequate. For patients with relatively well-&#173;controlled insulin-&#173;requiring diabetes mellitus and reasonable glucose control (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>250&#160;mg/dL), one option is to hold all short-&#173;acting insulin and give a portion (one-&#173;third or one-&#173;half) of the usual dose of intermediate-&#173;acting or long-&#173;acting insulin the morning of the surgery.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Pulmonary Medi&#173;cations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Theophylline should be held the night before surgery due to potential risk of arrhythmia. If the patient is currently taking corticosteroids, the usual dose of ste&#173;roids is given on the morning of surgery, but stress-&#173;dose ste&#173;roids are usually unnecessary.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Perioperative Considerations</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top6">
			<p class="h2-h1">Preoperative Fasting</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The purpose of preoperative fasting is to reduce the amount of particulate &#173;matter in the stomach and to lower the gastric fluid volume and acidity in case aspiration of stomach contents occurs. Gastric emptying times vary depending on the type and quantity of food consumed. Clear liquids (eg, &#173;water, coffee, pulp-&#173;free juice, and carbohydrate drinks) empty fastest, breast milk empties &#173;after 4 hours, nonhuman milk by 6 hours, and large meals that include meat or fatty substances empty by 8 hours &#173;after consumption. Small meals, such as dry toast with black coffee and pulp-&#173;free juice, have been shown to clear within 4 hours.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Perioperative fasting protocols vary between institutions and between patients and may depend on comorbidities that influence gastric emptying and how urgently surgery is needed. For example, some institutions and anesthesiologists wait only 2 hours when performing surgery on babies fed breast milk. Patients with diabetes mellitus, particularly &#173;those with autonomic neuropathy, are at risk for gastroparesis (more than 50% of patients with long-&#173;term diabetes); therefore, &#173;these patients may have a prolonged gastric emptying time. Pregnant patients have a higher-&#173;than-&#173;normal risk of aspiration. Patients with known gastroesophageal reflux disease and &#173;those with peptic ulcer disease may also have an increased risk of aspiration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Note that a pediatric patient who fasts for 10–12 hours preoperatively may become hypotensive as a result of dehydration. The use of clear liquids orally up to 2 hours before surgery does not lead to a higher incidence of aspiration or other gastrointestinal complications in the setting of general or local anesthesia and is encouraged for the pediatric population.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Oral administration of an H<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span> blocker such as ranitidine or famotidine 2–4 hours &#173;before surgery reduces the percentage of patients with low gastric pH or high gastric &#173;volume. Metoclopramide promotes intestinal motility and decreases reflux, which may be especially useful in a nonfasting patient who requires urgent surgery, but it is associated with a higher risk for extrapyramidal adverse effects.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Latex Allergy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of latex allergy in the general population is 1%–6% and is 8%–12% among health care workers. Health care workers and hospital employees can experience progressive sensitization to latex &#173;because of repeated occupational exposure. This sensitivity is accentuated in &#173;those with a history of atopy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Certain medical populations are also at significant risk for this allergy, for example, patients with myelodysplasia or spina bifida and &#173;those who have under&#173;gone repeated urinary catheterization or frequent surgical procedures. A cross-&#173;reactivity with bananas, avocados, mangoes, and chestnuts has been demonstrated, and allergies to &#173;these foods and &#173;others have been associated with latex allergy. A history of reactivity to balloons also suggests a latex allergy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients suspected of having latex allergy should be clearly identified, and the operating room environment made latex &#173;free. Latex is an aeroallergen and can be pres&#173;ent in the operating room air for at least 1 hour &#173;after the use of latex gloves. Thus, whenever pos&#173;si&#173;ble, an allergic patient should be the first case of the day. Alternatively, surgery may be performed in a latex-&#173;free surgical fa&#173;cil&#173;i&#173;ty.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The definition of <span class="italic">wrong-&#173;site surgery</span> includes operating on the wrong site, performing the wrong procedure, or performing a procedure on the wrong person. In ophthalmology, the definition includes operating on the wrong eye or performing the wrong procedure, including implantation of a lens whose style and/or power differs from that chosen during preoperative surgical planning. For example, inserting a monofocal lens during cataract surgery, when the plan was to implant a premium intraocular lens, is considered the wrong procedure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In 2004, the Joint Commission enacted the Universal Protocol (<a href="http://www.jointcommission.org/standards_information/up.aspx">www.&#173;jointcommission.&#173;org/&#173;standards_&#173;information/&#173;up.&#173;aspx</a>), which was developed to eliminate wrong-&#173;site surgery in the United States.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">To reduce potential errors, including performing surgery on the wrong patient, 2 unique patient identifiers are required to be confirmed by the surgical team before the initiation of surgery. &#173;These identifiers, used during the time-&#173;out, include name, date of birth, and medical rec&#173;ord number. For the time-&#173;out to be effective, it is impor&#173;tant that members of the surgical team feel empowered to speak up and invoke a hard stop if they do not agree that all ele&#173;ments of the Universal Protocol have been satisfied. Wrong-&#173;site surgery is considered a sentinel event and, in many states, must be reported to the state board of medicine.</p>

			<p class="h1">Intraoperative Considerations</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top7">
			<p class="h2-h1">Systemic Anesthetic Agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The use of balanced general anesthesia, in which small amounts of several dif&#173;fer&#173;ent types of medi&#173;cations are titrated to avoid the adverse effects of a large dose of any one type, has been effective in reducing prolonged anesthesia and prolonged recovery time. The use of neuromuscular blocking agents of short duration (12 minutes for mivacurium and 30 minutes for atracurium and vecuronium) administered with an infusion pump allow the anesthesiologist to fine-&#173;tune the degree of neuromuscular blockade during balanced anesthesia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The shorter-&#173;acting narcotics such as sufentanil have potencies up to 1000 times &#173;those of morphine. &#173;These agents help provide short-&#173;term stability of hemodynamics during intensive stimulation without prolonged excessive postoperative sedation, as seen with fentanyl. Using such agents immediately before intubation as part of an anesthetic induction has become nearly universal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Management of postoperative nausea and vomiting &#173;after general anesthesia has become easier with the use of more power&#173;ful antinausea medi&#173;cations such as ondansetron. Postoperative pain can be prophylactically treated during the procedure with IV ketorolac in a 30-mg to 60-mg dose or with small titrated doses of IV fentanyl in the range of 50–100 <span class="greek--tx-">μ</span>g. &#173;Because of its pain-&#173;reducing qualities, &#173;there is evidence that IV ketorolac can also reduce the amount of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients who have under&#173;gone strabismus surgery or other procedures requiring general anesthesia. &#173;There is no evidence that this par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drug increases postoperative bleeding &#173;after ophthalmic surgery. However, &#173;because of the reported gastrointestinal complications of higher doses of ketorolac, patients older than 60&#160;years should receive a total of no more than 30&#160;mg of IV ketorolac.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sedation is an impor&#173;tant part of comfortable regional or general anesthesia in a &#173;patient undergoing elective surgery. Anxiolytics such as midazolam can be given intramuscularly (1–4&#160;mg) 30–60 minutes before the procedure or intravenously (0.5–2.0&#160;mg) 2–3 minutes before the stimulus of the anesthetic block. Midazolam is a more appropriate sedative than diazepam for outpatient surgery &#173;because its elimination half-&#173;life is 2–4 hours whereas diazepam’s half-&#173;life is 20–40 hours. The effects of midazolam can also be reversed with flumazenil. Careful IV titration of sedatives and narcotics is impor&#173;tant in older patients to avoid oversedation or respiratory depression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Alfentanil can be given intravenously in titrated doses with appropriate anesthesia monitoring. Its peak effect occurs in 1–2 minutes and lasts 10–20 minutes. Fentanyl &#173;citrate, which has a peak effect in 3–5 minutes and lasts approximately 30 minutes, is also given in titrated doses during regional or topical anesthesia. &#173;These agents are used for sedation as well as for their analgesic properties. The effects of narcotics can be reversed with the antagonist naloxone, given intravenously.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thiopental sodium, a barbiturate used for rapid sequence induction, is no longer available in the United States. Propofol is the drug of choice for most patients due to its rapid hypnotic effect, antiemetic effects, rapid clearance, and fast recovery. It must be given through a large-&#173;bore vein or administered &#173;after a lidocaine flush of the IV line to avoid significant burning on administration. Propofol is a lipid-&#173;based medi&#173;cation that supports rapid bacterial growth at room temperature. Extrinsically contaminated propofol has been associated with postoperative infections, including endogenous endophthalmitis. It is therefore imperative that hospital personnel involved in the preparation, &#173;handling, and administration of this drug adhere to strict aseptic technique during its use.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Local Anesthetic Agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Local anesthetic injection into the retrobulbar space can lead to apnea, respiratory &#173;arrest, and cranial nerve palsies on the side being injected, or even on the opposite side. Anatomical studies of the position of the retrobulbar needle in relation to the optic nerve during injection show that it is pos&#173;si&#173;ble to inject anesthetic into the subdural space with a standard Atkinson-&#173;type needle. Cases of cranial nerve palsies associated with respiratory difficulties represent &#173;actual brainstem anesthesia from injection of the anesthetic agent into the subdural space, with subsequent diffusion into the circulating cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several suggestions have been made to avoid such complications, including changing the traditional positioning of the eye during the retrobulbar anesthetic injection so that the nerve is rotated away from the track of the needle (ie, having the patient look straight ahead, rather than up). Using less sharp, nondisposable retrobulbar &#173;needles that are less than 1<span class="frac">¼</span> inches long also reduces the chance of perforating the optic nerve sheath. Although one case series implicated the concentration of anesthetic as the cause of respiratory arrest, it is more likely that a larger volume and, therefore, a larger total dose of anesthetic was delivered to the brainstem through an inadvertent subdural injection. If apnea, respiratory arrest, or cranial neuropathies occur &#173;after a retrobulbar injection, the patient’s airway must be supported with mask ventilation. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Apnea seldom lasts more than 30–50 minutes, but it is impor&#173;tant that experienced medical personnel stabilize the patient’s condition during this time. The peribulbar technique was devised, in part, to avoid such complications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Respiratory distress and dysphagia can result from the Nadbath facial nerve block, an injection into the stylomastoid foramen that is used to provide facial akinesia. &#173;These complications occur when the anesthetic agent is injected deeply into the area of the facial nerve as it exits the stylomastoid foramen, and the anesthetic bathes cranial nerves IX, X, and XI as they exit the jugular foramen, leading to paralysis of &#173;these nerves. The patient becomes dysphagic, begins to cough or has a hoarse voice, and may develop stridor or severe respiratory insufficiency. &#173;These complications tend to occur in thin persons, in whom it is easier to bury the needle deeply. Managing the respiratory distress requires suctioning the pharynx, positioning the patient on his or her side, and supplementing the patient’s inspired gases with oxygen or even intubation. This complication can be avoided by use of a short hypodermic needle, advancing it only partway into the area to be injected, and injecting a small volume (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>3&#160;mL).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anesthetic toxicity can occur when high concentrations of anesthetic agent are given. For example, if lidocaine 4% is used for a peribulbar injection, the total volume that can be safely given to a 154-lb (70-kg) patient is limited to 8&#160;mL. A smaller patient would be able to tolerate no more than 5&#160;mL of lidocaine 4% without risking complications of systemic toxicity, including confusion, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory depression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Seizures have occurred from the intra-&#173;arterial injection of local anesthetic agent into the ophthalmic artery. Such seizures are nearly instantaneous with injection; supportive mea&#173;sures should include airway maintenance and blood pressure support. The seizures are of short duration.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Malignant Hyperthermia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Malignant hyperthermia (MH)</span> susceptibility is a complex ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorder characterized by hypermetabolic activity leading to crisis following skeletal muscle exposure to a triggering agent. The triggering agent leads to a sharp increase in unbound intracellular calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, stimulating sustained muscle contracture. When the oxygen supply to the muscle is depleted, anaerobic metabolism shift develops, resulting in lactic metabolic acidosis. Fi&#173;nally, &#173;after all energy stores are depleted, rhabdomyolysis occurs, resulting in hyperkalemia and myoglobinuria, the latter of which &#173;causes acute renal failure. Hyperthermia results from the increased metabolic state.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The earliest signs of MH include tachycardia and elevated end-&#173;tidal carbon dioxide level. Labile blood pressure, tachypnea, sweating, muscle rigidity, blotchy discoloration of skin, cyanosis, and dark urine all signal progression of the disorder. Elevation of temperature, which can reach extremely high levels, is a relatively late sign. Ultimately, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, elevated creatine kinase myoglobinuria, and renal failure can occur, as can disseminated intravascular coagulation and death.</p>
			<p class="h3">Ge&#173;ne&#173;tics, risk &#173;factors, and triggering agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 50% of cases of MH susceptibility are autosomal dominant, and the &#173;others arise as de novo mutations. According to the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS; <a href="http://www.mhaus.org">www.&#173;mhaus.&#173;org</a>), the prevalence is 1&#160;in 2000 individuals, but &#173;because of variable expressivity and penetrance, the &#173;actual number of cases is far fewer than gene prevalence would indicate. The affected genes are &#173;those that code for proteins involving the calcium channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to known familial susceptibility, diagnosis of certain muscle disorders raises suspicion for MH susceptibility, especially &#173;those disorders associated with ryanodine receptor mutations. Conditions previously associated with MH that are no longer felt to represent a greater risk include Noonan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, myotonias, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The preoperative history can also help determine &#173;whether a patient is at risk for malignant hyperthermia. However, a negative history <span class="italic">does </span><span class="italic">not</span> rule out MH susceptibility, &#173;because nearly 50% of patients who develop MH have had 1 or 2 prior uneventful exposures to a triggering agent. Patients with a history of unexpected exertional-&#173; or heat-&#173;induced rhabdomyolysis, as well as &#173;those with a history of severe statin-&#173;induced myopathy, are at increased risk for MH.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Triggering agents for MH include volatile halogenated inhalational anesthetics such as halothane, sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, and enflurane as well as succinylcholine.</p>
			<p class="h3">Susceptibility testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients determined to be at high risk for MH may require a muscle biopsy for muscle contracture evaluation (caffeine halothane contracture test) or ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing. A negative contracture test essentially rules out MH susceptibility. However, the false-&#173;positive rate is 20%, and a positive contracture test should be followed by ge&#173;ne&#173;tic analy&#173;sis. However, even if no DNA variation or a DNA variation of undetermined significance is found, this does not mean that MH susceptibility is definitely ruled out. Treatment is indicated based on the preoperative clinical impression<span class="italic">.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Prevention and treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients who are deemed susceptible for MH can be safely anesthetized using &#173;nontriggering agents. The anesthesia machine should be cleaned of any traces of volatile anesthetics. Safe, nontriggering agents include all intravenous anesthetics and sedative agents (eg, &#173;propofol, ketamine, and barbiturates), all local anesthetics (eg, lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine), nondepolarizing muscular blockers, analgesics, and anxiolytics. Prophylactic dantrolene is not recommended.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When MH occurs, it is treated as a medical emergency (see <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;15-1</span> for the treatment protocol). Before dantrolene, mortality was as high as 70%–80%; now, the rate is less than 5%.
