			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Despite formidable immune and mechanical defense systems, the &#173;human body harbors an extensive, well-&#173;adapted population of microorganisms on the skin and in the gastrointestinal, vaginal, and upper respiratory tracts. The organisms maintain their foothold on &#173;these epithelial surfaces chiefly by adherence, and they indirectly benefit the host by excluding pathogenic bacterial colonization and by priming the immune system. If anti&#173;microbial agents alter this host–&#173;microbe interplay by eliminating the normal flora, the host’s susceptibility to normally excluded pathogenic microorganisms is increased. When the mechanical defenses of the epithelial layers are breached and normally sterile areas are exposed, or if a critical component of the immune system that usually prevents microbial invasion fails, severe infections can result from the normal microbial flora.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The components of the immune system of multicellular organisms are sorted into 2 categories. The first, <span class="italic">innate immunity,</span> is pres&#173;ent in nearly all multicellular organisms and includes humoral and cellular immune receptors that have broad specificity. The innate immune response is usually immediate; &#173;there is no immune memory of prior exposure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The second category, <span class="italic">adaptive immunity,</span> is found only in vertebrates and does involve immune memory of prior exposure. Pathogens are recognized by many randomly generated B-&#173;lymphocyte and T-&#173;lymphocyte receptors, each of which has a very narrow specificity, that can recognize a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar antigen (epitope). Adaptive immune response is initially slower (days), &#173;because the clones of responding immune cells take time to proliferate. &#173;After the first encounter, the adaptive immune response is faster and stronger, &#173;because of immunologic memory.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, even when both the mechanical and immune defense systems are intact, pathogenic microbes can cause infections by means of specific virulent characteristics that allow the microbes to invade and multiply. &#173;These virulent traits vary among dif&#173;fer&#173;ent species and include attachment, polysaccharide encapsulation, blocking of lysosomal fusion, antigenic surface variation, immunoglobulin A protease, endotoxins, exotoxins, and biofilm formation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The immune system, which makes pos&#173;si&#173;ble the host’s adaptive response to colonization and infection, is classically divided into the humoral and cellular immune systems. The <span class="italic">humoral immune system,</span> composed of cells derived from the B lymphocytes, is responsible for antibody-&#173;mediated opsonization, complement-&#173;mediated bacterial killing, antitoxin, and mediation of intracellular infections. The <span class="italic">cellular immune system,</span> determined by the T lymphocytes, is responsible for interaction with and stimulation of the humoral immune system, direct cytotoxicity, release of chemical messengers, and control of chronic infections. The successful interplay between the humoral and cellular immune systems mitigates and usually eradicates infections, allowing for repair and healing. Also see BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation.</span></p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Staphylococcus</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> colonizes the anterior nares and other skin sites in 15% of community isolates. Of the tertiary care hospital isolates, more than 25% are resistant to all <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactam antibiotics. The increasing prevalence of methicillin-&#173;resistant <span class="italic">S aureus</span> (MRSA) in tertiary referral hospitals appears to be related to the population of high-&#173;risk patients at such centers. Unfortunately, MRSA is now an increasingly common cause of serious infection in primary care settings as well.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Acute serious staphylococcal infections require immediate intravenous antibiotic therapy. A penicillinase-&#173;resistant penicillin or first-&#173;generation cephalosporin is normally used, pending the results of susceptibility tests.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Since 1997, infections due to strains of <span class="italic">S aureus</span> with reduced susceptibility to vanco&#173;mycin (glycopeptide-&#173;intermediate <span class="italic">S aureus</span>) have been identified, and their frequency is increasing throughout the world. Some reported cases have been successfully treated with vari&#173;ous forms of combination therapy, and newer antibiotics including daptomycin, evernimicin, linezolid, ceftaroline, and quinupristin/dalfopristin.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> is an almost universal inhabitant of the skin; it is pres&#173;ent in up to 90% of skin cultures. It can cause infection when local defenses are compromised. Its characteristic adherence to prosthetic devices makes it the most common cause of prosthetic heart valve infections, and it is a common infectious organism of intravenous catheters and cerebrospinal fluid shunts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most isolates are resistant to methicillin and cephalosporins; therefore, the drug of choice is vancomycin, occasionally in combination with rifampin or gentamicin. Unfortunately, &#173;there have also been reports of vancomycin-&#173;resistant infections caused by coagulase-&#173;negative <span class="italic">Staphylococcus.</span> In addition to antibiotic therapy, management usually involves removal of the infected prosthetic device or vascular catheter.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Streptococcus</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Group A β-&#173;hemolytic streptococci <span class="italic">(Streptococcus pyogenes)</span> cause a variety of acute suppurative infections via droplet transmission. Suppurative streptococcal infections in &#173;humans include pharyngitis, impetigo, pneumonia, erysipelas, wound and burn infections, puerperal infections, and scarlet fever. Rapid identification with antigen detection tests allows prompt treatment of patients with pharyngitis due to this strain of <span class="italic">Streptococcus</span> and can reduce the risk of spread of infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Streptococcus pyogenes</span> remains highly susceptible to penicillin G; however, in the presence of allergy, erythromycin or (if no cross-&#173;allergy exists) a cephalosporin is substituted. Macrolide-&#173;resistant and clindamycin-&#173;resistant strains of group A β-&#173;hemolytic streptococci have been reported.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Streptococcus pneumoniae</span> are lancet-&#173;shaped diplococci that cause α-&#173;hemolysis on blood agar. Although 10%–30% of the general population carry 1 or more serologic types of pneumococci in the throat, the incidence of and mortality from pneumococcal pneumonia increase sharply &#173;after 50&#160;years of age, with a fatality rate approaching 25%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Besides pneumonia, conditions caused by <span class="italic">S pneumoniae</span> include sinusitis, meningitis, otitis media, and peritonitis. Pneumococci are usually highly susceptible to penicillin, other <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactams, erythromycin, or the newer fluoroquinolones. Routine susceptibility testing should be performed on patients with meningitis, bacteremia, or other life-&#173;threatening infections. Penicillin-&#173;resistant strains of <span class="italic">S pneumoniae</span> have been reported with increasing frequency. Treatment of highly resistant strains may require vancomycin or meropenem. Prophylaxis is available through use of the 23-&#173;valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults and the 13-&#173;valent vaccine for &#173;children (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span>&#160;in this volume).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Between 10% and 35% of cases of community-&#173;acquired infectious endocarditis are caused by <span class="greek--tx-">α</span>-&#173;hemolytic streptococci, while <span class="italic">S aureus</span> accounts for 30%–50% of cases. <span class="italic">S aureus</span> also accounts for 60%–80% of cases of nosocomial endocarditis, with the majority due to MRSA. Prophylaxis for infectious endocarditis is usually not considered necessary for routine ocular surgery but can be considered for surgery involving the nasolacrimal drainage system, the sinuses, or for surgical repair of orbital trauma, if the patient has a high risk of adverse outcome from endocarditis (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;14-1</span>). &#173;These include patients with prosthetic cardiac valves or prosthetic material used to repair cardiac valves, previous endocarditis, certain types of congenital heart disease, and cardiac transplantation with valve regurgitation.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Clostridium difficile</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Clostridium difficile</span> is an endemic anaerobic gram-&#173;positive bacillus that is part of the normal gastrointestinal flora. It has acquired importance &#173;because of its role in the development of pseudomembranous enterocolitis following the use of antibiotics. In &#173;these cases, fever and diarrhea develop 1–14 days &#173;after the start of antibiotic therapy. The diarrhea occasionally becomes bloody and typically contains a cytopathic toxin that is elaborated by <span class="italic">C difficile.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Enzyme immunoassay and PCR tests allow for rapid detection. The most frequently implicated antibiotics include clindamycin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, and the cephalosporins. New, hypervirulent strains of <span class="italic">C difficile</span> have &#173; emerged recently in the United States, Eu&#173;rope, and Japan. Initial treatment includes discontinuing the causative antibiotic and administering metronidazole for 10 days. Vancomycin should be used only in patients who cannot tolerate or have not responded to metronidazole, or in situations in which metronidazole use is contraindicated, such as during the first trimester of pregnancy. Bezlotoxumab, a &#173;human monoclonal antibody against <span class="italic">C difficile</span> toxin B, is associated with a rate of recurrent infection that is 38% lower than that associated with standard-&#173;of-&#173;care therapy alone.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Haemophilus influenzae</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Haemophilus influenzae</span>, a small pleiomorphic gram-&#173;negative coccobacillus, is a common inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract in 20%–50% of healthy adults and 80% of &#173;children. <span class="italic">H influenzae</span> is 1 of the 3 organisms responsible for most cases of bacterial meningitis. Roughly 14% of patients with meningitis develop significant neurologic damage. Other infections caused by this organism include orbital cellulitis, epiglottitis, arthritis, otitis media, bronchitis, pericarditis, sinusitis, and pneumonia. A DNA PCR probe assay can be used for rapid diagnosis of the most virulent strain, <span class="italic">H influenzae</span> type b (Hib) infections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of acute <span class="italic">H influenzae</span> infections has been complicated by the emergence of <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactamase strains, with an incidence approaching 50% in some geographic areas. Current recommendations are to treat with third-&#173;generation cephalosporins, which are highly effective against <span class="italic">H influenzae</span> infections. Alternative treatments include meropenem or ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Nearly all isolates of <span class="italic">H influenzae</span> are resistant to macrolides. Serious or life-&#173;threatening infections should be treated with an intravenous third-&#173;generation cephalosporin with known activity against <span class="italic">H influenzae,</span> such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, pending results of sensitivity testing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hib conjugate vaccines are available for use in infants and have shown their effectiveness in protecting infants and older &#173;children against meningitis and other invasive diseases caused by Hib infection. The incidence of meningitis, orbital cellulitis, and other infections caused by Hib has been reduced significantly since Hib conjugate vaccines became available. However, it is impor&#173;tant to remember that immunized patients are still susceptible to infections caused by strains of <span class="italic">H influenzae</span> other than type b.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Neisseria</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The common pathogenic <span class="italic">Neisseria</span> species are meningococci and gonococci. Meningococci can be cultured in up to 15% of healthy persons in nonepidemic periods. Virulence is determined by the polysaccharide capsule and the potent endotoxic activity of the cell wall, which can cause cardiovascular collapse, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Persons who are complement deficient or asplenic are at risk for serious clinical infections. Diagnostic testing may include Gram stain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures, enzyme-&#173;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and PCR. An automated fluo&#173;rescent multiplex PCR assay that can si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously detect <span class="italic">N meningitidis, H influenzae,</span> and <span class="italic">S </span><span class="italic">pneumoniae</span> can be used to evaluate patients with suspected meningitis. This test provides extremely high sensitivity and a specificity of 100% for each organism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The range of meningococcal infections includes meningitis, mild to severe upper respiratory tract infections, and, less often, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, pericarditis, arthritis, and purpura fulminans. <span class="italic">Neisseria meningitidis</span> serogroup B is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in &#173;children and young adults. Meningitis with a petechial or purpuric exanthem is the classic pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, although each may occur in isolation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Historically, the treatment of choice for meningococcal meningitis has been high-&#173;dose penicillin or, in the case of allergy, chloramphenicol or a third-&#173;generation cephalosporin. Rifampin or minocycline is used as chemoprophylaxis for &#173;family members and intimate personal contacts of the infected individual. Polysaccharide vaccines are most effective in older &#173;children and adults.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Among &#173;women with gonococcal infections, 50% are asymptomatic, whereas 95% of men with gonococcal infections are symptomatic. Asymptomatic patients are infectious for several months, with a transmissibility rate of 20%–50%. Nonsexual transmission is rare. The key to prevention is identification and treatment of asymptomatic carriers and their sexual contacts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The range of gonococcal infections includes cervicitis; urethritis; pelvic inflammatory disease; pharyngitis; conjunctivitis; ophthalmia neonatorum; and disseminated gono&#173;coccal disease with fever, polyarthralgias, and rash. <span class="italic">Chlamydia trachomatis</span> coexists with gonorrhea in 25%–50% of &#173;women with gonococcal cervicitis and 20%–33% of men with gonococcal urethritis. Diagnosis of gonococcal infections, as well as infections caused by many other bacteria, mycobacteria, viruses, and <span class="italic">Mycoplasma,</span> has been aided by the development of highly &#173;sensitive DNA probes that use PCR techniques.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because penicillin-&#173;resistant and tetracycline-&#173;resistant gonococcal strains have become common in many areas of the United States, treatment should be tailored to their local prevalence. Tetracycline is effective for patients who are infected by susceptible strains, are allergic to penicillin, or have concurrent chlamydial infections. Ceftriaxone (via intramuscular injection) is the drug of choice for penicillinase-&#173;resistant strains; thus far, reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic has been extremely rare. Alternatives include oral cefixime, cefuroxime, azithromycin, and the fluoroquinolones. The macrolides and fluoroquinolones have the added benefit of excellent activity against concomitant <span class="italic">C trachomatis</span> infection. However, gonococcal isolates with reduced sensitivity to macrolides and fluoroquinolones have been reported with increasing frequency, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that clinicians no longer use fluoroquinolones as a first-&#173;line treatment for gonorrhea, leaving cephalosporins as the only class of antimicrobials available for treatment of gonorrhea in the United States.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span> is a gram-&#173;negative bacillus found in moist environments. &#173;Together with <span class="italic">Serratia marcescens, P aeruginosa</span> is 1 of the 2 most consistently antimicrobial-&#173;resistant pathogenic bacteria. The virulence of pseudomonas is related to extracellular toxins, endotoxin, and a polysaccharide protection from phagocytosis. Usual sites of infection include the respiratory system, skin, eyes, urinary tract, bone, and wounds. Systemic infections caused by a resistant organism carry a high mortality rate and are usually associated with depressed immunity, often in a hospital setting.</p>
			<p class="body-text">More than half of <span class="italic">P aeruginosa</span> isolates are now resistant to aminoglycosides. Ceftazidime has been the most effective cephalosporin for treatment of pseudomonal infections. Piperacillin-&#173;tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem also remain highly effective against most isolates, but re&#173;sis&#173;tance to the carbapenems and fluoroquinolones has been increasing gradually.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-11">Syphilis, caused by the bacterium <span class="italic">Treponema pallidum,</span> is spread by &#173;either sexual contact or transmission from a pregnant &#173;woman to her fetus. The course of the disease is divided into 4 stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary (late). Initial inoculation occurs through intact mucous membranes or abraded skin and, within 6 weeks, results in a small ulcerated, painless papule called a <span class="italic">chancre.</span> The spirochetes readily enter the lymphatic system and bloodstream. The chancre heals spontaneously, and signs of dissemination appear &#173;after a variable quiescent period of several weeks to months.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The secondary stage is heralded by a truncal rash that may spread over the entire body. Fever, malaise, adenopathy, and hair loss may occur. Meningitis, uveitis, optic neuritis, and hepatitis may also occur, but are less common. The secondary lesions may resolve in a few weeks or may relapse in the first year. Without treatment, the disease enters the latent stage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Latent syphilis, which is characterized by positive serologic test results in a patient without clinical signs, is divided into 2 stages. The <span class="italic">early latent stage</span> occurs within 1 year of infection. During this time, the disease is potentially transmissible, &#173;because relapses associated with spirochetemia are pos&#173;si&#173;ble. The <span class="italic">late latent stage</span> is associated with immunity to relapse and re&#173;sis&#173;tance to infectious lesions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tertiary manifestations can occur many years &#173;after the initial untreated infection. Up to one-&#173;third of untreated cases of latent disease pro&#173;gress to this stage; the remaining two-&#173;thirds &#173;either are subclinical or resolve spontaneously. <span class="italic">Tertiary disease</span> is characterized by destructive granulomatous lesions with a typical endarteritis that can affect the skin, bones, joints, oral and nasal cavities, parenchymal organs, cardiovascular system, eyes, meninges, and central ner&#173;vous system (CNS).</p>
			<p class="body-text">On pathologic examination, obliterative endarteritis with a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasma cells is a feature of all active stages of syphilis.

Ocular syphilis manifests most commonly as posterior uveitis or panuveitis, but it can also pres&#173;ent with interstitial keratitis, anterior uveitis, optic neuropathy, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most cases of syphilis are diagnosed serologically. <span class="italic">Nontreponemal tests</span> such as the VDRL test or rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test are usually positive during the early stages of the disease, uniformly positive during the secondary stage, and progressively nonreactive in the &#173;later stages. Nontreponemal test results become predictably negative &#173;after successful therapy and can be used to assess the efficacy of treatment; however, in patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases, false-&#173;positive results can occur, especially in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;9</span>&#160;in this volume).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Treponemal tests</span> include the fluo&#173;rescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-&#173;ABS) test, the hemagglutination treponemal test for syphilis (HATTS), the <span class="italic">T pallidum</span> hemagglutination assay (TPHA), and the microhemagglutination test for <span class="italic">T pallidum</span> (MHA-&#173;TP). Treponemal antibody detection tests are more specific than nontreponemal tests, and should be considered confirmatory, especially in cases in the &#173;later stages of disease. False-&#173;positive results of treponemal tests can occur in 15% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, in patients with other treponemal infections or Lyme disease, and, in rare instances, in patients who have lymphosarcoma or who are pregnant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ELISA, Western blot, and DNA PCR techniques may allow more rapid and accurate diagnosis of congenital syphilis and neurosyphilis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of syphilis is determined by disease stage and by CNS involvement. <span class="italic">Treponema pallidum</span> is exquisitely sensitive to penicillin, which remains the treatment of choice for all stages. In pregnant &#173;women, penicillin is the only treatment option. Acceptable alternatives to penicillin include erythromycin, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, doxy&#173;cycline, and the cephalosporins.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of ocular syphilis and neurosyphilis is &#173;either aqueous crystalline penicillin G IV or procaine penicillin IM with probenecid for 10–14 days. Per the CDC, cases of ocular syphilis should be reported to the local or state health department.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lumbar puncture should be performed to determine cerebrospinal fluid involvement in several circumstances, namely in cases of latent syphilis of more than 1 year’s duration, suspected neurosyphilis, treatment failure, HIV coinfection, high RPR titers (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>1:32), and evidence of other late manifestations (cardiac involvement, gummata). &#173;Either penicillin G or a single oral dose of azithromycin has been recommended for treatment of patients who &#173;were recently exposed to a sexual partner with infectious syphilis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many reports have described an accelerated clinical course of syphilis in HIV-&#173;infected patients; furthermore, such patients may experience an incomplete response to standard therapy. A patient coinfected with HIV and syphilis often requires a longer and more intensive treatment regimen, ongoing follow-up to assess for recurrence, and a complete neurologic workup with an aggressive cerebrospinal fluid investigation for evidence of neurosyphilis. Ceftriaxone compares favorably with intravenous penicillin for the treatment of neurosyphilis in HIV-&#173;coinfected patients. Patients with any stage of clinical syphilis should be tested for HIV serostatus.</p>

			<div id="Chapt14_Top10">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi,</span> a large plasmid-&#173;containing spirochete, is transmitted to &#173;humans and domestic animals through the bite of the <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> genus of ticks. The illness caused by this transmission, which was first recognized in 1975, is called Lyme disease and is the most common vector-&#173;borne infection in the United States. Although cases have been reported in nearly all states, clusters are apparent in the northeast Atlantic, the upper Midwest, and the Pacific southwest areas, corresponding to the distribution of the <span class="italic">Ixodes</span> tick population. The range of the disease extends throughout Eu&#173;rope and Asia. Two other tick-&#173;borne zoonoses, babesiosis and &#173;human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, can be cotransmitted with Lyme disease.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Stages</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lyme disease usually occurs in 3 stages following a tick bite:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Localized (stage 1):</span> pres&#173;ent in 86% of infected patients. It is characterized by skin involvement, initially a red macule or papule, which &#173;later expands in a circular manner, usually with a bright red border and a central clear indurated area, known as <span class="italic">erythema chronicum migrans.</span></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Disseminated (stage 2):</span> can occur within days to weeks. It manifests as a flulike illness with headaches, fatigue, and musculoskeletal aches.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">Per&#173;sis&#173;tent (stage 3):</span> more profound symptoms occur during this stage, as the infection localizes to the ner&#173;vous, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Neurologic complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, cranial neuritis (including Bell palsy), radiculopathy, and neuropathy occur in 10%–15% of patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Late per&#173;sis&#173;tent manifestations are usually confined to the ner&#173;vous system, skin, and joints. Late neurologic signs include encephalomyelitis as well as demyelinating and psychiatric syndromes. Joint involvement includes asymmetric pauciarticular arthritis; skin involvement is characterized by acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans or localized lesions resembling &#173;those of systemic sclerosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other systemic manifestations during the initial dissemination or the late per&#173;sis&#173;tent state include uveitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, neuritis, lymphadenopathy, orbital myositis, hematuria, and orchitis. In some studies, serologic testing of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome has shown an increased incidence of positive results for <span class="italic">B burgdorferi</span> antibodies.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The serologic tests most commonly used to aid in the diagnosis of Lyme disease are the immunofluorescence antibody assay or the more sensitive ELISA. The ELISA is 50% sensitive during the early stages of the disease, and almost all symptomatic patients test seropositive during the &#173;later disseminated and per&#173;sis&#173;tent phases of the infection. &#173;These tests should be used only to support a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease, not as the primary basis for making diagnostic or treatment decisions. Positive IgG and IgM ELISA results are usually confirmed with Western immunoblot testing. Serologic testing is not as useful for individuals who are early in the course of Lyme disease &#173;because of the low sensitivity. Serologic testing is more helpful in &#173;later disease, when the sensitivity and specificity are greater. False-&#173;positive results can occur in patients with syphilis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, yaws, pinta, <span class="italic">Borrelia recurrentis</span> infection, and vari&#173;ous rheumatologic disorders. PCR has been used to detect <span class="italic">B burgdorferi</span> DNA in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Although patients with Lyme disease may test positive on the FTA-&#173;ABS test for syphilis, their VDRL test result should be nonreactive.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of <span class="italic">B burgdorferi</span> infection depends on the stage and severity of the infection. Early Lyme disease is typically treated with oral doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, or erythromycin. Mild disseminated disease is treated with oral doxycycline or amoxicillin. Serious disease (with cardiac or neurologic manifestations) is typically treated with ceftriaxone or high-&#173;dose penicillin G for up to 6 weeks. Infections that do not respond to the initial regimen may require alternate or combination therapy.</p>

			<div id="Chapt14_Top11">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Transmitted by close contact, <span class="italic">Chlamydia trachomatis</span> is the causative agent of a common sexually transmitted infection, with 200,000 new cases per year in the United States. More than 15% of pregnant &#173;women and 10% of men with chlamydial infections are asymptomatic. Chlamydia can be transmitted by a pregnant &#173;woman to her newborn during delivery, resulting in pneumonia or conjunctivitis in the infant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chlamydial infections in &#173;humans include trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, nongonococcal urethritis, epididymitis, mucopurulent cervicitis, proctitis, salpingitis, infant pneumonia syndrome, and lymphogranuloma venereum. Genital <span class="italic">C trachomatis</span> infection can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal infertility, and ec&#173;topic pregnancy. Diagnostic techniques include culture, direct immunofluorescence antibody testing of exudates, enzyme immunoassay, and DNA PCR probe assay.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chlamydial infections are readily treated with tetracycline, erythromycin, or one of the quinolones or macrolides. Although single-&#173;dose azithromycin therapy for urethritis and cervicitis has proved effective in some studies, it is usually recommended that patients continue treatment for at least 7 days to ensure complete eradication. Sexual partners of patients with chlamydial infections or other sexually transmitted infections should be examined and counseled for consideration of antibiotic treatment as well.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis is treated with oral erythromycin (50&#160;mg/kg divided, 4 times daily) for 14 days. See BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for more information.</p>

Most cases, and resulting deaths, occur in developing countries, with the largest number of new cases occurring in Asia and Africa. Hansen disease (leprosy) is caused by <span class="italic">Mycobacterium leprae </span>and<span class="italic"> Mycobacterium lepromatosis.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) consist of the other mycobacteria that can cause lung disease resembling tuberculosis, lymphadenitis, skin disease, and bacteremia. Multidrug-&#173;resistant NTM, also known as <span class="italic">Mycobacterium abscessus</span> complex, are more difficult to treat &#173;because of their re&#173;sis&#173;tance to standard antituberculous regimens.</p>
			<p class="h2">Tuberculosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infection with <span class="italic">M tuberculosis</span> usually occurs through inhalation of infective droplets and, in rare cases, by way of the skin or gastrointestinal tract. Infection mainly involves the lungs but can spread systemically and involve any organ system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test mea&#173;sures delayed hypersensitivity to tuberculoprotein. A positive PPD reaction is defined as a 10&#160;mm or greater area of induration in the area of intradermal injection of 0.1 milliliter (mL) of PPD, read 48–72 hours &#173;after the injection. A false-&#173;positive test may occur in patients who have been vaccinated with the BCG vaccine. Therefore, blood tests are used in patients who have received the BCG vaccine; they are also used in patients who are high risk and have a negative skin test. &#173;These tuberculosis (TB) blood tests include the Interferon-&#173;<span class="greek--tx-">γ</span> release assay tests (eg, the QuantiFERON-&#173;TB Gold and the T-&#173;SPOT.TB tests). Following positive skin test results, chest x-&#173;ray, chest computed tomography, and sputum samples aid in diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of active TB infection consists of intensive therapy with daily isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB) for 8 weeks. EMB may be discontinued following confirmation of drug regimen susceptibility. The intensive therapy is followed by continuation therapy with daily INH and rifampin for 18 weeks, or thrice weekly INH and rifampin for 18 weeks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All currently used agents have toxic adverse effects, especially hepatic and neurologic; patients should be carefully monitored during the course of therapy. INH and EMB can cause optic neuropathy in a small percentage of patients, and rifampin may cause pink-&#173;tinged tears and blepharoconjunctivitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Outbreaks of nosocomial and community-&#173;acquired multidrug-&#173;resistant TB (MDRTB; meaning TB that is resistant to INH and RIF) have increased, particularly in the presence of concurrent HIV infection. MDRTB in HIV-&#173;infected patients is associated with widely disseminated disease, poor treatment response, and substantial mortality. MDRTB infection has also been documented in health care workers exposed to &#173;these patients. Treatment of MDRTB involves using at least 3 agents from the following medi&#173;cations or classes of medi&#173;cations: a fluoroquinolone (eg, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin), an injectable aminoglycoside (eg, amikacin, kanamycin, streptomycin, capreomycin), PZA, EMB, cycloserine, para-&#173;aminosalicylic acid, terizidone, a thioamide (eg, ethionamide, prothionamide), and the newer agent bedaquiline. &#173;These agents are used for at least 18–24 months following sputum culture conversion.</p>

			<div id="Chapt14_Top14">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> is a yeast that is pres&#173;ent in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract in 40%–60% of healthy adults. In individuals with disrupted local defenses or depressed immunity, overgrowth and parenchymal invasion can occur, with the potential for systemic spread. Associated infections include oral lesions (thrush) and vaginal, skin, esophageal, and urinary tract involvement. Chronic mucocutaneous lesions may occur in persons with specific T-&#173;lymphocyte defects. Disseminated disease can involve any organ system, most commonly the kidneys, brain, heart, and eyes, and is more common in immunocompromised patients and &#173;those with indwelling vascular catheters.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other impor&#173;tant invasive fungal infections are cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, aspergillosis, and coccidioidomycosis. Invasive fungal infections are a major prob&#173;lem in immunocompromised patients. Fungal PCR assays allow more rapid diagnosis of serious fungal infections and offer higher sensitivity compared with fungal cultures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of serious systemic infections has traditionally involved the use of intravenous amphotericin B, sometimes combined with flucytosine or an imidazole. Lipid complex and liposome-&#173;encapsulated formulations of amphotericin B &#173;were developed to reduce the nephrotoxic and myelosuppressive effects of this drug. Imidazoles, such as fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole, are less toxic and better-&#173;tolerated alternatives. Please see the section Antifungal Agents &#173;later in this chapter.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-18">Toxoplasma</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top15">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Toxoplasmosis is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite <span class="italic">Toxoplasma gondii,</span> which infects up to one-&#173;third of the world’s population. Although acute infections may be asymptomatic in pregnant &#173;women, the infection can be transmitted to the fetus and cause severe complications, including cognitive impairment, blindness, and epilepsy. As many as 4000 new cases of congenital toxoplasmosis occur each year in the United States. Of the nearly 750 US deaths attributed to toxoplasmosis each year, approximately half are believed to be caused by eating contaminated undercooked or raw meat. <span class="italic">Toxoplasma gondii</span> can also be transmitted to &#173;humans by ingestion of oocysts, an environmentally resistant form of the organism, through exposure to cat feces, &#173;water, or soil containing the parasite or from eating unwashed contaminated fruits or vegetables.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Infection can be prevented in large part by cooking meat to a safe temperature, peeling or thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables before eating, and cleaning cooking surfaces and utensils &#173;after they have come into contact with raw meat. Pregnant &#173;women should avoid changing cat litter and &#173;handling raw or undercooked meat. Also, pet &#173;owners should keep cats indoors, where they are less likely to eat infected prey and subsequently acquire <span class="italic">T gondii.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Primary infection is usually subclinical, but cervical lymphadenopathy or ocular disease can be pres&#173;ent in some patients. The ocular manifestations include uveitis and chorioretinitis with macular scarring. The clinical picture and histopathology of toxoplasmosis reflect the immune response. In immunocompromised patients, reactivation of latent disease can cause life-&#173;threatening encephalitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnosis of toxoplasmosis can be established by direct detection of the parasite or by serologic techniques. Real-&#173;time PCR is a very sensitive technique for diagnosing infection caused by <span class="italic">T gondii</span> and for determining the precise genotype of the organism. In the past, the most commonly used therapeutic regimen was pyrimethamine combined with sulfadiazine and folinic acid. Recently, this regimen has been largely replaced by trimethoprim-&#173;sulfamethoxazole (TMP-&#173;SMX), which is more readily available and less expensive. Other drugs with activity against <span class="italic">T gondii</span> include azithromycin, atovaquone, and clindamycin.

Type 1 is HSV-1; type 2 is HSV-2; type 3 is VZV; type 4 is EBV; type 5 is CMV; &#173;human herpesvirus types 6A, 6B, and 7 are known as HHV-6A, HHV-6B, and HHV-7, respectively; and type 8 (HHV-8) is associated with Kaposi sarcoma.</p>
			<p class="h2">Herpes Simplex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 are members of the Herpesviridae &#173;family. HSV type 1 and 2 infections differ in severity and clinical manifestation; many persons with HSV antibodies are asymptomatic. Latent infection of sensory and autonomic ganglia can occur. Reactivation of HSV from the trigeminal ganglia may be associated with asymptomatic excretion or with the development of mucosal herpetic ulceration. Serologic testing, DNA PCR testing, and viral culture can help diagnose difficult cases, particularly CNS infections.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">HSV-1</span> is associated with mucocutaneous infections of the pharynx, skin, oral cavity, vagina, eye, and brain. Ophthalmic infection most often manifests as corneal dendritic or stromal disease but may pres&#173;ent as acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis. (The ocular manifestations of HSV infection are discussed in more detail in BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> and Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation.</span>) Herpes encephalitis carries a 10%–20% mortality rate. <span class="italic">HSV</span>-&#173;<span class="italic">2</span> infection is an impor&#173;tant sexually transmitted disease that is associated with genital infections, aseptic meningitis, and congenital infection. <span class="italic">Neonatal herpes infection</span> affects around 1&#160;in 3500 babies born in the United states and is defined by vertical transmission from &#173;mother to infant within the first 28 days of life. Neonatal herpes infection involves multiple systems and, if untreated, has a mortality rate around 25%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The drug of choice for treating acute systemic infections is acyclovir. Localized disease can be treated with oral acyclovir. Topical treatment of skin or mucocutaneous lesions with acyclovir ointment decreases the healing time. Oral acyclovir can also be used prophylactically for severe and recurrent genital herpes. Long-&#173;term suppressive oral acyclovir (400&#160;mg twice a day) also reduces the recurrence of herpes simplex epithelial keratitis and stromal keratitis. Intravenous acyclovir is used to treat herpes encephalitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Famciclovir and valacyclovir are also approved in the United States for the treatment of herpes zoster and herpes simplex infections. Compared with acyclovir, &#173;these agents have better bioavailability, achieve higher blood levels, and require less frequent dosing. HSV is also sensitive to vidarabine. Cidofovir or foscarnet can also be used to treat acyclovir-&#173;resistant herpes simplex.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-17">Varicella-&#173;Zoster</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Varicella-&#173;zoster virus, also sometimes referred to as <span class="italic">herpes zoster,</span> produces infection in a manner similar to that of HSV. &#173;After a primary infection, VZV remains latent in dorsal root ganglia; host cellular immune interaction inhibits reactivation. Primary infection usually occurs in childhood in the form of <span class="italic">chickenpox (varicella),</span> a generalized vesicular rash accompanied by mild constitutional symptoms. Reactivation may be heralded by pain in a sensory nerve distribution, followed by a unilateral vesicular eruption occurring over 1 to 3 dermatomic areas. New crops of lesions appear in the same area within 7 days. Resolution of the lesions may be followed by postherpetic neuralgia. Other neurologic sequelae following VZV reactivation include segmental myelitis, Guillain-&#173;Barr<span class="accent">é</span> syndrome, and Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The incidence of VZV is 2 or 3 times higher in patients older than 60&#160;years. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs &#173;after VZV infection in approximately 50% of patients older than 50&#160;years. The pain of postherpetic neuralgia can be severe and debilitating and may persist for months or even years. Immunosuppressed persons experience recurrent lesions and an increased incidence of disseminated disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For immunocompetent adults with cutaneous VZV infection, recommended 7-&#173;day treatment regimens include famciclovir (500&#160;mg twice a day), valacyclovir (1000&#160;mg 3 times a day), and acyclovir (800&#160;mg 5 times a day). Treatment of acute infection in immunocompromised patients or &#173;those with visceral involvement may include acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir. Newer drugs being evaluated for resistant VZV strains or concomitant HIV infection include sorivudine, brivudine, fialuridine, fiacitabine, netivudine, lobucavir, foscarnet, and cidofovir.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Varivax, a live attenuated varicella-&#173;zoster vaccine, is available for use in &#173;children for prevention of primary disease. The CDC recommends Shingrix, a recombinant zoster vaccine given in 2 doses separated by 2 to 6 months, for the prevention of shingles in immunocompetent adults aged 50&#160;years and older. Please see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span>&#160;in this volume for further discussion of varicella zoster vaccines.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some patients, tricyclic antidepressants, pregabalin, gabapentin, and topical capsaicin cream reduce the pain of postherpetic neuralgia. For refractory cases, transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation, nerve blocks, or intrathecal glucocorticoid injections may be helpful.</p>

			<p class="h2">Cytomegalovirus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous &#173;human virus: 50% of adults in developed countries harbor antibodies, which are usually acquired during the first 5&#160;years of life. The virus can be isolated from all body fluids, even in the presence of circulating neutralizing antibodies, for up to several years &#173;after infection. Serologic and PCR testing is available to assist in the diagnosis of CMV infection. The pp65 antigen assay is a sensitive and specific test used to guide antiviral therapy in transplant recipients and detect subclinical disease in high-&#173;risk patients.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Epstein-&#173;Barr Virus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epstein-&#173;Barr virus antibodies are found in over 90% of all adults. Childhood infections are usually asymptomatic, while EBV infection in young adults results in infectious mononucleosis. Lymphoproliferative disorders may develop in transplant recipients taking cyclosporine and in patients with AIDS. EBV is epidemiologically associated with Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-&#173;Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and has also been reported in EBV-&#173;associated hemophagocytic lymphohistio&#173;cytosis (EBV-&#173;HLH), also known as <span class="italic">EBV-&#173;associated hemophagocytic syndrome.</span> This disease develops mostly in &#173;children and young adults and may be fatal. EBV has also been reported as a cause of pediatric acute renal failure. A highly sensitive PCR assay is available for detecting primary EBV infection and infectious mononucleosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of acute disease is largely supportive, although the EBV DNA polymerase is sensitive to acyclovir and ganciclovir, which decrease viral replication in tissue culture.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 20%–40% of acute viral hepatitis cases reported in the United States are of the non-&#173;A, non-&#173;B type; of this group, most cases are caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The prevalence of chronic HCV infection in the United States is 3.5 million individuals; the worldwide prevalence is approximately 71 million individuals. Risk &#173;factors for the transmission of HCV include parenteral drug use, hemodialysis, occupational exposure to HCV-&#173;infected blood, blood transfusion or organ transplant prior to 1992, receiving clotting &#173;factor concentrates prior to 1987, and incarceration. Persons born between 1945 and 1965 have the highest incidence of hepatitis C infection. Although the role of sexual activity in the transmission of HCV remains to be fully elucidated, this mode is not a predominant source of transmission.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Of all the hepatitis viruses, HCV &#173;causes the most damage in immunocompetent hosts &#173;because of direct hepatocyte cytotoxicity. It may cause cirrhosis, fulminant hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. At pres&#173;ent, hepatitis C is the most common cause of liver cancer and the most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A sensitive enzyme immunoassay has been developed for the detection and quantification of total HCV core antigen in anti-&#173;HCV-&#173;positive or anti-&#173;HCV-&#173;negative sera. In addition, a 1-&#173;step PCR assay is available to detect HCV RNA and provide HCV genotyping.</p>

The West Africa Ebola outbreak of 2013–2016 involved over 28,000 reported cases and over 11,000 recorded deaths, mainly in the countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The Ebola virus is believed to be transmitted by fruit bats and affects &#173;humans and nonhuman primates. Of the 5 known viruses belonging to the <span class="italic">Ebolavirus</span> genus, 4 are known to cause disease in &#173;humans, and all are members of the Filoviridae &#173;family of single-&#173;stranded RNA viruses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Ebola virus can be contracted through contact with the blood, body fluid, or tissue of infected bats, primates, or &#173;humans. The virus can penetrate broken skin or mucous membranes, and infection can occur when touching infected blood, body fluids, or contaminated objects. Early symptoms of infection appear 2–21 days &#173;after exposure to the virus and include fever, chills, muscle aches, headache, and weakness. Hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a known pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of infection. &#173;Later symptoms include rash, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, bruising, and bleeding, with eventual multisystem organ failure and death.</p>

			<div id="Chapt14_Top21">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in 1947 from a rhesus macaque monkey from the Zika forest in Uganda. It is a single-&#173;stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus &#173;family Flaviviridae and the genus <span class="italic">Flavivirus</span>, and is related to the dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and West Nile viruses. Its vector of transmission is the female <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> mosquito. Transmission between &#173;humans can occur through sexual intercourse; blood transfusion; and mother-&#173;to-&#173;child vertical transmission via pregnancy, delivery, or breast milk.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The first evidence of &#173;human infection was discovered in Uganda in 1952. Few cases &#173;were identified &#173;until an outbreak in Yap, Micronesia, in 2007. Subsequently, the virus was documented in the Amer&#173;i&#173;cas via the Pacific Islands when an outbreak occurred in Brazil in 2015. Since then, over 1.5 million individuals have been infected with ZIKV in Brazil.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The symptoms of Zika virus infection in adults are mild and self-&#173;limited; many individuals infected with ZIKV are asymptomatic. Symptoms include nonspecific fever, joint and muscle pain, conjunctivitis, and rash.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In northeastern Brazil, a sharp rise in the number of infants born with microcephaly (head circumference <span class="symbol">&lt;</span> 32&#160;cm) occurred 6 months &#173;after the onset of the Zika outbreak. The Zika virus is identified via PCR and serologic testing, which was not readily available in parts of Brazil. Therefore, the association between ZIKV and microcephaly was presumptive. In 2015, 29 infants with microcephaly and a presumed diagnosis of congenital ZIKV infection underwent ophthalmologic examination. The most common vision-threatening ocular abnormalities identified &#173;were focal pigment mottling of the ret&#173;ina, chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy, optic nerve abnormalities, bilateral iris coloboma, and lens subluxation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Since the 2015 Brazil outbreak, vector-&#173;borne transmission of ZIKV infection has been reported in 84 countries, territories, or subnational areas. Recently, the term congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) was coined to describe the devastating ophthalmological, neurological, skeletal, and audiological effects the virus exacts on the developing fetus. The most common ocular findings in infants with CZS are chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy and pigment mottling in the macula similar to that seen in eyes with toxoplasmosis. Zika virus vaccines are currently in development; it remains unknown &#173;whether an approved vaccine &#173;will protect against CZS. Therefore, when examining microcephalic infants in affected areas, ophthalmologists should be aware of the ocular manifestations of suspected congenital ZIKV infection.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-17">Etiology and Pathogenesis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">HIV belongs to a &#173;family of viruses known as <span class="italic">retroviruses.</span> A retrovirus encodes its ge&#173;ne&#173;tic information in RNA and uses a unique viral enzyme named <span class="italic">reverse transcriptase</span> to copy its genome into DNA. HIV has 2 subtypes, HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is further classified into several groups, including M, N, and O. Thus far, &#173;there are 9 known serotypes of HIV-1 group M, and 1 each of HIV-1 groups N and O. In the United States, HIV-1 group M, serotype B is the most common form of HIV. HIV-2, another &#173;human T-&#173;lymphotropic retrovirus, has been isolated in West African individuals and is closely related to simian immunodeficiency virus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">HIV preferentially infects T lymphocytes, especially helper T (CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>) lymphocytes. The virus infects mature T lymphocytes in vitro, although other cells can serve as targets. CD4 is the phenotypic marker for this subset and is identified by monoclonal antibodies OKT4 and Leu-3.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The hallmark of the immunodeficiency in AIDS is a depletion of the CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> helper-&#173;inducer T lymphocytes. HIV selectively infects &#173;these lymphocytes as well as macrophages; with HIV replication, the helper T lymphocytes are killed. &#173;Because the helper T lymphocytes are central to the immune response, loss of this subset results in a profound immune deficiency, leading to the life-&#173;threatening opportunistic infections indicative of AIDS. This selective depletion of CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> helper T lymphocytes leads to the characteristic inverted CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>/CD8<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> ratio (also known as the <span class="italic">T4/T8 ratio</span>), where the ratio drops to less than 1.0, in comparison to the normal CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>/CD8<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> ratio, which is around 2. Years may pass between the initial HIV infection and the development of &#173;these immune abnormalities.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to cellular immunodeficiency, patients with AIDS have abnormalities of B-&#173;lymphocyte function. &#173;These patients are unable to mount an antibody response to novel T lymphocyte–&#173;dependent B-&#173;lymphocyte challenges, although they have B-&#173;lymphocyte hyperfunction with polyclonal B-&#173;lymphocyte activation, hypergammaglobulinemia, and circulating immune complexes. This B-&#173;lymphocyte hyperfunction may be a direct consequence of HIV infection: studies have demonstrated that polyclonal activation can be induced in vitro by adding HIV to B lymphocytes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">HIV has also been documented to infect macrophages in the brains of patients with AIDS. It is thought that HIV infection of the brain is responsible for the HIV encephalo&#173;pathy syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-25">Clinical Syndromes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">HIV infection has 3 phases: acute seroconversion, asymptomatic infection, and AIDS. In the acute seroconversion phase, viremia is high and the CD4<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> helper T lymphocyte cell count falls rapidly. Symptoms, including fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and malaise, typically occur within 2 to 4 weeks &#173;after infection. The second phase of infection can be asympto&#173;matic or pres&#173;ent with per&#173;sis&#173;tent generalized lymphadenopathy. Viral replication occurs and the CD4<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> lymphocyte count steadily declines. This chronic or latent phase can last more than a de&#173;cade. The final stage, AIDS, is defined by a CD4<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> lymphocyte count below 200 cells/microliter of blood or by development of opportunistic infections or malignancy.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-25">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The CDC recommends that &#173;every individual between the ages of 13 and 64 be tested for HIV at least once, and that persons at high risk for HIV infection be screened at least annually. The American College of Physicians encourages testing of all persons. The US Preventive Ser&#173;vices Task Force recommends screening for adolescents and adults at increased risk for HIV infection, and for all pregnant &#173;women.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Risk &#173;factors for exposure to HIV include unprotected sexual intercourse, large number of sexual partners, history of sexually transmitted infection, blood transfusion, needle-&#173;stick injury, sharing of intravenous drug paraphernalia, mucosal contact with infected blood, and mother-&#173;to-&#173;child vertical transmission.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An ELISA test is used for screening. A positive immunoassay should be followed by confirmatory Western blot testing. A rapid detection combination antigen/antibody test is available. The CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> lymphocyte count is used for classification and to monitor for opportunistic infection. The viral load in peripheral blood is used to guide therapy; the rate of progression to AIDS and death is related to viral load.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The workup of a patient with newly diagnosed HIV infection should include an ophthalmologic examination and testing for TB, CMV, syphilis, hepatitis A–&#173;C, <span class="italic">Toxoplasma,</span> chlamydia, and gonococcus.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-25">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is recommended that all patients with early HIV infection begin antiretroviral therapy (ART) as soon as pos&#173;si&#173;ble; initiation of ART soon &#173;after the initial HIV infection may be associated with a greater chance of immune reconstitution to normal or near-&#173;normal CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> lymphocyte levels. The goals of ART include durable suppression of HIV viral load to less than 50 copies/mL, restoration of immune function (as indicated by the CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> lymphocyte count), prevention of HIV transmission, prevention of drug re&#173;sis&#173;tance, and improvement in quality of life. ART regimens for treatment-&#173;naive patients are composed of a “base” medi&#173;cation and a “backbone” regimen. The base is &#173;either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor (PI). The backbone typically consists of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Treatment is based on adverse-&#173;effect profiles, comorbidities, potential drug interactions, results of drug re&#173;sis&#173;tance testing, virologic efficacy, allergy history, pregnancy status, pill burden, and dosing frequency.</p>
			<p class="body-text">ART has been shown to dramatically reduce the HIV viral load, increase CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> lymphocyte counts, delay disease progression, reduce the number of opportunistic infections, decrease the number of hospital admissions, and prolong survival. Some statistics show up to an 82% decline in the number of opportunistic infections in patients on ART. &#173;These advantages translate into improved survival and enhanced quality of life for HIV-&#173;infected patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A small percentage of the population appears to be naturally immune to HIV infection. &#173;These persons have defective genes for CCR5, a surface receptor that HIV requires to attach to T lymphocytes. Also, approximately 50% of long-&#173;term survivors of HIV infection are heterozygous for the CCR5 defect. This finding has led to speculation concerning the possibilities for ge&#173;ne&#173;tic therapy, in which anti-&#173;HIV genes could be “injected” into a patient’s chromosomes with a harmless viral vector.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pre-&#173;exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir-&#173;emtricitabine can be considered in high-&#173;risk individuals. When taken consistently, and when used in combination with condoms and other preventive methods, PrEP can reduce the risk of HIV infection in high-&#173;risk patients. For post-&#173;exposure prophylaxis (PEP), ART is taken within 72 hours &#173;after pos&#173;si&#173;ble exposure to HIV. Efforts continue to develop a safe and effective HIV vaccine.</p>

			<p class="h2">Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some patients starting ART develop new or worsening opportunistic infections or malignancies despite improvements in the clinical markers of HIV infection. &#173;These examples of paradoxical clinical worsening, known as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), occur in patients with previous opportunistic infections or low CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> T-&#173;lymphocyte levels. IRIS results from an inflammatory response to reemergence of the immune system’s ability to recognize pathogens or from tumor antigens that &#173;were previously pres&#173;ent but asymptomatic. With the increased availability of ART, more cases and more new forms of IRIS are likely to be recognized. Immune recovery uveitis (IRU) occurs in nearly 10% of HIV-&#173;infected patients with immune recovery and a history of CMV retinitis. Of &#173;these IRU patients, 46% develop significant cystoid macular edema and 49% develop epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane.</p>

			<p class="h1">Update on Antibiotics</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top23">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For more than 60&#160;years, the main trends in the management of infectious diseases have been the evolution and refinement of antibiotic therapy. &#173;Factors that have stimulated the development of new antibiotics include the continuous emergence of resistant bacteria, economics, and the desire to eliminate adverse effects. During the past 25&#160;years, emphasis has gradually shifted from aminoglycosides to <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactams and the development of new classes of antibiotics such as carbapenems and monobactams. In addition, vancomycin, TMP-&#173;SMX, erythromycin, and rifampin have enjoyed a resurgence in popularity and new applications. Quinolones offer the possibility of treating serious infections on an outpatient basis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-25">Antibacterial Agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Antibacterial agents can be separated into groups according to their specific targets on or within bacteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-28"><span class="greek--bl-">β</span>-&#173;Lactams and glycopeptides inhibit cell-&#173;wall synthesis.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Polymyxins distort cytoplasmic membrane function.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Quinolones and rifampicins inhibit nucleic acid synthesis.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Macrolides, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines inhibit ribosome function.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-29">Trimethoprim and sulfonamides inhibit folate metabolism.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">All antibiotics facilitate the growth of resistant bacteria consequent to the destruction of susceptible bacteria. Although the wide use of antimicrobial agents for veterinary and agricultural purposes has contributed to the emergence of multiresistant microorganisms, the excessive use of antibiotics, especially in hospitals, has been the most significant catalyst for re&#173;sis&#173;tance. Bacteria resist antibiotics by inactivation of the antibiotic, decreased accumulation of the antibiotic within the microorganism, or alteration of the target site on the microbe. For example, re&#173;sis&#173;tance to penicillins and cephalosporins is initiated by <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactamase enzymes that hydrolyze the <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactam ring, thus destroying the antibiotic’s effectiveness. Re&#173;sis&#173;tance can be mediated by chromosomal mutations or by the presence of extrachromosomal DNA, also known as <span class="italic">plasmid re&#173;sis&#173;tance.</span> Plasmid re&#173;sis&#173;tance is impor&#173;tant from an epidemiologic point of view &#173;because it is transmissible and usually highly stable, confers re&#173;sis&#173;tance to many dif&#173;fer&#173;ent classes of antibiotics si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously,&#160;and is often associated with other characteristics that enable a microorganism to colonize and&#160;invade a susceptible host.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Resistance-&#173;conferring plasmids have been identified in virtually all bacteria. Plasmids can pick up chromosomal genes for re&#173;sis&#173;tance and transfer them to species that are not currently resistant. Bacteria that have acquired chromosomal and plasmid-&#173;mediated re&#173;sis&#173;tance can neutralize or destroy antibiotics in 3 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ways (they can use 1 or more of &#173;these mechanisms si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-27">by preventing the antibacterial agent from reaching its receptor site</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">by modifying or duplicating the target enzyme so that it is insensitive to the antibacterial agent</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-30">by synthesizing enzymes that destroy the antibacterial agent or modify the agent to alter its entry or receptor binding</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Antimicrobial susceptibility testing permits a rational choice of antibiotics, although correlation of in vivo and in vitro susceptibility is not always precise. Disk-&#173;diffusion susceptibility testing has provided qualitative data about the inhibitory activity of commonly used antimicrobials against an isolated pathogen, and &#173;these data are usually sufficient. For serious infections, it is useful to quantify the drug concentrations that inhibit and kill the pathogen. The lowest drug concentration that prevents the growth of a defined inoculum of the isolated pathogen is the <span class="italic">minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)</span>; the lowest concentration that kills 99.9% of an inoculum is the <span class="italic">minimal lethal concentration (MLC).</span> For bactericidal drugs, the MIC and MLC are usually similar.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-31"><span class="greek_h3">β</span>-&#173;Lactam antibiotics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactam group includes the penicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams, all of which possess a <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactam ring that binds to specific microbial binding sites and interferes with cell-&#173;wall synthesis. Although the carbapenems and carbacephems are often grouped with <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactams, they have a slightly dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ring structure. Most new agents have been created by side-&#173;chain manipulation of the <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactam ring, which has improved re&#173;sis&#173;tance to enzymatic degradation. However, some of the newer antibiotics (such as third-&#173;generation cephalosporins) show diminished potency against gram-&#173;positive cocci, especially staphylococci.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-11"><span class="h4-head">Penicillins</span> The first <span class="italic">natu&#173;ral penicillins,</span> types G and V, &#173;were degraded by the enzyme penicillinase.

The next generation of penicillins included the <span class="italic">aminopenicillins,</span> ampicillin and amoxicillin, which &#173;were created by placing an amino group on the acyl side chain of the penicillin nucleus. This change broadened their effectiveness to include activity against <span class="italic">H influenzae, Escherichia coli,</span> and <span class="italic">Proteus mirabilis.</span> The next advance was development of the <span class="italic">carboxypenicillins,</span> carbenicillin and ticarcillin, which are active against aerobic gram-&#173;negative rods such as <span class="italic">P aeruginosa, Enterobacter</span> species, and indole-&#173;positive strains of <span class="italic">Proteus.</span> The fourth-&#173;generation penicillins, known as <span class="italic">acyl ureidopenicillins,</span> include azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin. &#173;Because of the possibility of emergence of re&#173;sis&#173;tance, the newer penicillins are usually administered in combination with an aminoglycoside.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Allergic reactions are the chief adverse effects encountered in using the penicillins. Among antimicrobial agents, the penicillins are the leading cause of allergy; symptoms range from mild rashes to anaphylaxis.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Vancomycin</span> has regained popularity &#173;because of the emergence of methicillin-&#173;resistant staphylococci and the recognition that <span class="italic">C difficile</span> is a cause of pseudomembranous colitis. This drug has excellent activity against <span class="italic">Clostridium</span> and against most gram-&#173;positive bacteria, including methicillin-&#173;resistant staphylococci, <span class="italic">Corynebacterium</span> species, and other diphtheroids. Vancomycin has been used alone to treat serious infections caused by methicillin-&#173;resistant staphylococci.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vancomycin-&#173;resistant enterococcal infections have recently become more common. The CDC has issued recommendations regarding appropriate use of vancomycin to help counteract the prob&#173;lem of bacterial drug re&#173;sis&#173;tance.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Teicoplanin</span> has several advantages over vancomycin, including longer half-&#173;life, lower nephrotoxicity, and no requirement for monitoring drug levels. Teicoplanin is effective for treatment of staphylococcal infections, including endocarditis, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. Teicoplanin may be preferable to vancomycin for surgical prophylaxis &#173;because of its excellent tissue penetration, lower toxicity, and long half-&#173;life, allowing single-&#173;dose administration in several surgical procedures. The antibacterial activity of teicoplanin is similar to that of vancomycin but with increased potency, particularly against <span class="italic">Streptococcus</span> and <span class="italic">Enterococcus.</span> Teicoplanin is active against many vancomycin-&#173;resistant organisms.

			<p class="h3">Quinolones</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The introduction of a fluorine into the basic quinolone nucleus of nalidixic acid has produced compounds known as <span class="italic">fluoroquinolones,</span> which have excellent activity against gram-&#173;positive bacteria. The subsequent addition of piperazine produced compounds such as norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, which have a broad spectrum of activity, encompassing staphylococci and most of the significant gram-&#173;negative bacilli, including <span class="italic">Pseudomonas.</span> Ciprofloxacin is available in both oral and parenteral forms and can be used to treat urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, and diarrheal diseases, as well as respiratory, skin, and bone infections. Other fluoroquinolones in the US market include ofloxacin, temafloxacin, lomefloxacin, enoxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and besifloxacin.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The newer fluoroquinolones possess even greater activity against gram-&#173;positive and gram-&#173;negative bacteria. &#173;Either moxifloxacin or levofloxacin appears to be a good treatment choice for pneumococcal infections that are resistant to penicillin and the macrolides. Oral quinolones are an alternative form of therapy to <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactams and aminoglycosides and have &#173;allowed physicians to treat more patients outside the hospital setting. Reported adverse &#173;effects include tendon rupture (especially in el&#173;derly patients), ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, and peripheral neuropathy. Of the quinolones, moxifloxacin carries the highest risk of dysglycemia.</p>

			<p class="h3">Macrolides</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The macrolide <span class="italic">erythromycin</span> is often employed for the initial treatment of community-&#173;acquired pneumonia. This agent is effective against infections caused by pneumococci, group A streptococci, <span class="italic">M pneumoniae, Chlamydia,</span> and <span class="italic">Legionella.</span> Erythromycin is used to treat upper respiratory tract infections and sexually transmitted infections in patients who are allergic to penicillin.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Clarithromycin</span> and <span class="italic">azithromycin</span> are macrolide antibiotics that are chemically related to erythromycin. Both are well-&#173;tolerated alternatives to erythromycin and may offer advantages in treating gonococcal and chlamydial infections and in treating <span class="italic">Mycobacterium avium</span> and other recalcitrant infections associated with AIDS and HIV infection. Clarithromycin and ethambutol are used to treat Mycobacterium avium-&#173;intracellulare complex (MAC) in an HIV-&#173;infected patient, and prophylactic therapy with azithromycin, clarithromycin, rifabutin, or combined therapy may help prevent disseminated MAC in AIDS patients. Azithromycin is subclassified as an <span class="italic">azalide,</span> and it &#173;causes far fewer drug interactions than erythromycin. &#173;There is increasing cross-&#173;resistance among the macrolides.</p>

Its major adverse effect is diarrhea, which may pro&#173;gress to pseudomembranous enterocolitis in some patients.

			<p class="h3">Aminoglycosides</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The aminoglycoside antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis by binding to bacterial ribosomes. Gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, kanamycin, streptomycin, and netilmicin possess similar activity, pharmacology, and toxicity. &#173;Because of poor gastrointestinal absorption, parenteral administration is necessary to produce therapeutic levels.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aminoglycosides are used to treat serious infections caused by gram-&#173;negative bacilli. They do not cross the blood–&#173;brain barrier. Aminoglycosides are not used for most gram-&#173;positive infections &#173;because the <span class="greek--tx-">β</span>-&#173;lactams are less toxic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The major adverse effects of the aminoglycosides are nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and aminoglycoside peak and trough serum levels should be monitored, especially in patients with known renal disease. Combined administration of a loop diuretic such as furosemide with aminoglycosides has a synergistic ototoxic effect, potentially leading to permanent loss of cochlear function. Penicillins may decrease the antimicrobial effectiveness of parenteral aminoglycosides, particularly in patients with impaired renal function.</p>

			<p class="h3">Tetracyclines</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The tetracyclines are bacteriostatic agents that reversibly inhibit ribosomal protein synthesis. Although they are active against a wide range of organisms (including <span class="italic">Staphylococcus, Rickettsia, Chlamydia, Nocardia,</span> and <span class="italic">Actinomyces</span>), re&#173;sis&#173;tance is widespread, especially among <span class="italic">S aureus</span> and gram-&#173;negative bacilli. The principal clinical uses of tetracyclines are in the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, chronic bronchitis, and sebaceous disorders such as acne rosacea. In addition, tetracyclines are an alternative for the penicillin-&#173;allergic patient with syphilis. Tetracyclines are well absorbed when taken on an empty stomach; however, their absorption is decreased when taken with milk, antacids, calcium, or iron. Tetracyclines are distributed throughout the extracellular fluid, but cerebrospinal fluid penetration is unreliable. Adverse effects include oral or vaginal candidiasis with prolonged use, gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity, elevation of the blood urea nitrogen level, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Tetracyclines can prolong the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients taking warfarin, and they should not be administered to pregnant &#173;women or to &#173;children younger than 10&#160;years &#173;because of the potential for harm to developing bone and teeth.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Miscellaneous antibacterial agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Rifampin</span> was originally developed as an anti-&#173;TB agent, but it is also used to treat several intractable bacterial infections. The drug is usually employed adjunctively &#173;because bacteria develop re&#173;sis&#173;tance to the drug when it is used as a single agent. It is effective in eradicating the carrier state of nasal <span class="italic">S aureus.</span> The drug is also effective prophylactically against <span class="italic">Neisseria meningitidis</span> and may be useful for treating oropharyngeal carriers of <span class="italic">H influenzae</span> type b.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another oral antibiotic with potential for treating deep-&#173;seated infections is TMP-&#173;SMX. &#173;After a single oral dose, the mean serum levels of TMP-&#173;SMX are approximately 75% of the concentration that would be achieved via intravenous administration. In addition to its excellent pharmacokinetics, TMP-&#173;SMX has an extremely broad spectrum of activity, including effectiveness against Enterobacteriaceae and some organisms that are resistant to cephalosporins. Although &#173;there is a misconception that TMP-&#173;SMX has limited activity against gram-&#173;positive bacteria, in fact, most streptococci, staphylococci, and <span class="italic">Listeria monocytogenes</span> are susceptible to it. Beyond the broad-&#173;spectrum effect of TMP-&#173;SMX, the concomitant use of metronidazole creates an antibiotic combination with activity against microorganisms that surpasses that of a third-&#173;generation cephalosporin. TMP-&#173;SMX has been increasingly used in the treatment and prophylaxis of <span class="italic">Pneumocystis</span> infection and toxoplasmosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Chloramphenicol</span> is a bacteriostatic agent that reversibly inhibits ribosomal protein synthesis. This drug is active against a wide variety of gram-&#173;negative and gram-&#173;positive organisms, including anaerobes. The major concern with this agent is hematopoietic toxicity, including reversible bone marrow suppression and irreversible aplasia. Aplastic anemia is an idiosyncratic late reaction to the drug and is usually fatal. Other adverse effects include hemolysis, allergy, and peripheral neuritis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">&#173;Future Directions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The World Health Organ&#173;ization (WHO) recently released a list that prioritizes antibiotic-&#173;resistant pathogens in order to guide research and development of new antimicrobial agents. The WHO’s review determined that the antibiotics currently &#173;under development are insufficient to mitigate the threat of antibiotic re&#173;sis&#173;tance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The WHO assigned the highest global priority for research and development of treatment of tuberculosis. The critical priority pathogens are carbapenem-&#173;resistant <span class="italic">Acinetobacter baumannii</span>, <span class="italic">P aeruginosa,</span> and Enterobacteriaceae. The high-&#173;priority pathogens include <span class="italic">Enterococcus faecium, S Aureus, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter, Salmonella,</span> and <span class="italic">Neisseria gonorrhoeae.</span> Medium priority has been assigned <span class="italic">to S pneumoniae, H influenzae,</span> and <span class="italic">Shigella.

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Antifungal Agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Imidazoles and triazoles function by inhibiting fungal cytochrome P-450–&#173;dependent enzymes, thereby blocking synthesis of the fungal cell membrane. The triazoles (fluconazole, itraconazole) offer a less-&#173;toxic alternative to amphotericin B for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis and other invasive fungal diseases, and they may also play a role in the long-&#173;term suppression of <span class="italic">Cryptococcus</span> &#173;after remission of acute infection in severely immunocompromised patients. Ketoconazole is often less effective than the newer triazoles and carries a higher risk of hepatotoxicity. Voriconazole, a second-&#173;generation triazole, is available in both intravenous and oral formulations. It offers a better treatment option for invasive aspergillosis and other serious fungal infections. For more on antifungal agents, see <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;14-3</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of serious, deep-&#173;seated, systemic fungal infections may require the use of intravenous amphotericin B, sometimes in combination with &#173;either flucytosine or a triazole. Lipid complex and liposome-&#173;encapsulated formulations of amphotericin B are available to reduce the drug’s toxicity. Nystatin, which is structurally similar to amphotericin B, is an antifungal agent administered topically, vaginally, or by mouth. <span class="italic">Terbinafine,</span> an allylamine oral antifungal agent, and <span class="italic">butenafine,</span> a benzylamine, are effective in controlling onychomycosis due to chronic dermatophyte infections.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Acyclovir</span> is a nucleoside analogue that is effective against HSV and VZV infections. It inhibits viral DNA replication. One phosphorylation step of acyclovir is catalyzed by the enzyme thymidine kinase. The virus-&#173;induced thymidine kinase is far more active than the host cell thymidine kinase. Therefore, acyclovir is very active against viruses within infected host cells and yet is generally well tolerated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Acyclovir has proved effective in treating a variety of herpetic infections. Oral acyclovir effectively treats acute severe genital herpes and can be used for long-&#173;term suppression in immunocompetent patients with frequently recurring genital herpes. Intravenous acyclovir is effective against herpes simplex encephalitis. Acyclovir in doses of 500&#160;mg/M<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> &#173;every 8 hours has been used successfully in treating herpes zoster infections in immunocompromised patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Oral acyclovir may be used to treat herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Doses of 800&#160;mg 5&#160;times daily are usually effective in reducing the incidence of ocular complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. However, postherpetic neuralgia is not affected by this therapy. A randomized controlled study of acyclovir and oral corticosteroids demonstrated that the latter did not help to reduce the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia when added to oral acyclovir.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Famciclovir</span> and <span class="italic">valacyclovir</span> are approved in the United States for the treatment of herpes zoster and herpes simplex infections, and studies have shown that they are effective against the latter. Both of &#173;these newer drugs allow less frequent dosing intervals (&#173;every 8–12 hours, depending on the indication). <span class="italic">Valganciclovir</span> is used for the prevention and treatment of CMV infections in patients who have under&#173;gone organ transplantation or who have AIDS, and it has also been found to be effective for treating acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis caused by VZV.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Adefovir</span> is a nucleoside analogue and a potent inhibitor of many viruses, such as HIV, HSV, hepatitis B, HPV, and EBV.

The efficacy of brivudine has been documented in several clinical &#173;trials in patients with herpesvirus-&#173;related infections, particularly herpes zoster and herpes simplex infections.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir are additional antiviral agents used for treating CMV infections, including retinitis.
