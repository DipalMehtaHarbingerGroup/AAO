			<div id="Chapt16_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Though only occasionally called on to manage a medical emergency, the ophthalmologist must be aware of the diagnostic and therapeutic steps necessary for proper care of a patient in acute distress. Infrequent use of &#173;these life-&#173;support techniques makes periodic review particularly impor&#173;tant. Also, it is advisable for a member of the office staff to be trained in basic life support. Both the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association offer courses in basic life support (BLS), advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), and pediatric advanced life support (PALS). In addition to a review of life-&#173;support techniques, it is appropriate to periodically review office procedures, medi&#173;cations, and the equipment needed for each category of medical emergency.</p>

			<p class="h1">Cardiopulmonary Arrest</p>
			<div id="Chapt16_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is intended to rescue patients with acute circulatory failure, respiratory failure, or both. The most impor&#173;tant determinant of short-&#173;term and long-&#173;term neurologically intact survival is the interval from onset of the arrest to&#160;restoration of effective spontaneous circulatory and respiratory function. Numerous studies have shown that early defibrillation is the most impor&#173;tant &#173;factor influencing survival and the minimization of sequelae. The sequences included &#173;here have been developed to optimize treatment. They are useful guidelines for most patients but do not preclude other mea&#173;sures that may be indicated for individual patients. The most crucial aspects of treatment are contained in the mnemonic <span class="italic">CAB</span>—&#173;chest compressions, airway maintenance, and breathing. The most recent published CPR protocols are the 2015 (updated in 2018) American Heart Association Guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency&#160;cardiovascu&#173;&#173;lar care; &#173;these basic CPR steps for adults, &#173;children, and infants can be found online&#160;at <a href="https://eccguidelines.heart.org/index.php/circulation/cpr-ecc-guidelines-2/">https://eccguidelines.heart.org/index.php/circulation/cpr-ecc-guidelines-2/</a>, along with extensive resources, including text, graphics, and video demonstrations of CPR techniques.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following are steps for CPR using CAB; they are performed with an unconscious patient (<span class="xref-figure">&#173;Table&#160;16-1, Video 16-1</span>):</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first--dd- ParaOverride-3">&#9;1.&#9;Determine the level of responsiveness. Attempt to arouse the patient by tapping on his or her shoulder and shouting, “Are you all right?” Do not shake the head or neck &#173;until this area has been evaluated for trauma. Quickly note if breathing is absent or abnormal (eg, gasping).</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid--dd-">&#9;2.&#9;Activate the Emergency Medical Ser&#173;vices (EMS) system if &#173;there is no patient response (in the United States, call 911 where available). Rescuers should “phone first” for unresponsive adults and give the location and nature of the emergency.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid--dd-">&#9;3.&#9;Retrieve an automated external defibrillator (AED) or send someone for the AED.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid--dd-">&#9;4.&#9;Position the victim supine on a firm, flat surface.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid--dd-">&#9;5.&#9;In an unresponsive patient without respirations, initiate chest compressions. (Determination of a pulse is no longer indicated.) Place the heel of 1 hand at the midsternal region, with the bottom of the hand 1–2 finger-&#173;breadths above the xiphoid pro&#173;cess.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid--dd-">&#9;6.&#9;“Push hard and push fast.” The recommended cardiac compression rate is at least 100 compressions per minute (100–120/min). The depth of chest compression is critical; optimal compression depths are 1.5 inches in infants (⅓ of body depth), 2.0 inches in &#173;children (⅓ of body depth), and at least 2.0 inches in adults. The chest must be allowed to fully recoil between compressions; therefore, leaning on the chest between compressions should be avoided.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid--dd-">&#9;7.&#9;Deliver 30 chest compressions.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid--dd-">&#9;8.&#9;As soon as the AED is available, the unit should be connected to the patient and instructions followed for assessing the heart rhythm. Interruptions to chest compressions should be minimized by having a second rescuer (eg, the person who retrieved the AED) charge and apply the AED. Resume chest compressions immediately &#173;after the shock and continue &#173;until 30 compressions are given.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid--dd-">&#9;9.&#9;Open the airway. Rescue breathing (see step 10 for technique) should be performed at a rate of 10–12 ventilations per minute. Use the head-&#173;tilt, chin-&#173;lift maneuver to provide a good airway. This is done by applying firm pressure to the forehead while placing the fin&#173;gers of the other hand &#173;under the chin, supporting the mandible. If a neck injury is suspected, the modified jaw thrust without head extension should be used.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid--dd-">&#9;10.&#9;Pinch the nose closed. Cover the patient’s mouth with yours, making a tight seal, and ventilate twice with full breaths (1 second each). A 2-&#173;second pause should be observed between breaths. Vis&#173;i&#173;ble chest rise should be seen with each breath. Resume chest compressions immediately. The “Help” button on the AED can be pressed for guidance with both compression and rescue breathing frequency.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid--dd-">&#9;11.&#9;For 1-&#173; and 2-&#173;rescuer CPR: When the victim’s airway is unprotected, 30 compressions should be performed before the victim is ventilated twice. About 4 seconds should be taken for 2 ventilations, including the pause between ventilations.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid--dd-">&#9;12.&#9;If 2 rescuers are pres&#173;ent, chest compression duties should be switched &#173;every <br />2 minutes or 5 compression/ventilation cycles.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last--dd- ParaOverride-4">&#9;13.&#9;Continue with compression/ventilation cycles &#173;until EMS arrives.</p>

			<p class="body-text">CPR is most effective when started immediately &#173;after cardiac arrest. If cardiac arrest has persisted for more than 10 minutes, CPR is unlikely to restore the patient’s central ner&#173;vous system (CNS) to prearrest status. If &#173;there is any question about the exact duration of cardiac arrest, the patient should be given the benefit of the doubt and resuscitation should be started.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The risk of disease transmission through mouth-&#173;to-&#173;mouth ventilation is very low, but a variety of face shields and masks are available for the health care professional. Masks are more effective than face shields in delivering adequate ventilation. Alternative airway devices (eg, a laryngeal mask airway or a esophageal/tracheal dual lumen airway device) may also be acceptable for rescuers trained in their use.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with suspected stroke should be rapidly transported to a hospital capable of&#160;initiating fibrinolytic therapy within 1 hour of arrival and within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms. &#173;These patients merit the same priorities for dispatch as patients with acute myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction or major trauma. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>&#160;in this volume for further discussion of stroke.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following adjuncts are helpful in CPR and are suggested components for a medical emergency tray or crash cart:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-7">oxygen, to enhance tissue oxygenation and to prevent or ameliorate a hypoxic state</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">airways, adult and child, oral and nasal, to be used on unconscious or sedated patients</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">a barrier device, such as a face shield or mask-&#173;to-&#173;mouth unit, to prevent disease transmission. Both can be used with supplemental oxygen and are especially useful if the rescuer is inexperienced in using a standard bag-&#173;valve device, which should also be included as standard equipment to help secure the airway.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Intravenous (IV) drugs (for use by &#173;those with ACLS training)</li>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If &#173;there is no&#160;911 community emergency phone system, it is essential to have the phone number of the local paramedic emergency squad posted near all office telephones.</p>
			<p class="body-text">BLS also outlines methods for aiding persons who are choking. &#173;These methods include the Heimlich maneuver and appropriate manual techniques for removing foreign bodies from the oral pharynx. Epigastric thrusts should be attempted; up to 10–12 thrusts may be necessary. If &#173;these techniques fail to restore effective respiratory function, ventilation should be attempted. Using a fin&#173;ger sweep to clear a foreign body from the oral pharynx is recommended by the American Medical Association but is not indicated in many modern protocols. Transtracheal ventilation by means of cricothyrotomy may be necessary if other techniques fail to clear the airway.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The American Heart Association has established guidelines and procedures for ACLS. ACLS includes intubations, defibrillation, cardioversion, pacemaker placement, administration of drugs and fluids, and communication with ambulance and hospital systems. &#173;Because of the comprehensive and changing nature of ACLS algorithms, &#173;these procedures are beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Competency in pediatric emergency care may be enhanced with training in pediatric life support (PLS) and PALS. In addition, ophthalmologists should be familiar with the ophthalmic manifestations of child abuse and abusive head trauma (shaken baby syndrome). &#173;These are discussed in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span></p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Syncope</p>
			<div id="Chapt16_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vasovagal episodes (syncope) are common, usually benign, events. &#173;These reactions are centered around the “fight or flight” response, such as when a person experiences a perceived or &#173;actual danger or threat. Common scenarios that can trigger a vasovagal attack in an ophthalmology office include dilation, applanation tonometry, contact lens insertion, and foreign body removal. Often, the patient has premonitory signs and symptoms before the episode; &#173;these include lightheadedness, nausea, the sensation of changes in temperature, or tinnitus. Physiologically, during an episode the vagus nerve is stimulated, causing peripheral blood vessels to dilate, which lowers blood pressure and slows the heart rate. Ce&#173;re&#173;bral hypoperfusion and subsequent loss of consciousness can occur. Fortunately, &#173;these episodes are short-&#173;lived; the patient typically recovers within seconds. If &#173;these episodes occur in older persons, cardiac abnormalities should be considered. Patients with a history of cardiac prob&#173;lems who experience a syncopal episode have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality and should be evaluated thoroughly. A person experiencing a syncopal episode should be placed supine—&#173;preferably in a cool, quiet place—&#173;and the legs should be elevated.</p>

			<p class="h1">Hypoglycemia</p>
			<div id="Chapt16_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ophthalmologists treat patients with diabetes mellitus daily and therefore should be familiar with the management of a hypoglycemic episode. &#173;There are 2 types of hypoglycemia: postprandial hypoglycemia and fasting hypoglycemia. &#173;Causes of hypoglycemia are varied but include diabetes mellitus treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues; adrenal insufficiency; the presence of pheochromocytoma; hyperthyroidism; substance abuse, including alcohol, cocaine, and salicylate toxicity; nutritional deficiency; eating disorders; liver disease such as cirrhosis; and medi&#173;cations such as insulin, insulin secretagogues, methadone, and tramadol. Symptoms include perspiration, tremor, tachycardia, anxiety, hunger, dizziness, changes in vision, confusion, convulsions, and syncope. Management of &#173;these episodes depends on the severity of the hypoglycemia. It is impor&#173;tant to recognize the signs of hypoglycemia; if pos&#173;si&#173;ble, blood glucose should be tested, but treatment should not be delayed. Mild to moderate hypoglycemia can be treated orally with glucose gel or tablets, fruit juice, regular soda, milk, honey or corn syrup, and crackers. Unconscious patients with severe hypoglycemia should be treated with intravenous dextrose and intramuscular glucagon.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Shock</p>
			<div id="Chapt16_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Shock is a state of tissue hypoperfusion that leads to impaired cellular metabolism and—if uncorrected—&#173;progresses to multiple organ failure and death.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Classification</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Shock is classified according to the 4 primary pathophysiologic mechanisms involved:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-12">oligemic, or hypovolemic (eg, hemorrhage, diabetic ketoacidosis, burns, or sequestration)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">cardiogenic (eg, myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction or arrhythmia)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">obstructive (eg, pericardial tamponade, pulmonary embolus, or tension pneumothorax)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-13">distributive, characterized by maldistribution of the vascular volume secondary to altered vasomotor tone (eg, sepsis, anaphylaxis, spinal cord insult, beriberi, or arteriovenous fistula)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The type of shock can often be determined by the history, physical examination, and &#173;appropriate diagnostic tests. Regardless of the event that precipitated the state of shock, microcirculatory failure is the common &#173;factor that eventually leads to death in individuals in advanced shock. Ventilatory failure appears to be the most significant &#173;factor in the morbidity and mortality of shock, with subsequent hypoxemia and metabolic acidosis leading to many complications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If vasovagal syncope is ruled out (due to its short duration and &#173;because of familiarity with the situations that produce this condition), the basic life-&#173;support mea&#173;sures for the initial emergency care of the unconscious patient are similar to the mea&#173;sures used when treating patients with shock. The most impor&#173;tant aspects of treatment are the CABs, the same princi&#173;ples used in CPR (see the section Cardiopulmonary Arrest earlier in this chapter).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Failure of respiratory gas exchange is the most frequent single cause of death in patients with shock; thus, respiratory obstruction must be ruled out first. Oxygen is then given by mask; if respiratory movements are shallow, mechanical ventilation is necessary. Respiratory obstruction can be assumed if &#173;there is stridor with respiratory movements or if cyanosis persists even when adequate ventilatory techniques have been applied. A conscious patient in distress who cannot speak and who is developing cyanosis may be choking on food or a foreign body.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Assessment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The patient’s vital signs must be monitored. The clinical syndrome is usually characterized by an altered sensorium, relative hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, oliguria, metabolic acidosis, weak or absent pulse, pallor, diaphoresis, and cool skin (however, in cases of septic shock the skin may be warm). Decreased pulse pressure is often an early sign of shock, and systolic blood pressures of less than 90&#160;mm Hg are often associated with vital organ hypoperfusion. Blood pressure is not always a reliable indicator of tissue perfusion, however.</p>
			<p class="h2">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Specific guidelines for the treatment of shock, which is often quite complex, are beyond the scope of this text. General guidelines are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">The EMS system should be activated, or the patient should be transferred to an emergency department.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The patient should be positioned supine, with the legs elevated.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Supplemental oxygen should be administered to enhance tissue oxygenation. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary to maintain the <span class="caps">P</span>o<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> at normal levels and to prevent respiratory acidosis.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Fluid resuscitation with IV infusion of a crystalloid solution (ie, normal saline or Ringer’s lactate) should be administered rapidly.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Vasopressor drugs (norepinephrine first) may be necessary for augmentation of systemic vascular tone and/or cardiac output to help perfuse vital organs &#173;after an adequate circulating volume is established. Vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone (ADH), has been suggested for septic shock &#173;because of its potent vasoconstrictor effect but it should only be reserved for salvage therapy. In December&#160;2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved synthetic &#173;human angiotensin II (Giapreza) for adults with septic or other distributive shock.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">If sepsis is suspected, blood cultures should be drawn and antibiotic therapy initiated promptly.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">Sodium bicarbonate, given intravenously, is indicated for correction of severe &#173;metabolic acidosis.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Experimental drugs used in the treatment of septic shock include polyclonal IV immunoglobulin, &#173;because it can bind endotoxin, but no existing studies substantiate its use.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Anaphylaxis</span> is an acute allergic reaction following antigen exposure in a previously sensitized person; it requires immediate and specific therapy. It is usually mediated by immunoglobulin E antibodies and involves release of chemical mediators from mast cells and basophils. <span class="italic">Anaphylactoid reactions,</span> which are more common and less severe, are triggered by nonantigenic agents and are the result of direct release of &#173;these chemical mediators. Anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions may occur &#173;after exposure to pollen, drugs, foreign serum, insect stings, diagnostic agents such as iodinated contrast materials or fluorescein, vaccines, local anesthetics, and food products. The most impor&#173;tant pa&#173;ram&#173;e&#173;ter for predicting such an attack is a history of a previous allergic reaction to any other drug or pos&#173;si&#173;ble antigen. Unfortunately, a history of known sensitivity may not always be elicited. Studies indicate that the prevalence of anaphylaxis has been increasing steadily since 2008.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anaphylaxis is particularly impor&#173;tant to the ophthalmologist, in view of the increasing number of surgical procedures and fluorescein angiograms performed in the office setting. It is estimated that allergic reactions to fluorescein (including urticaria) occur in up to 1% of all angiograms. In 1 survey, the overall risk of a severe reaction was 1&#160;in 1900 patients, including a risk of respiratory compromise in 1&#160;in 3800 subjects. If diaphoresis, apprehension, pallor, a rapid and weak pulse, or any combination thereof develops in a patient &#173;after administration of a drug, the patient should be considered to have an allergic reaction &#173;until proven other&#173;wise. The diagnosis is confirmed if the patient experiences associated generalized itching, urticaria, angioedema of the skin, dyspnea, wheezing, or arrhythmia. Anaphylaxis may rapidly lead to loss of consciousness, shock, cardiac arrest, coma, or death.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once an acute allergic reaction is suspected, prompt treatment is indicated:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Oxygen should be administered to patients in respiratory distress.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Epinephrine (0.3&#160;mL of a 1:1000 solution) injected intramuscularly in a limb opposite to the antigenic agent exposure site is usually effective for the maintenance of circulation and blood pressure.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">IV volume expansion may be necessary to restore and maintain tissue perfusion. Methylprednisolone should be administered for serious or prolonged reactions. When given early, corticosteroids help control pos&#173;si&#173;ble long-&#173;term sequelae.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Antihistamines are helpful in slowing or halting the ongoing allergic response but are of limited value in acute anaphylaxis.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Tracheotomy or cricothyrotomy is indicated when laryngeal edema is unresponsive to the previous methods or when oral intubation cannot be performed.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">All patients with anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions should be kept &#173;under observation for at least 6 hours.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In cases of mild allergic reactions, the physician can administer 25–50&#160;mg of diphenhydramine hydrochloride orally or intramuscularly and observe the patient closely to determine &#173;whether further treatment is necessary. Pretreating high-&#173;risk patients with an antihistamine, corticosteroids, or both prior to fluorescein angiography may reduce the risk of an allergic reaction. In all cases of anaphylaxis, supportive treatment should be maintained &#173;until the emergency medical team arrives.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For patients with a known history of anaphylaxis, personal emergency kits containing epinephrine are available and can be used &#173;until medical help arrives. The kits are designed to allow self-&#173;treatment by the patient or administration by a &#173;family member or an informed bystander. One commercially available allergy kit contains a syringe and needle preloaded with 0.6&#160;mL of 1:1000 epinephrine. The physician who prescribes this kit must give detailed instructions concerning the use of the device. Epinephrine auto-&#173;injectors are also available. Each contains a spring-&#173;loaded automatic injector, which does not permit graduated doses to be given but automatically injects 0.3&#160;mg of epinephrine (0.15&#160;mg in the pediatric version) when the device is triggered by pressure on the thigh. The epinephrine ampules contained in &#173;these self-&#173;treatment kits have a limited shelf life and should be replaced when the expiration date is reached or if the solution becomes discolored. Any person given epinephrine requires 4–6 hours of observation to ensure that &#173;there is no rebound effect. In recent years, &#173;there has been renewed interest in treatment of allergic reactions with sublingual immunotherapy, in which the patient is exposed to the offending antigen via the gastrointestinal system to improve tolerance.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-16">Seizures and Status Epilepticus</p>
			<div id="Chapt16_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A <span class="italic">seizure</span> is a paroxysmal episode of abnormal electrical activity in the brain, resulting in involuntary transient neurologic, motor activity, behavioral, or autonomic dysfunction. Typically, seizures are divided into 2 major categories, partial and generalized. Although seizures can pres&#173;ent with many dif&#173;fer&#173;ent clinical manifestations, most fit into the subcategories of &#173;simple partial, complex partial, or generalized tonic–&#173;clonic. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span> for detailed discussion of &#173;these categories.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Status epilepticus</span> is defined as a prolonged seizure (30 minutes or longer) or as multiple seizures without intervening periods of normal consciousness. Like seizures, status epilepticus may have a local onset with secondary generalization or may be generalized from onset. This condition often occurs concomitantly with hyperthermia, acidosis, hypoxia, tachycardia, hypercapnia, and mydriasis and, if per&#173;sis&#173;tent, may be associated with irreversible brain injury. Status epilepticus that is completely stopped within 2 hours usually has relatively minor morbidity compared with episodes lasting longer than 2 hours.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Major &#173;causes of seizures and status epilepticus include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">drug withdrawal, such as from anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or alcohol</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">metabolic abnormalities, such as hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, or hypomagnesemia</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">conditions that affect the CNS, such as infection, trauma, stroke, hypoxia, ischemia, or sleep deprivation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">toxic levels of vari&#173;ous drugs</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Emergency <span class="italic">medical</span> management of seizures is best left to physicians who perform this routinely. However, the clinician should be aware of some general considerations in the treatment of seizures. The first priority is now the maintenance of circulation as opposed to airway maintenance. Maintenance of circulation becomes particularly impor&#173;tant if the seizure progresses to status epilepticus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">During seizure management, it is impor&#173;tant not only to stop the seizure activity but also to identify and treat the under&#173;lying cause when pos&#173;si&#173;ble. Additional steps include noting the time of seizure onset, monitoring and maintaining an airway, and monitoring vital signs. Activation of the emergency response (911) team is indicated in all cases of acute seizure onset. In the setting of an ophthalmology office, it may be appropriate to check blood glucose levels, &#173;because many seizure patients have diabetes mellitus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Refractory cases of status epilepticus have responded successfully to repeated electroconvulsive therapy sessions, IV sedatives such as ketamine or propofol, surgical ablation and stimulation procedures, and topiramate and levetiracetam.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Toxic Reactions to Local Anesthetic Agents and Other Drugs</p>
			<div id="Chapt16_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Toxic overdose can cause acute distress and unconsciousness. Clinicians should be prepared to respond to this emergency whenever a patient is undergoing a procedure that requires local anesthesia. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;16-2</span> lists commonly used local anesthetics and their maximum safe dose.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Reactions following administration of local anesthetics are almost always toxic and only rarely allergic. A high blood level of local anesthetic can be produced by the following: too large a dose, unusually rapid absorption (including inadvertent administration directly into a vein), and unusually slow detoxification or elimination (especially in individuals with liver disease). Though rare, hypersensitivity (ie, decreased patient tolerance) and idiosyncratic reactions to local anesthetic agents may occur, as with any drug. True allergic or anaphylactic reactions are also uncommon but may occur, particularly with agents belonging to the amino ester class (eg, tetracaine).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Toxic reactions cause overstimulation of the CNS, which may lead to excitability, restlessness, apprehension, disorientation, tremors, and convulsions (ce&#173;re&#173;bral cortex effects), as well as nausea and vomiting (medulla effects). Cardiac effects initially include tachycardia and hypertension. Ultimately, depression of the CNS and the cardiovascular system occurs, which may result in drowsiness or coma (ce&#173;re&#173;bral cortex effects), as well as in irregular respirations, sighing, dyspnea, and respiratory arrest (medulla effects). Cardiac effects of CNS depression are bradycardia and hypotension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Injected local anesthetic can have a direct toxic effect on muscle tissue. In peribulbar or retrobulbar injections, this can result in muscle weakness, which in some patients is followed by muscle contracture. Extraocular motility can be affected, resulting in diplopia (usually hypertropia) that may require surgical revision. Hyaluronidase may be partially protective by allowing more rapid diffusion of the anesthetic agent following injection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Increased metabolic activity of the CNS and poor ventilation can lead to ce&#173;re&#173;bral hypoxia. Treatment consists of oxygenation, supportive airway care, and titrated IV administration of midazolam, which is used to suppress cortical stimulation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other emergency procedures that must be applied in cases of toxic overdose include suctioning if vomiting occurs and using a taped tongue blade if convulsions develop. If shock develops, the appropriate drugs can be administered by IV infusion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The addition of <span class="italic">epinephrine</span> to the local anesthetic can also cause adverse reactions. Reactions to epinephrine can produce symptoms similar to &#173;those of early CNS overstimulation by local anesthetic, such as anxiety, restlessness, tremor, hypertension, and tachycardia. Unlike local anesthetic toxicity, however, epinephrine overdose does not produce convulsions or bradycardia as the toxic reaction progresses. Oxygen is useful in the treatment of epinephrine overdoses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although rare, death can occur as a result of retrobulbar or peribulbar local anesthetic; for example, the administration of retrobulbar <span class="italic">bupivacaine</span> has been associated with respiratory arrest. This reaction may be caused by intra-&#173;arterial injection of the local anesthetic, with retrograde flow to the ce&#173;re&#173;bral circulation. It can also result from puncture of the dural sheath of the optic nerve during retrobulbar block, with diffusion of the local anesthetic along the subdural space in the midbrain. Initial symptoms are a gradual or sudden change in consciousness, such as coma with tonic-&#173;clonic seizures; apnea; and blood pressure lability. A large prospective study that compared retrobulbar injection of 0.75% bupivacaine plus 2.0% lidocaine to 0.75% bupivacaine plus 4.0% lidocaine found that the patients receiving 4.0% lidocaine mixed with bupivacaine had an almost 9 times greater risk of respiratory arrest than patients receiving 2.0% lidocaine mixed with bupivacaine. Ophthalmologists should be prepared for &#173;these pos&#173;si&#173;ble adverse effects by having the proper resuscitative equipment at hand and training office staff in CPR.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The use of IV <span class="italic">edrophonium chloride</span> in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis can have toxic adverse effects. The signs and symptoms result from cholinergic stimulation and may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, increased bronchial and salivary secretions, muscle fasciculations and weakness, and bradycardia. Some of &#173;these signs may be transient and self-&#173;limited &#173;because of the very short half-&#173;life of IV edrophonium. However, whenever the test is to be performed, a syringe containing 0.5&#160;mg of atropine sulfate must be immediately available. (Some physicians routinely pretreat with atropine all patients undergoing such testing.)</p>
			<p class="body-text">As noted, if signs of excess cholinergic stimulation occur, 0.5&#160;mg of atropine sulfate should be administered intravenously. This dose may be repeated &#173;every 3–10 minutes if necessary. The total dose of atropine necessary to counteract the toxic effects is seldom more than 2&#160;mg. If toxic signs pro&#173;gress, the treatment described earlier for toxic overdose may be necessary.</p>

			<p class="h2">The Opioid Crisis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The opioid crisis is a national socio&#173;economic and public health issue with which &#173;every &#173;ophthalmologist should be familiar. Opioid abuse includes misuse and addiction to prescription pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. In the United States, 115 individuals die of opioid overdose daily. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the economic burden of this crisis at $78.5 billion a year. This figure includes the cost of health care for the addicted individuals, productivity loss, addiction treatment, and the ultimate involvement of the criminal justice system in many of &#173;these cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cause of this epidemic is multifactorial; its origins can be traced back to the late 1990s when phar&#173;ma&#173;ceu&#173;ti&#173;cal companies assured the medical community that patients would not become addicted to prescription opioid pain relievers. Prescription of &#173;these medi&#173;cations to patients led to their widespread use and subsequent misuse, and it soon became clear that &#173;these drugs &#173;were indeed highly addictive. Opioid overdose rates began to increase; in 2015 alone, more than 33,000 individuals in the United States died as a result of overdose from prescription pain killers, heroin, and illegally manufactured synthetic fentanyl. Also in 2015, it was determined that approximately 2 million &#173;people &#173;were abusing pain medi&#173;cations, and over half a million &#173;people &#173;were suffering from heroin addiction, which unfortunately occurred in conjunction with prior opioid pain medi&#173;cation use in some cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Roughly 21%–29% of patients prescribed opioid-&#173;based chronic-&#173;pain medi&#173;cations &#173;ultimately abuse them. Of &#173;these, 8%–12% develop an opioid use disorder. Unfortunately, 4%–6% of &#173;those who abuse prescription opioids transition to heroin. In fact, 80.5% of individuals addicted to heroin once misused prescription pain medicine. In addition to the devastating public health issue created by this crisis, &#173;there is an increase in neonatal abstinence syndrome due to the misuse of opioids during pregnancy. Increased injection drug use has also led to increased incidence of blood-&#173;borne infections such as HIV and hepatitis C, resulting from the use of contaminated injection drug equipment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The US Department of Health and &#173;Human Ser&#173;vices and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have aggressive strategies to manage this devastating prob&#173;lem by improving access to treatment and recovery programs, promoting the use of overdose-&#173;reversing drugs, advocating for better public health surveillance, improving research on pain and addiction, and, fi&#173;nally, improving prescribing patterns in the medical community for patients experiencing pain. The NIH is also exploring formal partnerships with phar&#173;ma&#173;ceu&#173;ti&#173;cal companies and academic centers to develop safe, effective nonaddictive approaches to managing long-&#173;term pain, to develop new medi&#173;cations and technologies to treat opioid-&#173;use disorders, and to improve prevention and reversal interventions to save lives and support recovery.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-19">Ocular Adverse Effects of Systemic Medications</p>
			<div id="Chapt16_Top9">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because of the advancement of medical specialties and the proliferation of specific therapeutic agents, patients frequently have multiple simultaneous drug regimens. Often, no single physician is aware of all the drugs the patient is taking. The clinical prob&#173;lem is compounded by several &#173;factors. In addition, the physician may not be familiar with the types of drugs or the properties of drugs used outside his or her specialty. The patient may also have a drug interaction that affects a bodily system not usually monitored by the specialist. Fi&#173;nally, the patient might not associate a symptom with a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar drug if that symptom is not related to the system for which the drug was given. The growing use of electronic medical rec&#173;ords has helped physicians become more aware of the multiple drug regimens, but it has not eliminated the prob&#173;lem.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The effects of some systemic drugs are widely known. For example, the commonly prescribed erectile dysfunction agent sildenafil has been noted to block photoreceptor signals, causing electroretinographic changes, visual disturbances (including changes in color perception), and increased light sensitivity. The spectrum of systemic side effects of commonly used ophthalmic drugs is covered extensively elsewhere in this series (see BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Uveitis and Ocular Inflammation,</span> and Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma</span>). The ocular adverse effects of several commonly prescribed systemic medi&#173;cations are presented in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;16-3</span>. Drug interactions are always a concern in patients who use multiple topical and systemic medi&#173;cations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist can minimize adverse effects from multiple-&#173;drug therapy by &#173;doing the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Maintain a high level of suspicion for drug interactions.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Question the patient closely about other drug therapy and general symptoms.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Encourage all patients to carry a card listing the drugs they use.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Keep in close communication with the patient’s primary care physician.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Consult with a clinical pharmacologist or internist whenever a question of drug interaction arises.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">Utilize the resources provided through electronic medical rec&#173;ords. For example, some electronic medical rec&#173;ord systems link to pharmacy rec&#173;ords.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Unrecognized adverse effects of topical or systemic medi&#173;cations should be reported to the National Registry of Drug-&#173;Induced Ocular Side Effects, either via their website at <a href="http://www.eyedrugregistry.com">www.&#173;eyedrugregistry.&#173;com</a>, or in correspondence with the registry’s director Frederick T.
