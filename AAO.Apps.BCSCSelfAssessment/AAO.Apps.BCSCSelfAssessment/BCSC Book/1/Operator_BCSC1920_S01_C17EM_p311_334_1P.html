			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Meta-&#173;analyses offer the highest levels of evidence &#173;because they provide a methodology to analyze the data of multiple clinical &#173;trials. Case-&#173;control and cohort studies are observational studies that are useful for describing the pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion and progression of a disease, generating hypotheses, or using existing data to test hypotheses. Prospective randomized controlled double-&#173;masked studies provide better evidence regarding the effects of an intervention.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;2.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> The number needed to treat (NNT) is helpful when describing how likely a treatment or medi&#173;cation &#173;will improve an outcome for an individual patient. If the absolute risk reduction is 20%, the NNT is 5 (100/20). In other words, a clinician could describe to their patient that they would need to treat 5 patients with this theoretical treatment to prevent 1 patient from developing worsening multiple sclerosis.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;3.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> Depression is the most frequent psychiatric prob&#173;lem in the older population. Approximately one-&#173;quarter of older patients seen in primary care settings are clinically depressed. The prevalence of depression in patients with macular degeneration is even higher, at 30%–40%. Although dementia is common in persons older than 80&#160;years, dementia is not a normal part&#160;of the aging pro&#173;cess. Schizo&#173;phre&#173;nia usually begins when patients are young and continues to a greater or lesser extent throughout their lives. Bipolar disorder has an average age of onset of 25&#160;years and is found in approximately 4% of &#173;people.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;4.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> Bisphosphonates are often prescribed to postmenopausal &#173;women to inhibit bone resorption. &#173;These drugs have been associated with inflammatory disease of the eye, including conjunctivitis, uveitis, and episcleritis. Scleritis, which can be vision threatening, has also been reported.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;5.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> The lifetime risk of developing a major depressive disorder for &#173;women is 17%, which is almost twice that of men, who have a 9% risk.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;6.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> Somatic disorders (conversion disorder; illness anxiety disorders, including body dysmorphic disorder; factitious disorder) are classified in the <span class="endmatter-answers_italic">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of &#173;Mental Disorders,</span> Fifth Edition (DSM–5), as somatic symptom and related disorders. This term describes a syndrome of symptoms suggesting physical illness or injury in the absence of objective findings or a known physiological mechanism, following appropriate investigation. The prevalence of somatic disorders in the general population is around 6%. Associated risk &#173;factors are female sex, lower socioeconomic level, and minority ethnic status. In this scenario, the patient has been diagnosed with factitious disorder (previously known as Munchausen syndrome), which is characterized by the willful production, feigning, or exaggeration of physical or psychological signs or symptoms in the absence of external &#173;causes. Topical anesthetic abuse should be treated accordingly, and the patient should be referred to a psychotherapist. Although no medi&#173;cations are indicated specifically for the disorder, coexisting &#173;mental health disorders (eg, depression or substance abuse) may require prescribed psychotropic agents.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;7.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Shingrix is an effective inactivated recombinant zoster vaccine that was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 for adults aged 50 or older to reduce the incidence of varicella-&#173;zoster virus (VZV) infection. It does not contain live virus and therefore may be safe in immunocompromised patients. Varivax is a live, attenuated varicella-&#173;zoster vaccine that is recommended for immunocompetent pediatric patients older than 12 months with no history of previous infection with VZV, or for health care workers not previously exposed to varicella. Zostavax is another live, attenuated zoster vaccine that was previously recommended to reduce the risk of VZV infection and postherpetic neuralgia in adults. However, Zostavax appears to be less effective than Shingrix, and it cannot be used in adults receiving high-&#173;level immunosuppressive therapy. Neither Shingrix nor Zostavax can be used in place of Varivax in younger persons. ProQuad is a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox (also called MMRV). It contains the same live, attenuated vaccine as Varivax.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;8.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> Screening for nonresearch purposes is useful if the disease in question is detectable with some mea&#173;sur&#173;able degree of reliability, is treatable or preventable, is significant &#173;because of its impact (prevalence or severity), is progressive, and is generally asymptomatic (or has symptoms a patient might deny or might not recognize). The scenario that fits &#173;these princi&#173;ples best is the 6-&#173;year-&#173;old child who receives a vision test at school. It fits the &#173;tenets of a good screening test &#173;because childhood refractive error is common and treatable. Screening can detect amblyopia, which may other&#173;wise go undetected &#173;until development of strabismus or vision prob&#173;lems are noticed by a school teacher. In contrast, it is inappropriate for a 70-&#173;year-&#173;old &#173;woman with no ocular findings to receive antibody testing for myasthenia gravis, &#173;because it is a relatively rare disease; thus, testing for this condition should be performed only in patients with suspicious symptoms. Furthermore, the current tests are only 50% sensitive for ocular myasthenia gravis, although specificity raises its utility in a patient with signs of fatigable ptosis or incomitant strabismus. A 15-&#173;year-&#173;old sexually inactive girl does not need routine screening with a treponemal antibody syphilis test; syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection, and individuals who have not yet been sexually active are not at risk. Fi&#173;nally, the meningococcus vaccine is not a screening test; it is a preventive treatment for an acute and symptomatic disease and is required for persons applying for a visa for travel to Saudi Arabia.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;9.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Epstein-&#173;Barr virus, the causative agent in infectious mononucleosis, has been associated with Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Herpes simplex virus has been associated with carcinoma of the lip and oropharynx, as well as cancer of the uterine cervix, vulva, kidneys, and nasopharynx. Cytomegalovirus has been associated with prostate cancer, Kaposi sarcoma, and carcinoma of the bladder and uterine cervix. Hepatitis B virus has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;10.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that acts as a decoy receptor for vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF). Aflibercept inactivates VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth &#173;factor and is effective in the treatment of neovascular age-&#173;related macular degeneration. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF-A. Pegaptanib is an aptamer that specifically binds the &#173;human 165 isoform of VEGF. Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized antibody fragment that binds all active isoforms of VEGF-&#173;A.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers ParaOverride-10">&#9;11.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> The lens is the most radiosensitive structure in the eye, followed by the cornea, the ret&#173;ina, and the optic nerve. Cataract formation is the most likely complication of radiation exposure that would be found in this patient. Low doses of radiation (as low as 2&#160;Gy in 1 fraction) may cause cataract formation, and higher doses of radiation (7–8&#160;Gy and higher) can cause progressive cataracts. The average latent period for the development of radiation-&#173;induced cataracts is 2 to 3&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;&#9; In severe cases, erosion of the corneal epithelium and secondary ulceration may result. Radiation retinopathy clinically resembles diabetic retinopathy; injury occurs first to the capillary vascular endothelium, then the capillary pericytes, and then the endothelium of larger vessels, resulting in ischemic changes. Cotton-&#173;wool spots develop first, followed by capillary nonperfusion, then ingrowth of telangiectatic vessels. Radiation optic neuropathy may pre&#173;sent with optic nerve head pallor and splinter hemorrhages, but the exposure may also be clinically &#173;silent except for symptoms of unilateral headache and ocular pain.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;12.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> The clinical picture and histopathology of toxoplasmosis are a reflection of the immune response. In immunocompromised patients, reactivation of latent disease can cause life-&#173;threatening encephalitis. Primary toxoplasmosis infection is usually subclinical, but in some patients cervical lymphadenopathy or ocular disease can be pre&#173;sent. The ocular manifestations include uveitis and chorioretinitis with macular scarring.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;13.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> Primary VZV infection usually occurs in childhood in the form of chickenpox (varicella), a generalized vesicular rash accompanied by mild constitutional symptoms. Reactivation may be heralded by pain in a sensory nerve distribution, followed by a unilateral vesicular eruption occurring over 1 to 3 dermatomic areas. New crops of lesions appear in the same area within 7 days. Severe neurologic sequelae following VZV reactivation include segmental myelitis, Guillain-&#173;Barr<span class="endmatter-answers_accent">é</span> syndrome, and Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Postherpetic neuralgia may occur in up to 50% of patients older than 50&#160;years. Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome is a rare, serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes usually due to a reaction to a medi&#173;cation or an infection. Often, it begins with flulike symptoms, followed by a painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;14.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> The Ebola virus is contracted through contact with blood or bodily fluids or tissue of infected bats, nonhuman primates, or &#173;humans. Ophthalmologists working in endemic areas should suspect Ebola virus infection when patients pre&#173;sent with hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. &#173;Later ocular findings include ret&#173;i&#173;nal scarring, cataracts, and optic neuropathy. The other viruses listed do not typically pre&#173;sent with hemorrhagic conjunctivitis.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;15.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> The Universal Protocol of the Joint Commission, which is designed to eliminate wrong-&#173;site surgery, includes performing a time-&#173;out before the initiation of surgery, during which the surgical team agree that the patient who is about to undergo a surgical procedure is the correct patient, that the procedure is correct for that patient, and that the correct site is identified. This requires the confirmation of 2 unique patient identifiers that include name, date of birth, and medical rec&#173;ord number. In addition, the surgical team must agree on and document the procedure to be performed, and mark the surgical site in the preoperative period. Noting the level of fire risk, identifying the operating room staff, and confirming postoperatively that the planned procedure was completed are not part&#160;of the Universal Protocol of the Joint Commission.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;16.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Malignant hyperthermia is a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorder in which skeletal muscle exposure to a triggering agent results in hypermetabolic activity and crisis. &#173;Factors that raise suspicion for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility include a positive &#173;family history, diagnosis of certain muscle disorders (in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, &#173;those associated with ryanodine receptor mutations), or a history of unexpected exertional or heat-&#173;induced rhabdomyolysis, or severe statin-&#173;induced myopathy. Although Noonan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and myotonias &#173;were historically associated with malignant hyperthermia, they are no longer thought to impart a greater risk. A negative personal or &#173;family history of malignant hyperthermia does not raise suspicion for this disorder but neither does it rule out susceptibility. Individuals at greater risk for malignant hyperthermia may undergo muscle biopsy for muscle contracture evaluation (caffeine halothane contracture test). A negative contracture test essentially rules out MH susceptibility. A positive contracture test should be followed by confirmatory ge&#173;ne&#173;tic analy&#173;sis.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;17.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> The decision to maintain or discontinue anticoagulants/antiplatelet agents for ophthalmic surgery is contingent on the type of procedure, the bleeding risk, the effect of bleeding on postoperative outcome, and the risk of a serious or fatal thrombotic event &#173;after discontinuation. For uncomplicated cataract surgery via clear corneal incision &#173;under topical anesthesia, the benefit of discontinuing anticoagulants to prevent bleeding does not outweigh the potential risks. Studies found an increased risk of ophthalmic bleeding when warfarin was continued in patients undergoing cataract surgery, but the bleeding events &#173;were minor and did not impact vision. Continuation of aspirin or clopidogrel had similar findings. Direct-&#173;acting anticoagulants (eg, &#173;factor Xa inhibitors [apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban] and a thrombin inhibitor [dabigatran]) have a 20% lower risk than warfarin of causing intraocular bleeding during surgery. In an emergent situation, the monoclonal antibody idarucizumab can reverse the effect of dabigatran within 15 minutes. In patients on dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) &#173;after cardiac stent placement, &#173;there is increased risk of thrombosis of the stented artery, with potentially fatal outcome if &#173;these agents are discontinued. Cataract surgery may be performed in &#173;these patients when cessation of anticoagulants is felt to be unnecessary.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;18.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> The current recommendations are that fibrinolytic therapy should be initiated in a patient with suspected ischemic stroke within 3 hours of onset of symptoms and within 1&#160;hour of arrival at the hospital.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;19.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> The main products of the posterior pituitary are oxytocin and vasopressin. Growth hormone–&#173;releasing hormone, dopamine, and thyrotropin-&#173;releasing hormone are involved in anterior pituitary function.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;20.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> Medullary thyroid cancer is seen in 90%–100% of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome types 2A and 2B. Hyperparathyroidism, gastrinomas, and pituitary adenomas are commonly seen in MEN 1.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;21.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> <span class="endmatter-answers_greek">β</span>-&#173;blockers can cause bronchospasm and should thus be avoided in patients with asthma and reactive airway disease. They also cause bradycardia and should be avoided in patients with second-&#173; and third-&#173;degree atrioventricular blocks. In patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, the use of certain <span class="endmatter-answers_greek">β</span>-&#173;blockers reduces hospitalization for heart failure and improves survival rates. <span class="endmatter-answers_greek">β</span>-&#173;blockers are beneficial in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and essential tremor.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;22.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> In the simplified classification of hypertensive retinopathy, which was proposed in 2004, hypertensive retinopathy is categorized as mild, moderate, or malignant. The presence of ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage, microaneurysm, cotton-&#173;wool spot, hard exudates, or a combination of &#173;these signs indicates moderate hypertensive retinopathy, which has a strong association with stroke, cognitive decline, and death from cardiovascular &#173;causes. Moderate retinopathy plus optic nerve head edema indicates malignant hypertensive retinopathy, which is strongly associated with death. Mild hypertensive retinopathy has a modest association with risk of stroke, coronary disease, and death and is characterized by focal/generalized arteriolar narrowing, arteriovenous nicking, increased opacity of the arteriolar wall (“copper wiring”), or a combination of &#173;these signs.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;23.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> High-&#173;density lipoprotein (HDL), or “good cholesterol,” is protective against atherosclerosis. It has anti-&#173;inflammatory properties and transports cholesterol away from the blood vessel walls to the liver for disposal. Very-&#173;low-&#173;density lipoproteins (VLDLs) produced by the liver carry most circulating triglycerides. Intermediate-&#173;density lipoproteins (IDLs) are less dense than low-&#173;density lipoprotein (LDL) molecules but denser than VLDL particles; some are cleared rapidly into the liver and some are degraded to LDLs. LDL, or “bad cholesterol,” is a product of VLDL and IDL metabolism and is the primary carrier of cholesterol.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;24.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Current guidelines recommend a high HDL and low LDL concentration to decrease risk of cardiovascular disease. Lipoproteins, which transport cholesterol and triglycerides in the body, are classified based on the relative concentrations of their components. LDL is associated with atherogenesis; lowering LDL levels is associated with a reduction in risk for cardiovascular disease. In contrast, HDL has a protective effect against atherogenesis &#173;because it has anti-&#173;inflammatory properties and transports cholesterol from blood vessel walls to the liver for disposal.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;25.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran can be reversed with the monoclonal antibody idarucixumab. Warfarin has been a mainstay of anticoagulation treatment for patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, however, new classes of oral anticoagulants offer superior stroke prevention with comparable bleeding risks and without the need for regular international normalized ratio (INR) checks. Although warfarin can be reversed (historically with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K), many of the new agents are not reversible at this time, including &#173;factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban and apixaban.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;26.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> Reducing afterload by decreasing vascular re&#173;sis&#173;tance and lowering arterial blood pressure is a primary goal in the management of HFrEF. Digoxin is an inotropic agent that can be used to enhance left ventricle contractility in patients with HFrEF who are still symptomatic despite efforts to reduce afterload. Like <span class="endmatter-answers_greek">β</span>-&#173;blockers and angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, amlodipine and hydralazine both reduce afterload. Although intermittent arrhythmias can impair ventricular function in congestive heart failure (CHF), amiodarone was not effective in a clinical trial.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;27.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> Rivaroxaban is a &#173;factor Xa inhibitor that prevents the cleaving of prothrombin to thrombin. Clopidogrel prevents the activation of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and inhibits platelet aggregation. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that reduces the synthesis of numerous clotting &#173;factors that require vitamin K. Aspirin blocks cyclo-&#173;oxygenase and inhibits platelet aggregation.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;28.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> Multiple studies have shown that the administration of the fibrinolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) within a 3-&#173;hour win&#173;dow of symptom onset results in lower morbidity from ischemic strokes. Imaging with noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) is critical in evaluating for the presence of hemorrhage, which would be a contraindication to rtPA use. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than CT in detecting evolving ischemia within hours of onset, particularly if diffusion-&#173;weighted MRI (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping is used. However, MRI is too time-&#173;intensive, considering the &#173;limited win&#173;dow during which rtPA can be administered. Ce&#173;re&#173;bral angiography provides detailed information about vascular abnormalities, but it is not indicated in the acute setting and would not reveal &#173;either stroke or hemorrhage. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography may reveal stenosis of the intracranial arteries but is not helpful in making decisions regarding initial management.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;29.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> The possibility of an aneurysm at the origin of the posterior communicating artery from the internal carotid artery must be urgently evaluated in a patient presenting with a new-&#173;onset painful pupil-&#173;involving third cranial nerve palsy. Saccular (“berry”) aneurysms are the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and the origin of the posterior communicating artery is a frequently involved site. Intrace&#173;re&#173;bral hemorrhage, which is most commonly due to hypertension, can pre&#173;sent with focal neurologic symptoms but a pupil-&#173;sparing third cranial nerve palsy would be aty&#173;pi&#173;cal. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can cause intrace&#173;re&#173;bral hemorrhage as well as SAH. When associated with SAH, AVMs may manifest with focal seizures, progressive worsening of focal neurologic signs, and recurrent unilateral migraine-&#173;like headache. Intraventricular hemorrhage usually occurs as a secondary phenomenon in patients with an intrace&#173;re&#173;bral or subarachnoid hemorrhage. It typically manifests with sudden-&#173;onset headache, nausea, vomiting, and varying degrees of impaired consciousness.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;30.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> The pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of acute-&#173;onset headache, altered &#173;mental status, and a vitreous hemorrhage is strongly suggestive of Terson syndrome (SAH that &#173;causes a subhyaloidal or vitreous hemorrhage). If left untreated, Terson syndrome has a high mortality rate, and the most impor&#173;tant diagnostic test is thus neuroimaging with noncontrast CT of the brain. A lumbar puncture is indicated for cases in which the initial CT results are negative but suspicion remains high. Although B-&#173;scan ultrasonography may be useful to evaluate the posterior pole, neuroimaging is the most impor&#173;tant imaging study for the initial consideration. Serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-&#173;reactive protein (CRP) tests are useful for the evaluation of suspected &#173;giant cell arteritis (GCA); however, this patient’s pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion (as well as his younger age and history of hypertension) &#173;favor a diagnosis of SAH, not GCA. While urine toxicology tests may be warranted in patients with acute &#173;mental status changes, assessing for the presence of an intracranial hemorrhage is the primary consideration.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;31.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> This patient has recent-&#173;onset transient monocular visual loss (TMVL). Patients presenting with new, recent (<span class="endmatter-answers_symbol">&lt;</span>48 hours) symptoms of TMVL should undergo urgent assessment for embolic etiology with cardiac and carotid imaging. Neuroimaging is unlikely to be diagnostic in cases of isolated TMVL. Observation without assessment of pos&#173;si&#173;ble embolic disease is inappropriate &#173;because such patients may be at increased risk of stroke or myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;32.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Methotrexate, a medi&#173;cation commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), can cause interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis, both of which reduce total lung capacity, indicating a restrictive lung disease pro&#173;cess. Hydroxychloroquine and prednisone are also used to treat RA but have not been associated with restrictive lung disease. Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker used to treat hypertension. It is also used as a second-&#173;line agent when patients develop a cough related to ACE inhibitors.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;33.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> Dry eye syndrome has been reported to increase in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome and the use of a nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask. Dry eye syndrome is not associated with dyspnea, walking up stairs, ankle swelling, or abdominal bloating.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;34.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> Corticosteroid use, especially long-&#173;term oral corticosteroid use, is known to potentiate the development of cataracts. Maintenance medi&#173;cations for the treatment of asthma include inhaled corticosteroids, chromones, leukotriene inhibitors, long acting <span class="endmatter-answers_greek">β</span><span class="Sub _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;agonists, anticholinergic agents, and oral corticosteroids. In this patient, the progressive decrease in vision and the dark defects on retinoscopy represent the development of cataracts resulting from long-&#173;term oral corticosteroid use.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;35.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> A number of inherited and acquired disorders of blood vessels and their supporting connective tissues result in pathologic bleeding. Many of &#173;these disorders also have ocular findings. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Rendu-&#173;Osler-&#173;Weber disease) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by localized dilation of capillaries and venulae of the skin and mucous membranes. The telangiectasia are often located on the lips and tongue. &#173;These lesions increase in size and number over a period of de&#173;cades. Ehlers-&#173;Danlos syndrome is characterized by hyperplastic fragile skin and hyperextensible joints. In patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, bone fractures and otosclerosis (leading to deafness) are common. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is rare and is often complicated by gastrointestinal hemorrhage.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;36.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> In sickle cell anemia, abnormal hemoglobin S damages the red blood cell (RBC) membrane and leads to sickling. This can lead to vascular occlusion, often precipitated by infection, dehydration, and/or hypoxia. Sickle cell disease is a systemic multiorgan disease that requires lifelong routine medical care, which includes regular updating of vaccinations, annual ophthalmologic examinations, and screening for hypertension, proteinuria, and pulmonary hypertension.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;37.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> The most commonly associated ocular manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is keratoconjunctivitis sicca from secondary Sj<span class="endmatter-answers_accent">ö</span>gren syndrome. Other ocular manifestations include ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular occlusions, discoid skin lesions involving the eyelid, and cranial nerve palsies.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;38.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> Approximately 10% of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica eventually develop the vasculitis under&#173;lying GCA. Symptoms include jaw claudication and scalp tenderness. Optic nerve insult may result from GCA, but it is an ischemic event rather than an inflammatory etiology, as with vari&#173;ous &#173;causes of optic neuritis. GCA can be associated with ret&#173;i&#173;nal arterial occlusions, but an embolic workup is not indicated in this clinical scenario, &#173;because GCA-&#173;associated occlusion would result from local inflammatory damage to the vessel. Cavernous sinus syndrome would pre&#173;sent with orbital apex impairment symptoms, including ophthalmoplegia and proptosis.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;39.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> A multisystem vasculitis of unknown etiology, Beh<span class="endmatter-answers_accent">ç</span>et disease is most common in the &#173;Middle East and Asia. Oral ulcers occur in more than 95% of patients with Beh<span class="endmatter-answers_accent">ç</span>et disease, whereas genital ulcers and skin disease occur in about 75%, and central ner&#173;vous system disease in about 20%.</p>
