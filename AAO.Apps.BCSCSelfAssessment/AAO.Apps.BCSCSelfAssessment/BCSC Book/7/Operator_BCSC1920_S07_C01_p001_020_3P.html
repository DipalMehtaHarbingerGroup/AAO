			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology,</span> also discusses ocular anatomy and includes many illustrations.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Dimensions</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The orbits are bony cavities that contain the globes, extraocular muscles, nerves, fat, and blood vessels. Each bony orbit is pear &#173;shaped, tapering posteriorly to the apex and the optic canal. The medial orbital walls are approximately parallel and are separated by 25&#160;mm in the average adult. The widest dimension of the orbit is approximately 1&#160;cm &#173;behind the anterior orbital rim. Average mea&#173;sure&#173;ments of the adult orbit are shown in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;1-1</span>. The&#160;intraorbital segment of the optic nerve has an S-&#173;shaped curve, allowing the eye to rotate and move forward with some freedom, without placing excessive tension on the posterior globe insertion (globe tenting).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Topographic Relationships</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-2">The orbital septum arises anteriorly from the orbital rim. The paranasal sinuses are &#173;either rudimentary or very small at birth, and they increase in size through adolescence. They lie adjacent to the floor, medial wall, and anterior portion of the orbital roof. The orbital walls are composed of 7 bones: ethmoid, frontal, lacrimal, maxillary (maxilla), palatine, sphenoid, and zygomatic. The composition of each of the 4 walls and their location in relation to adjacent extraorbital structures are shown in <span class="xref-figure">Figures&#160;1-1</span>, <span class="xref-figure">1-2</span>, and <span class="xref-figure">1-3</span> and summarized in the following sections.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Roof of the Orbit</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The roof of the orbit is composed of the orbital plate of the frontal bone and the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. It is located adjacent to the anterior cranial fossa and frontal sinus and includes the following impor&#173;tant landmarks:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">the <span class="bullet-list_italic">fossa of the lacrimal gland,</span> which contains the orbital lobe of the lacrimal gland</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">the <span class="bullet-list_italic">fossa for the trochlea of the superior oblique tendon,</span> located 5&#160;mm &#173;behind the superonasal orbital rim</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-4">the <span class="bullet-list_italic">supraorbital notch,</span> or <span class="bullet-list_italic">foramen,</span> which transmits the supraorbital vessels and the supraorbital branch of the frontal nerve</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Lateral Wall of the Orbit</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lateral wall of the orbit is the thickest and strongest of the orbital walls. It is composed of the zygomatic bone and the greater wing of the sphenoid bone and is separated from the lesser wing (portion of the orbital roof) by the superior orbital fissure. It is located adjacent to the &#173;middle cranial fossa and the temporal fossa and commonly extends anteriorly to the equator of the globe, helping to protect the posterior half of the eye while still allowing wide peripheral vision. Impor&#173;tant landmarks include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">the <span class="bullet-list_italic">lateral orbital tubercle of Whitnall,</span> with multiple attachments, including the lateral canthal tendon, the lateral horn of the levator aponeurosis, the check ligament&#160;of the lateral rectus, and the Lockwood ligament (the suspensory ligament of&#160;the globe)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">the <span class="bullet-list_italic">Whitnall ligament,</span> which inserts onto the lateral orbital wall several &#173;millimeters (mm) above the lateral orbital tubercle via attachments to the lacrimal gland fascia</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">the <span class="bullet-list_italic">frontozygomatic suture,</span> located 1&#160;cm above the tubercle</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Medial Wall of the Orbit</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The medial wall of the orbit is composed of the orbital plate of the ethmoid bone, the lacrimal bone, the frontal pro&#173;cess of the maxillary bone, and the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. Of &#173;these, only the lacrimal bone is wholly within the orbital confines. The medial wall of the orbit is located adjacent to the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and nasal cavity. The medial wall of the optic canal is formed by the lesser wing of the sphenoid, which is also the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An impor&#173;tant landmark is the <span class="italic">frontoethmoidal suture,</span> which marks the approximate level of the cribriform plate, the roof of the ethmoids, the floor of the anterior cranial fossa, and the exit of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries from the orbit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The thinnest walls of the orbit are the <span class="italic">lamina papyracea,</span> between the orbit and the ethmoid sinuses along the medial wall, and the <span class="italic">maxillary bone,</span> particularly in its posteromedial portion. &#173;These are the bones most frequently fractured as a result of indirect, or blowout, fractures (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6 in this volume</span>). Acute bacterial infections of the ethmoid sinuses may extend through the lamina papyracea or neurovascular perforations to form a subperiosteal abscess and extend into the orbital soft tissues.</p>
			<p class="h2">Floor of the Orbit</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The orbital floor is made up of the maxillary bone, the palatine bone, and the orbital plate of the zygomatic bone<span class="italic">.</span> The floor of the orbit forms the roof of the maxillary sinus. It does not extend to the orbital apex but instead ends at the pterygopalatine fossa; hence, it is the shortest of the orbital walls.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Impor&#173;tant landmarks include the <span class="italic">infraorbital groove</span> and <span class="italic">infraorbital canal,</span> which transmit the infraorbital artery and the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve.</p>
			<p class="reference--non-journal--single">Dutton JJ. <span class="reference--non-journal-_italic">Atlas of Clinical and Surgical Orbital Anatomy.</span> 2nd&#160;ed. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2011.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Apertures</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The orbital walls are perforated by several impor&#173;tant apertures (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Figs 1-1</span> through <span class="xref-figure-local">1-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Ethmoidal Foramina</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries pass through the corresponding ethmoidal foramina in the medial orbital wall along the frontoethmoidal suture. &#173;These foramina provide a potential route of entry into the orbit for pathogens and neoplasms from the sinuses, and they also serve as a surgical landmark for the superior extent of medial wall surgery. Limiting manipulation of the medial orbital wall to the area below the level of the foramina helps prevent inadvertent entry into the cranial vault. Damage to the medial wall above the level of the foramina may disrupt a plane superior to the cribriform plate.</p>
			<p class="h2">Superior Orbital Fissure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The superior orbital fissure separates the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid bone and transmits cranial nerves (CNs) III, IV, and VI; the first (<span class="italic">ophthalmic</span>) division of CN V; and sympathetic nerve fibers. Most of the venous drainage from the orbit passes through this fissure via the superior ophthalmic vein to the cavernous sinus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-4</span>; see also &#173;<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;</span><span class="xref-figure-local">1-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Inferior Orbital Fissure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The inferior orbital fissure is bounded by the sphenoid, maxillary, and palatine bones and lies between the lateral orbital wall and the orbital floor. It transmits the second (<span class="italic">maxillary</span>) division of CN V, including the zygomatic nerve, and branches of the inferior ophthalmic vein leading to the pterygoid plexus. The maxillary nerve (V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>) exits the skull through the foramen rotundum and travels through the pterygopalatine fossa to enter the orbit at the infraorbital groove. &#173;After giving off the zygomatic branch, the nerve becomes the infraorbital nerve and travels anteriorly in the floor of the orbit through the infraor&#173;bital canal, emerging on the face of the maxillary bone 1&#160;cm below the inferior orbital rim. The infraorbital nerve carries sensation from the lower eyelid, cheek, upper lip, upper teeth, and gingiva.</p>
			<p class="h2">Zygomaticofacial and Zygomaticotemporal Canals</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The zygomaticofacial canal and zygomaticotemporal canal transmit vessels and branches of the zygomatic nerve through the lateral orbital wall to the cheek and the temporal fossa, respectively.</p>
			<p class="h2">Nasolacrimal Canal</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The nasolacrimal canal extends from the lacrimal sac fossa to the inferior meatus beneath the inferior turbinate in the nose. This canal transmits the nasolacrimal duct, which is continuous from the lacrimal sac to the nasal mucosa (see Part III, Lacrimal System).</p>
			<p class="h2">Optic Canal</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The optic canal is 8–10&#160;mm long and is located within the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. This canal is separated from the superior orbital fissure by the bony optic strut. The optic nerve, ophthalmic artery, and sympathetic nerves pass through this canal. The orbital end of the canal is the <span class="italic">optic foramen</span>, which normally mea&#173;sures less than 6.5&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter in adults. Optic canal enlargement accompanies the expansion of the nerve, as seen with optic nerve gliomas. Narrowing of the canal occurs in disorders such as fibrous dysplasia. Blunt trauma may cause an optic canal fracture or shearing of the pial vessels in the foramen, resulting in optic nerve damage.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Soft Tissues</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Periorbita</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The periorbita is the periosteal lining of the orbital bones. At the orbital apex, it fuses with the dura mater covering the optic nerve. Anteriorly, the periorbita is continuous with the orbital septum and the periosteum of the facial bones. The line of fusion of &#173;these layers at the orbital rim is called the <span class="italic">arcus marginalis.</span> The periorbita adheres loosely to the bone except at the orbital margin, sutures, fissures, foramina, tubercles, and canals. In an exenteration, the periorbita can be easily separated except where &#173;these firm attachments are pres&#173;ent. Subperiosteal fluid, such as pus or blood, is usually loculated within &#173;these bound&#173;aries. The periorbita is richly innervated by sensory nerves.</p>
			<p class="h2">Intraorbital Optic Nerve</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The intraorbital portion of the optic nerve is approximately 30&#160;mm long, which allows for eye movement without traction on the insertion of the nerve onto the globe. The optic nerve is 4&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter and is surrounded by the internal sheath, the arachnoid sheath, and the dural sheath, which are continuous with the pia mater, arachnoid mater, and dural mater covering the brain. The dura mater covering the posterior portion of the intraorbital optic nerve fuses with the annulus of Zinn at the orbital apex and is continuous with the periosteum of the optic canal.</p>
			<p class="h2">Extraocular Muscles and Orbital Fat</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The extraocular muscles are responsible for the movement of the eye and for synchronous movements of the eyelids. All of the extraocular muscles, except the inferior oblique muscle, originate at the orbital apex and travel anteriorly to insert onto the eye or eyelid. The 4 <span class="italic">rectus muscles</span> (superior, medial, lateral, and inferior) originate at the annulus of Zinn. The <span class="italic">levator palpebrae superioris muscle</span> arises above the annulus on the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. The <span class="italic">superior oblique muscle</span> originates slightly medial to the levator muscle origin and travels anteriorly through the trochlea on the superomedial orbital rim, where it turns posterolaterally and inserts on the globe beneath the superior rectus muscle. The <span class="italic">inferior oblique muscle</span> originates in the anterior orbital floor lateral to the lacrimal sac and travels posterolaterally within the lower eyelid retractors to insert inferolateral to the macula.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the anterior portion of the orbit, the rectus muscles are connected by a membrane known as the <span class="italic">intermuscular septum.</span> When viewed in the coronal plane, this membrane forms a ring that divides the orbital fat into the <span class="italic">intraconal fat (central surgical space)</span> and the <span class="italic">extraconal fat (peripheral surgical space).</span> &#173;These anatomic designations are helpful for describing the location of a mass on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan. A knowledge of &#173;these spaces helps direct the surgical dissection to the mass.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The orbit is further divided by many fine fibrous septa that unite and support the globe, optic nerve, and extraocular muscles (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-5</span>). Accidental or surgical orbital trauma can disrupt this supporting system and contribute to globe displacement and restriction. In some cases of diplopia &#173;after a fracture, restriction of eye movement is caused by the entrapment of the orbital connective tissue rather than by the muscles themselves.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The motor innervation of the extraocular muscles arises from cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. The superior rectus and levator muscles are supplied by the superior division of CN III <span class="italic">(oculomotor nerve).</span> The inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique muscles are supplied by the inferior division of CN III. The lateral rectus is supplied by CN VI <span class="italic">(abducens nerve).</span> The cranial nerves to the rectus muscles enter the orbit posteriorly through the superior orbital fissure and travel through the intraconal fat to enter the intraconal surface of the muscles at the junction of the posterior third and anterior two-&#173;thirds. Cranial nerve IV (<span class="italic">trochlear nerve</span>) crosses over the levator muscle and innervates the superior oblique on the superior surface at its posterior third. The nerve to the inferior oblique muscle travels anteriorly on the lateral aspect of the inferior rectus to enter the muscle on its posterior surface.</p>
			<p class="h2">Annulus of Zinn</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The annulus of Zinn is the fibrous ring formed by the common origin of the 4 rectus muscles (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-6</span>). The ring encircles the optic foramen and the central portion of the superior orbital fissure. The superior origin of the lateral rectus muscle separates the &#173;superior orbital fissure into 2 compartments. The portion of the orbital apex enclosed by the annulus is called the <span class="italic">oculomotor foramen.</span> This opening transmits CN III (upper and lower divisions), CN VI, and the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic division of CN V (<span class="italic">trigeminal</span>). The superior and lateral aspect of the superior orbital fissure external to the&#160;muscle cone transmits CN IV as well as the frontal and lacrimal branches of the ophthalmic division of CN V. Cranial nerve IV is the only nerve that innervates an extraocular muscle and does not pass directly into the muscle cone when entering the orbit. A retrobulbar block therefore spares this muscle’s action. Cranial nerves III and VI pass directly into the muscle cone through the oculomotor foramen. The superior ophthalmic vein passes through the superior and lateral portion of the superior orbital fissure outside the oculomotor foramen.</p>
			<p class="h2">Vasculature of the Orbit</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The blood supply to the orbit arises primarily from the <span class="italic">ophthalmic artery</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 1-7</span>, <span class="xref-figure">1-8</span>), which is a branch of the internal carotid artery. Smaller contributions come from the external carotid artery by way of the internal maxillary and facial arteries. The ophthalmic artery travels under&#173;neath the intracranial optic nerve through the dura mater along the optic canal to enter the orbit. The major branches of the ophthalmic artery are the</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">branches to the extraocular muscles</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery (to the optic nerve and ret&#173;ina)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">posterior ciliary arteries (long to the anterior segment and short to the choroid)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery travel anteriorly and form rich anastomoses with branches of the external carotid in the face and periorbital region (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-9</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">superior ophthalmic vein</span> provides the main venous drainage of the orbit (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Figs 1-7</span>, <span class="xref-figure-local">1-8</span>). This vein originates in the superonasal quadrant of the orbit and extends posteriorly through the superior orbital fissure into the cavernous sinus. Frequently, the superior ophthalmic vein appears on axial orbital CT scans as the only structure coursing diagonally through the superior orbit. Many anastomoses occur anteriorly with the veins of the face as well as posteriorly with the pterygoid plexus.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Lymphatic System of the Orbit</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The presence of a &#173;human orbital lymphatic system has not been established. However, experimental studies in monkeys have identified orbital lymphatic vessels by means of enzyme histochemistry and electron microscopy in the conjunctiva, lacrimal glands, and dura and arachnoid of the optic nerve. Despite the controversy, it is likely that &#173;human orbital lymphatics exist and may clinically explain the drainage of orbital edema fluid and the existence of orbital lymphatic malformations (<span class="italic">lymphangiomas</span>).</p>
			<p class="reference--non-journal--single ParaOverride-6">Dickinson AJ, Gausas RE. Orbital lymphatics: do they exist? <span class="reference--non-journal-_italic">Eye (Lond).</span> 2006;<br />20(10):1145–1148.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Nerves</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sensory innervation to the periorbital area is provided by the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of CN V (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-10</span>). &#173;After branching off at the trigeminal ganglion, the ophthalmic division of CN V travels in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, where it divides into 3 main branches: frontal, lacrimal, and nasociliary. The <span class="italic">frontal nerve</span> and <span class="italic">lacrimal nerve</span> enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure above the annulus of Zinn (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig 1-6</span>) and travel anteriorly in the extraconal fat to innervate the medial canthus (<span class="italic">supratrochlear branch</span>), upper eyelid (<span class="italic">lacrimal</span> and <span class="italic">supratrochlear branches</span>), and forehead (<span class="italic">supraorbital branch</span>). The <span class="italic">nasociliary branch</span> enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure within the annulus of Zinn, entering the intraconal space and traveling anteriorly to innervate&#160;the eye via the ciliary branches. The short ciliary nerves penetrate the sclera &#173;after passing through the ciliary ganglion without synapse. The long ciliary nerves pass by the ciliary ganglion and enter the sclera, where they extend anteriorly to supply the iris, cornea, and ciliary muscle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The muscles of facial expression, including the orbicularis oculi, procerus, corrugator supercilii, and frontalis muscles, receive their motor supply by way of branches of CN VII (the facial nerve) that enter on the undersurface of each muscle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The parasympathetic innervation, which controls accommodation, pupillary constriction, and lacrimal gland stimulation, follows a complicated course. Parasympathetic innervation enters the eye as the short posterior ciliary nerves &#173;after synapsing within the ciliary ganglion. Parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland originates in the lacrimal nucleus of the pons and eventually joins the lacrimal nerve to enter the lacrimal gland.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sympathetic activity originates in the hypothalamus, with sympathetic fibers descending through the brainstem to the spinal cord, where they continue. Fibers destined for the orbit synapse in the ciliospinal center of Budge-&#173;Waller and then travel with branches of the carotid artery to enter the orbit. The sympathetic nerves carry innervation for pupillary dilation, vasoconstriction, smooth muscle function of the eyelids and orbit, and hidrosis. The nerve fibers follow the arterial supply to the pupil, eyelids, and orbit and travel anteriorly in association with the long ciliary nerves. Interruption of this innervation results in the familiar signs of Horner syndrome: ptosis of the upper eyelid, elevation of the lower eyelid, miosis, anhidrosis, and vasodilation. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>&#160;in BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for detailed discussion of neuro-&#173;ophthalmic anatomy.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lacrimal Gland</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lacrimal gland is composed of a larger <span class="italic">orbital lobe</span> and a smaller <span class="italic">palpebral lobe</span>. The gland is located within a fossa of the frontal bone in the superotemporal orbit. Ducts from both lobes pass through the palpebral lobe and empty into the upper conjunctival fornix. Frequently, a portion of the palpebral lobe is vis&#173;i&#173;ble on slit-&#173;lamp examination with the upper eyelid everted. Biopsy is generally not performed on the palpebral lobe or temporal conjunctival fornix &#173;because it can interfere with lacrimal drainage. The orbital lobe of the lacrimal gland may prolapse inferiorly out of the fossa and pres&#173;ent as a mass in the lateral upper eyelid.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Periorbital Structures</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top6">
			<p class="h2-h1">Nose and Paranasal Sinuses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The bones forming the medial, inferior, and superior orbital walls are close to the nasal cavity and are pneumatized by the paranasal sinuses, which arise from and drain into the nasal cavity. The sinuses decrease the weight of the skull and function as resonators for the voice. The sinuses also support the nasal passages by trapping irritants and by warming and humidifying inhaled air. Pathophysiologic pro&#173;cesses in &#173;these spaces that secondarily affect the orbit include sinonasal carcinomas, inverted papillomas, zygomycoses, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly, Wegener granulomatosis), and mucoceles, as well as sinusitis, which may cause orbital cellulitis or abscess.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The nasal cavity is divided into 2 nasal fossae by the nasal septum. The lateral wall of the nose has 3 bony projections: the superior, &#173;middle, and inferior conchae (<span class="italic">turbinates</span>). The turbinates are covered by nasal mucosa, and they overhang the corresponding meati. Just cephalad to the superior concha is the <span class="italic">sphenoethmoidal recess</span>, into which the sphenoid sinus drains. The frontal sinus, the maxillary sinus, and the anterior and &#173;middle ethmoid air cells drain into the &#173;middle meatus. The nasolacrimal duct opens into the inferior meatus. The nasal cavity is lined by a pseudostratified, ciliated columnar epithelium with copious goblet cells. The mucous membrane overlying the lateral alar cartilage is hair-&#173;bearing and, therefore, less suitable for use as a composite graft in eyelid reconstruction than the mucoperichondrium over the nasal septum.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">frontal sinuses</span> develop from evaginations of the frontal recess and cannot be seen radiographically &#173;until the sixth year of life. Pneumatization of the frontal bone continues through childhood and is complete by early adulthood (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-11</span>). The sinuses can develop asymmetrically and vary greatly in size and shape. Each frontal sinus drains through a separate frontonasal duct and empties into the anterior portion of the &#173;middle meatus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">ethmoid air cells</span> are thin-&#173;walled cavities that lie between the medial orbital wall and the lateral wall of the nose. They are pres&#173;ent at birth and expand as the child grows. Ethmoid air cells can extend into the frontal, lacrimal, and maxillary bones and may extend into the orbital roof (<span class="italic">supraorbital ethmoids</span>)<span class="italic">.</span> The numerous small, thin-&#173;walled air cells of the <span class="italic">ethmoid sinus</span> are divided into anterior, &#173;middle, and posterior. The anterior and &#173;middle air cells drain into the &#173;middle meatus; the posterior air cells, into the superior meatus. Sinusitis in the ethmoids is a common cause of orbital cellulitis and medial orbital subperiosteal abscess when the inflammation or infection spreads into the orbit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">sphenoid sinus</span> evaginates from the posterior nasal roof to pneumatize the sphenoid bone. It is rudimentary at birth and reaches full size &#173;after puberty. The sinus drains into the sphenoethmoidal recess of each nasal fossa. The optic canal is located immediately superolateral to the sinus wall. Pathologic pro&#173;cesses involving the sphenoid sinus compress the optic nerve, leading to visual field abnormalities and vision loss.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">maxillary sinuses</span> are the largest of the paranasal sinuses. The roof of the maxillary sinus forms the floor of the orbit. The maxillary sinuses extend posteriorly in the maxillary bone to the inferior orbital fissure. The infraorbital nerve and artery travel along the roof of the sinus from posterior to anterior. The bony nasolacrimal canal lies within the medial wall. The sinus drains into the &#173;middle meatus of the nose by way of the maxillary ostium. Orbital blowout fractures commonly disrupt the floor of the orbit medial to the infraorbital canal, where the bone is thinnest. The infraorbital nerve is often compromised, causing hypoesthesia of the cheek, upper lip, and maxillary teeth.</p>
