			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A single orbital lesion may involve more than 1 surgical space, and a combination of approaches may be necessary for pathologic pro&#173;cesses affecting the orbit. An operating microscope is sometimes used, particularly for dissection inside the muscle cone. The approaches to &#173;these spaces—&#173;superior, inferior, medial, and lateral—&#173;are discussed in the following sections. Incisions used to reach &#173;these surgical spaces are shown in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;7-2</span>.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Orbitotomy</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Superior Approach</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">More orbital lesions are found in the superoanterior part of the orbit than in any other location. Lesions in this area can usually be accessed through a transcutaneous incision. When this approach is used, care must be taken to avoid damaging the levator muscle, superior oblique muscle, trochlea, lacrimal gland, and sensory nerves and vessels entering or exiting the orbit along the superior orbital rim.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Transcutaneous incisions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A well-&#173;hidden incision in the upper eyelid crease provides access to the superior orbital space (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-3</span>) and offers better cosmesis than an incision placed directly over the superior orbital rim. Both the subperiosteal space and the extraconal space may be approached through this incision. To reach the subperiosteal space, dissection is performed superiorly &#173;toward the orbital rim in a plane between the orbicularis oculi muscle and the orbital septum. An incision is then made at the arcus marginalis where the periosteum of the frontal bone reflects to become the orbital septum, thus entering the subperiosteal space. To access the superior extraconal space, the dissection is instead carried posteriorly through the orbital septum &#173;after the skin incision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The upper eyelid crease incision may also be used for entry into the medial intraconal space. &#173;After opening the orbital septum, the surgeon identifies the medial edge of the levator muscle. Dissection is kept medial to this landmark and proceeds between the medial and central fat pads through the intermuscular septum that extends from the superior rectus muscle to the medial rectus muscle. This approach may be used for biopsy of the optic nerve, for optic nerve sheath fenestration in cases of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or for accessing intraconal lesions medial to the optic nerve.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The coronal approach to the superior orbit is most often used for trauma or craniofacial surgery. This approach is also used for transcranial orbitotomies to provide better access to apical-&#173;based tumors, orbital tumors with intracranial extension, and skull-&#173;based tumors with orbital involvement.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Transconjunctival incisions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Incisions in the superior conjunctiva can be used to reach the superomedial, sub-&#173;Tenon, intraconal, or extraconal surgical spaces. Dissection must be performed medial to the levator muscle to prevent postoperative blepharoptosis. Care should also be taken in the superolateral fornix to avoid damage to the lacrimal ductules.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Vertical eyelid splitting</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vertical splitting of the upper eyelid via a full thickness incision allows an extended transconjunctival exposure for the removal of superomedial intraconal tumors. Careful realignment of the tarsal plate and levator aponeurosis prevents postoperative blepharoptosis, eyelid notching, and eyelid retraction.</p>
			<p class="h2">Inferior Approach</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The inferior approach is useful for accessing masses that are vis&#173;i&#173;ble or palpable in the inferior conjunctival fornix of the lower eyelid, as well as for deeper inferior extraconal or intraconal orbital masses. This approach is also commonly used to approach the orbital floor for fracture repair or decompression.</p>
			<p class="h3">Transcutaneous incisions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vis&#173;i&#173;ble scarring can be minimized by use of a subciliary blepharoplasty incision in the lower eyelid skin (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-4</span>). The orbital septum is exposed through the preseptal orbicularis oculi muscle &#173;toward the inferior orbital rim. A cutaneous incision in the lower eyelid crease or directly over the inferior orbital rim can provide similar access but may leave a more noticeable scar and result in eyelid retraction. Once the skin–&#173;muscle flap is created, the surgeon can open the septum to expose the extraconal surgical space. Alternatively, for access to the inferior subperiosteal space, the periosteum is incised and elevated at the arcus marginalis to expose the orbital floor. Fractures of the orbital floor are reached by the subperiosteal route.</p>
			<p class="h3">Transconjunctival incisions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For access to tumors and fractures of the inferior and medial orbit, the transconjunctival approach (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-5</span>) has largely replaced the transcutaneous approach. An incision is made through the inferior conjunctiva and lower eyelid retractors to reach the extraconal surgical space and the orbital floor. This incision is placed &#173;either just below the inferior tarsal border or in the conjunctival fornix, and the conjunctiva is placed on superior traction. When using cutting cautery, care should be taken to avoid causing thermal damage to the conjunctiva and tarsus. Caution should also be taken to avoid injuring the inferior oblique muscle, inferior rectus muscle, and infraorbital neurovascular bundle (see Fig 7-5C). The optical cavity can be enlarged via a lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis. Dissection is performed in a similar fashion on a preseptal plane inferiorly &#173;toward the orbital rim. The extraconal space can be accessed by incising the orbital septum, and the subperiosteal space can be accessed by incising at the arcus marginalis and elevating the periosteum. Further dissection between the inferior rectus and lateral rectus muscles enables access to the intraconal space.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Alternatively, an incision of the bulbar conjunctiva and Tenon capsule allows entry to the sub-&#173;Tenon surgical space. This approach is also used to gain access to the intraconal surgical space by retracting or reflecting the inferior rectus muscle from the globe.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Medial Approach</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approach to the medial orbit is used in several circumstances, including repair of medial wall trauma, orbital decompression, and access to lacrimal sac or sino-&#173;nasal tumors with orbital involvement. When dissecting in the medial orbit, care should be taken to avoid damaging the medial canthal tendon, lacrimal canaliculi and sac, trochlea, superior oblique tendon and muscle, inferior oblique muscle, and the sensory nerves and vessels along the medial aspect of the superior orbital rim.</p>
			<p class="h3">Transcutaneous incision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tumors within or near the lacrimal sac or the frontal or ethmoid sinuses can be approached through a frontoethmoidal skin incision placed vertically just medial to the insertion of the medial canthal tendon. This route is generally used to enter the subperiosteal space by reflecting the medial canthal tendon in conjunction with the periosteum, thus preserving the lacrimal drainage apparatus.</p>
			<p class="h3">Transconjunctival incision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An incision in the bulbar conjunctiva allows entry into the extraconal or sub-&#173;Tenon surgical space. If the medial rectus muscle is detached, the intraconal surgical space can be entered in the region of the anterior optic nerve for exploration or biopsy. If the posterior optic nerve or muscle cone needs to be accessed, a combined lateral/medial orbitotomy can be performed. A lateral orbitotomy with removal of the lateral orbital wall allows the globe to be displaced temporally, maximizing medial exposure to the deeper orbit.</p>
			<p class="h3">Retrocaruncular incision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This incision may be used for repair of medial wall fractures, for medial orbital bone decompression, and for drainage of medial subperiosteal abscesses. An incision posterior to the caruncle allows excellent exposure of the medial orbit (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-6</span>). Blunt dissection is carried medially, followed by incision and elevation of the periosteum to gain access to the subperiosteal space. In addition, by combining the retrocaruncular incision with an inferior transconjunctival incision, panoramic exposure of the inferior and medial orbit is pos&#173;si&#173;ble. The inferior oblique muscle may be divided at its origin along the inferomedial orbit rim and reattached at the end of surgery (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-7</span>). This approach also provides better cosmesis than the traditional frontoethmoidal incision. However, to protect the canaliculi, care must be taken to remain posterior to the lacrimal drainage apparatus during dissection.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lateral Approach</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A lateral approach to the orbit is used when a lesion is located within the lateral intraconal space, &#173;behind the equator of the globe, or in the fossa of the lacrimal gland. In addition, &#173;because the orbit is relatively shallower in &#173;children than in adults, extensive exposure may be achieved in pediatric patients without the need for bone removal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The traditional curvilinear incision (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig 7-2</span>), which extends from beneath the lateral eyebrow along the zygomatic arch, allows good exposure of the lateral rim but leaves a noticeable scar. It has largely been replaced by approaches through &#173;either an upper eyelid crease incision or an extended lateral canthotomy incision. &#173;After reflection of the temporalis muscle and the periosteum of the orbit, both approaches allow exposure of the lateral orbital rim and the anterior portion of the zygomatic arch. Dissecting through the periorbita and then the intermuscular septum, &#173;either above or below the lateral rectus muscle and posterior to the equator of the globe, provides access to the intraconal retrobulbar space. If a lesion cannot be adequately exposed through a soft tissue lateral incision, an oscillating saw is used to remove the bone of the lateral rim to provide further access (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-8</span>). This procedure is also known as a marginotomy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Complete hemostasis is achieved before closure. To help prevent postoperative intraorbital hemorrhage, an external drain may be placed in the deep orbit. The lateral orbital rim is usually repositioned and sutured back into place through predrilled tunnels. Alternatively, rigid fixation with a microplating system can be employed.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Orbital Decompression</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital decompression is a surgical procedure used to improve the volume-&#173;to-&#173;space discrepancy that occurs primarily in patients with thyroid eye disease (TED). The goal of orbital decompression is to allow the enlarged muscles and orbital fat to expand into the additional space that is created during the surgery (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-9</span>). This expansion relieves pressure on the optic nerve and its blood supply; it also reduces proptosis and orbital congestion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Historically, decompression included removal of the medial orbital wall and much of the orbital floor, including the maxillo-&#173;ethmoidal strut, allowing the orbital tissues to expand into the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. The approach was made through a maxillary vestibular or transcutaneous incision. However, globe ptosis and upper eyelid retraction could be exacerbated postoperatively, especially in patients with large, restricted inferior rectus muscles. This type of decompression could also disrupt globe excursion due to prolapse of the muscles into the sinus space and displacement of the orbital contents.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The approach currently used by many orbital surgeons combines 1 or more discrete incisions that allow access to the lateral, inferior, and/or medial walls. Entry to the lateral and inferior orbit is provided by an upper eyelid crease incision, an extended lateral canthotomy incision, or an inferior transconjunctival incision combined with a lateral canthotomy/inferior cantholysis. Decompression of the lateral wall can be achieved by using rongeurs and/or a drill to remove bone along the sphenoid wing (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-10</span>). A retro&#173;&#173;caruncular incision allows an excellent approach to the medial orbital wall; it can be used in conjunction with a transconjunctival incision for further access. Alternatively, a transnasal endoscopic approach to the medial orbit via the ethmoid sinus may be used to access the medial wall.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some surgeons choose to decompress the orbit in a “balanced” manner by removing bone from the opposing walls, believing this &#173;will reduce the risk of worsened or new onset diplopia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-11</span>). For further decompression, occasionally some surgeons &#173;will remove the lateral orbital rim and/or reposition it anteriorly at the time of closure. Anterior displacement of the lateral canthus may also aid in the reduction of eyelid retraction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fat decompression with removal of retrobulbar fat further reduces proptosis and has also been shown to be beneficial in patients with compressive optic neuropathy. However, decompression through the orbital roof into the anterior cranial fossa is inadvisable.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Postoperative Care for Orbital Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Mea&#173;sures used to reduce postoperative edema include elevation of the head, iced compresses on the eyelids, administration of systemic corticosteroids, and optional placement of a drain. Ice packs minimize swelling and allow for observation of the operative site and monitoring of visual acuity. The patient is instructed to promptly contact the surgeon with any change of vision. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics may also be given.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Special Surgical Techniques in the Orbit</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fine-&#173;needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) may have value in selected cases, including lymphoid lesions, secondary tumors invading the orbit from the sinuses, suspected metastatic tumors, and blind eyes with optic nerve tumors (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-12</span>). This technique is not very effective for obtaining tissue from fibrous inflammatory lesions &#173;because of the difficulty in successfully aspirating cells. Although historically FNAB has not been considered effective for biopsy in lymphoproliferative disorders, technological advances have improved its diagnostic yield when used in combination with flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies or polymerase chain reaction analy&#173;sis. If necessary, imaging techniques, such as ultrasonography or computed tomography, can be used to help guide the needle into the tumor. Cells (and occasionally a small block of tissue) are aspirated from the lesion. A skilled cytologist is required to study the specimen. See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for further discussion of FNAB.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because of the anatomic relationship of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses to the medial and inferior orbit, respectively, endoscopic transnasal surgery may be considered. Such an approach may permit biopsy and/or resection of some intraconal pathology. It may also be combined with open orbitotomy to allow improved access to apical pro&#173;cesses. In addition, decompression of the orbit or optic canal may be considered for patients with TED or nontraumatic compressive optic neuropathy. Such an approach can also be used for drainage of medial subperiosteal orbital abscesses in patients with sinusitis or for debridement of necrotic tissue in patients with fungal orbital cellulitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tumors and traumatic injuries of the skull base may involve the superior and posterior orbit. Advanced surgical techniques allow access to &#173;these areas via a frontal craniotomy or frontotemporal-&#173;orbitozygomatic (FTOZ) approach. Such procedures require a multidisciplinary team. The neurosurgeon provides the orbital surgeon with unparalleled access to the deep superior and lateral orbit by removing the frontal bar and the orbital roof. &#173;These techniques enable the decompression of the optic canal, as well as resection of tumors such as meningiomas, fibrous dysplasia, cavernous venous malformations, solitary fibrous tumors, schwannomas, and gliomas.</p>

			<p class="h1">Complications of Orbital Surgery</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The surgeon can reduce complications from orbital surgery by performing a complete preoperative evaluation with orbital imaging when indicated, choosing the appropriate surgical approach, obtaining adequate exposure, manipulating the tissues carefully, employing proper instrumentation and illumination, maintaining excellent hemostasis, and using a team approach when appropriate.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Decreased or lost vision is a serious complication of surgery that may be caused by excessive traction on the globe and optic nerve, contusion of the optic nerve, postoperative infection, or hemorrhage, which leads to increased orbital pressure and consequent ische&#173;mic injury to the optic nerve. A patient who has severe orbital pain postoperatively should be evaluated immediately for pos&#173;si&#173;ble orbital hemorrhage. If this pain is associated with decreased vision, proptosis, ecchymosis, increased intraocular pressure, and an afferent pupillary defect, the surgeon should consider opening the wound to minimize the effects of orbital compartment syndrome (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6&#160;in this volume</span>), evacuating any hematoma, and controlling active bleeding.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to vision loss, pos&#173;si&#173;ble complications &#173;after orbital surgery include:</p>
