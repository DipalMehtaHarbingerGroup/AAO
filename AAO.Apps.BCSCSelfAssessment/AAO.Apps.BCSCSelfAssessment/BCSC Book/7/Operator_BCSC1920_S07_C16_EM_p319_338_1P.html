They are provided &#173;here for your own educational use and identification of any professional practice gaps. The required CME posttest is available online (see “Requesting CME&#160;Credit”). Following the questions are a blank answer sheet and answers with discussions. Although a concerted effort has been made to avoid ambiguity and redundancy in &#173;these questions, the authors recognize that differences of opinion may occur regarding the “best” answer. The discussions are provided to demonstrate the rationale used to derive the answer. They may also be helpful in confirming that your approach to the prob&#173;lem was correct or, if necessary, in fixing the princi&#173;ple in your memory.

			<p class="em-only_endmatter-title">Answers</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> The clinical scenario presented is a right orbital floor fracture. The infraorbital groove and infraorbital canal, which transmit the infraorbital artery and the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, travel along the orbital floor and can be injured. Clinically, patients are likely to pre&#173;sent with cranial nerve (CN) V<span class="endmatter-answers_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> hypoesthesia that is typically transient. Epistaxis is more likely to occur &#173;after medial wall fracture or trauma. Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea is likely to occur &#173;after an orbital roof fracture. Diplopia following a floor fracture is more likely to occur in vertical gaze rather than horizontal gaze.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;2.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for use in the treatment of recurrent melanoma. They work by “unleashing” T cells that are normally kept in check by signaling proteins. This allows for an immune response against the melanoma. Checkpoint inhibitors target the PD-1 protein, not CTLA-4, to boost the immune response against melanoma cells. They are not used for the treatment of &#173;either basal cell carcinoma or recurrent multiple myeloma. The sonic hedgehog signaling pathway of basal cell carcinoma is treated by a variety of sonic hedgehog inhibitors (eg, vismodegib), not checkpoint inhibitors.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;3.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> A perineural spread of a cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) along the facial sensory nerves into the skull base (orbital apex and cavernous sinus) should be suspected in any patient with actinic changes or a history of facial cutaneous malignancies who pre&#173;sents with progressive periocular sensory and motor changes. SCC has a propensity for sensory nerves, and it occurs much more frequently in individuals with chronic &#173;immunosuppression (eg, &#173;those who have under&#173;gone renal transplantation). Bacterial sinusitis typically occurs in a fulminant fashion, and orbital involvement usually manifests with external eyelid changes (eg, erythema, edema) and proptosis. However, more indolent fungal sinusitis, especially aspergillosis, may occur in a slowly progressive manner. Tolosa-&#173;Hunt syndrome is an ill-&#173;defined cavernous sinus inflammation that pre&#173;sents with explosive pain and responds to systemic corticosteroids. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, &#173;because other pathologies may mimic its symptoms. Microvascular cranial neuropathy typically affects only 1 cranial nerve and typically resolves within 100 days. It does not usually affect sensory nerves.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;4.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> Dog bites are polymicrobial; they include anaerobes and aerobes (both gram-&#173;positive and gram-&#173;negative), as well as specific species such as <span class="endmatter-answers_italic">Pasteurella canis.</span> Therefore, bites should be treated with broad-&#173;spectrum coverage.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;5.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> Although observing the contour of the eyelids and the position of the puncta, reviewing the medical history and the mechanism of the trauma, and probing and irrigating the lacrimal outflow may all provide some information about the status of the canthal tendons and their pos&#173;si&#173;ble need for repair, the only definitive (and therefore mandatory) way to determine &#173;whether &#173;there is an avulsion involves pulling directly on the eyelid, against the vector of the tendon. Probing and irrigation assess tear outflow, which could be affected by a medial canthal injury.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;6.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Eyelid retraction in downgaze that &#173;causes an increase in the margin–&#173;reflex distance 1 (MRD<span class="endmatter-answers_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>) is typical of congenital ptosis, in which the muscle is maldeveloped and is thus unable to relax and stretch in downgaze. However, this may also be true for infiltrative and compressive lesions involving the levator muscle, and in congenital ptosis, &#173;there should be normal retropulsion of the globes. Ocular myasthenia is associated with fluctuating ptosis, which is not discussed in this scenario. Finally, dehiscence of the aponeurosis is not associated with lid lag as noted in downgaze.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;7.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Considering the constellation of ptosis, breathing difficulties, and trou&#173;ble swallowing, myasthenia gravis is a reasonable and somewhat urgent concern, and the patient should undergo electromyography and erdrophonium (Tensilon) testing to confirm the diagnosis. Although antibody testing is useful, it &#173;will take time to get the results. Surgery is typically considered only &#173;after a diagnosis has been made and, if pos&#173;si&#173;ble, the condition has been medically managed.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;8.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> Disorders of eyelid closure associated with ocular surface and tear film irregularities would be the most likely cause, particularly in a patient who has under&#173;gone an overly aggressive brow-&#173;lift and/or upper eyelid blepharoplasty. Central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion (CRAO) and soft tissue necrosis are certainly potential complications from injection of fillers; however, the former would pre&#173;sent with frank and complete or partial vision loss without discomfort, and the latter would cause fairly immediate redness and swelling as well as facial (but not necessarily eye) discomfort. Facial palsy is a less likely complication from skin-&#173;tightening procedures than are paresis or lagophthalmos.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;9.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> &#173;Because herpes virus reactivation can lead to severe facial skin infection and permanent scarring, most surgeons prophylactically treat patients with antiviral medi&#173;cation against outbreaks of herpes simplex virus prior to &#173;laser skin resurfacing. Eyelid malposition can occur with excessive tightening of skin and may require additional surgeries to treat lagophthalmos or ectropion (not entropion). Fat removal is not treated with laser resurfacing, but rather with blepharoplasty. Pigmentary skin changes, particularly with darker-&#173;pigmented patients, may be a relative contraindication for the procedure. In many cases, skin resurfacing serves as an adjunct procedure with blepharoplasty in order to better correct tissue laxity.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;10.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> The lacrimal gland is not fully developed and functional &#173;until the infant is about 6 weeks old. Thus, newborn infants do not produce tears when crying.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;11.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> Canalicular obstruction resulting from chemotherapeutic agents such as docetaxel (or 5-&#173;fluorouracil) is treated with conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy, &#173;because a dacryocystorhinostomy procedure requires intact canaliculi through which the intubation tubes are placed. Intermittent irrigation is usually not sufficient to treat the tearing, and prophylactic intubation is best done prior to the onset of chronic tearing and structural canalicular stenosis. Punctal plugs are used to treat aqueous tear deficiency and are not appropriate in the setting of a canalicular obstruction.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;12.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> Enophthalmos may occur as a result of volume expansion of the orbit (fracture), in association with orbital varix or secondary to sclerosing orbital tumors (eg, metastatic breast carcinoma). Metastatic prostate carcinoma is most likely to displace the globe anteriorly, especially if it has metastasized intraconally. Similarly, meningiomas typically displace the globe anteriorly. A maxillary sinus tumor is most likely to invade the orbit from the floor, displacing the globe superiorly.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;13.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both impor&#173;tant imaging modalities in the detection and characterization of orbital and ocular &#173;diseases. For evaluating a trauma, however, CT is currently the primary and single most–&#173;useful orbital imaging technique. It is often readily available and rapidly provides the information necessary for decision-&#173;making. Although contrast agents can be used, they are not necessary for orbital evaluation following trauma. MRI generally provides better tissue contrast than CT; however, in most orbital conditions, the orbital fat provides sufficient natu&#173;ral tissue contrast to allow ready visualization of orbital tumors on CT.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;14.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> During resection of a dermolipoma, the overlying conjunctiva should be preserved. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the lacrimal gland ducts, the extraocular muscles, and the levator aponeurosis. Although the glands of Wolfring are salivary excretory glands, &#173;these are fewer in quantity and distribution along the conjunctiva. The meibomian glands and the glands of Zeis are sebaceous glands that contribute to the tear film on the eyelid margin and on the lash cilia, respectively, and neither would likely be involved during the excision of a dermolipoma.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;15.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> The clinical scenario presented is new-&#173;onset thyroid eye disease. Although the patient’s symptoms are moderate, the next appropriate step is to complete the workup to establish the diagnosis and the stage of the disease pro&#173;cess. Her surface disease should be managed nonsurgically for now, and her response to treatment should be reevaluated prior to proceeding with surgical intervention. Surgery may be required, but the typical pattern of management is orbital decompression, followed by strabismus surgery, and then eyelid retraction.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;16.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> Immunoglobulin G4–&#173;related disease (IgG4-&#173;RD) is a fibroinflammatory disorder that may affect 1 or more organs. The disease most commonly affects the lacrimal gland within the orbit. Histologic examination shows lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates with large numbers of IgG4-&#173;positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis, and &#173;eosinophil infiltration. In most cases, the ratio of IgG4/IgG plasma cells is greater than 40%. &#173;Serologic testing may show peripheral eosinophilia and elevated IgG4, but IgE is not typical. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), a lymphokine produced by activated T cells, has a wide variety of actions and plays a central role in immune regulation; however, IL-2 histology is not necessary for IgG4-&#173;related diseases. TNF-<span class="CharOverride-9">α</span> levels are not diagnostic for IgG4-RD.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;17.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> &#173;Silent sinus syndrome results from chronic subclinical sinusitis, which &#173;causes thinning of the bone of the involved sinus, leading to enophthalmos due to collapse of the orbital floor. The spontaneous collapse often occurs in association with a recent significant change in atmospheric pressure, for example in airplane travel or scuba diving. Osteoma is a nonepithelial tumor that can invade the orbit from the sinuses, nose, and facial bones. It is not typically spontaneous nor rapid in progression; thus, time to diagnosis may be slow. At the time of diagnosis, &#173;there may be extensive orbital involvement, a palpable orbital mass, and ocular muscle restriction. Plexiform neurofibromas are tumors formed by diffuse proliferation of Schwann cells within nerve sheaths. They are often associated with von Recklinghausen disease (neurofibromatosis 1), in which hamartomas may develop in the skin, eyes, central ner&#173;vous system, and viscera. The most common orbital finding associated with plexiform neurofibromatosis is infiltration of the lateral upper eyelid, which &#173;causes an S-&#173;shaped contour to the eyelid margin and pos&#173;si&#173;ble proptosis. Pseudotumor cerebri (also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension) can cause cranial nerve VI palsy, which &#173;causes horizontal deviations, not vertical deviations.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;18.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Orbital compartment syndrome (OCS) may occur in a variety of settings (eg, posttraumatic or postsurgical hemorrhage, abscess formation, noninfectious inflammation). Posttraumatic OCS usually results from hemorrhage. Large orbital fractures expand the orbital compartment into the adjacent paranasal sinuses, and this may be relatively protective against the development of OCS.&#160;However, if bleeding continues, blood &#173;will fill this larger compartment, resulting in OCS.&#160;Therefore, it is impor&#173;tant not to discount the possibility of OCS in patients with orbital fractures. Prompt lateral canthotomy and cantholysis should be performed by the emergency department physician, particularly if the ophthalmologist is not able to perform the procedure in a timely fashion. Inadequate cantholysis &#173;will not relieve the OCS, and complete release should be verified once the ophthalmologist has arrived. Conservative management with IV fluids and pain management &#173;will only mask the pain noted in OCS. OCS is a clinical entity that can result in permanent visual loss if diagnosis is delayed. Therefore, definitive management should not be delayed by waiting for CT. OCS rarely manifests as a discrete hematoma on CT, but rather appears as an increased reticular signal in the intraconal fat. Posterior globe tenting may be seen on axial and parasagittal images, &#173;because the posterior sclera is distorted by proptosis and a stretched optic nerve. Bony orbital decompression is rarely needed in a patient with OCS. Use of intraveous mannitol may temporarily stabilize the OCS. If the OCS has not resolved, orbital surgery may be required.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;19.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Wooden orbital foreign bodies are the most common vegetal &#173;matter to enter the orbit. They often splinter upon orbital entry, and this may make them difficult to identify and remove during orbitotomy. It is not unusual for the patient to need several surgeries for removal, &#173;because each individual retained splinter &#173;causes orbital infection over time. In most cases, wooden orbital foreign bodies appear radiolucent on CT, although treated or painted lumber may appear radiopaque. The CT signal of wood is often misinterpreted as air. However, careful mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the specific Hounsfield units of the suspected wood and comparison to known air (eg, in the paranasal sinuses) by the radiologist often clinches the diagnosis and is a tool that should be used by the clinician. Wooden foreign bodies are notorious for causing severe orbital infections with aty&#173;pi&#173;cal organisms, and &#173;these infections can result in permanent visual loss or spread along the skull base. However, the majority of &#173;these organisms are bacterial, not fungal. Concomitant intracranial involvement may occur with orbital wooden foreign bodies, but this is an exception rather than the rule. That said, any break in the orbital roof on CT should raise this possibility.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;20.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> Orbital roof fractures occur much more commonly in young &#173;children than adults for 2 main reasons. First, pneumatized frontal sinuses, the structures that absorb much of the force of a frontal blow in adults, are not yet developed in &#173;children. This absence of pneumatized frontal sinuses allows force to be transferred directly to the orbital roof, resulting in fracture. Second, an infant or toddler has a much higher cranial vault-&#173;to-&#173;face ratio than an adult (8:1 vs 2:1, respectively) along with a flatter face, lacking the midfacial and nasal projection of adults. This results in a larger and more prominent forehead that is more susceptible to injury. The frontal lobe is not underdeveloped in young &#173;children.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;21.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> A transnasal endoscopic approach to the orbit is useful in managing disease in the medial orbit. One of the most common uses of the transnasal approach is for removal of the lamina papyracea during medial orbital wall decompression for thyroid eye disease. The technique provides an excellent view of the medial orbital wall, optic canal, and skull base. Additionally, it has the theoretical advantage of minimizing iatrogenic compression of orbital soft tissue in an already congested orbit, since bone is removed from “outside in,” as opposed to the transcaruncular approach. This technique should not be used in accessing lesions lateral to the optic nerve (lateral orbital apex ciliary ganglion). A superomedial dermoid cyst is usually located relatively anteriorly within the orbit and requires wide dissection for complete excision to avoid rupture; this is best achieved using standard anterior orbitotomy techniques.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;22.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> Following an orbitotomy, patients can be observed for several hours postoperatively and then discharged to their homes, especially if the surgery was &#173;limited to the anterior orbit. Intravenous or oral corticosteroids are often prescribed in the immediate post&#173;operative period to reduce edema in the hope of minimizing optic neuropathy. However, &#173;there is no definitive evidence that corticosteroids or antibiotics are effective or essential in all orbitotomies. More complex or deeper orbitotomies with a higher risk of postoperative orbital hemorrhages may be observed overnight and may require a drain, but a drain is usually not essential in anterior orbitotomies. Pressure patching is useful during extubation, but the patch should be removed once the patient is awake enough to cooperate with a clinical examination, both to ensure that &#173;there is no iatrogenic optic neuropathy and to allow the patient to monitor visual function postoperatively.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;23.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> Chronic mucus discharge from an anophthalmic socket is usually due to a papillary conjunctivitis. This is thought to occur from protein buildup on the surface of the prosthesis, which then induces a conjunctival reaction. Prosthesis polishing and a course of topical corticosteroid drops often improve the symptoms. Implant extrusion can pre&#173;sent in a similar fashion, but it is less common than papillary conjunctivitis. Implant infection is usually painful, and examination reveals purulent discharge. The weight of the prosthesis can stretch the lower eyelid over time, but this typically manifests as lower eyelid laxity with or without ectropion rather than entropion.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;24.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> It is likely that the biggest advantage of enucleation over evisceration is that it &#173;will not expose an occult intraocular malignancy or disseminate it into the orbit. Evisceration should never be performed without a preoperative B-&#173;scan ultrasound to effectively rule out an intraocular mass. Neither CT nor MRI is as sensitive as B-&#173;scan in this regard. The pos&#173;si&#173;ble increase in sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) rates following evisceration is controversial. &#173;Because of the rarity of SO, &#173;there is no large study proving the association between evisceration and SO. Evisceration is technically simpler to perform than enucleation, often requiring less intraoperative time and anesthesia. Implant motility is as good or &#173;better for evisceration compared with enucleation. Implant extrusion rates are likely equivalent between enucleation and evisceration; when performing evisceration on a phthisical eye, posterior sclerotomies are often necessary to accommodate the implant.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;25.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">d.</span> The facial nerve moves from a location deep to the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) below the zygoma to superficial to the SMAS above the zygoma (the temporoparietal or superficial temporalis fascia); therefore, dissection in &#173;these locations requires caution. The innervation of the orbicularis is broad across the eyelid, so an eyelid crease incision does not paralyze the muscle.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;26. &#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> The safest area to perform a temporal artery biopsy (TAB) of the frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery (STA) is &#173;either above the brow or more than 3.5&#160;cm lateral to the lateral canthus. Brow ptosis is not an issue at all if the parietal branch of the STA is biopsied, but this usually requires shaving back the hairline. Although this adds a step to the procedure, it also hides the incision once the hair has grown back. The frontal branch of the facial nerve runs very superficially along the zygomatic arch and is vulnerable to injury if a TAB is performed in this location. Similarly, studies have shown that incisions within 3.5&#160;cm of the lateral canthus or lateral eyebrow and below the brow have a higher incidence of brow ptosis. The area that lies between the zygomatic arch and the brow vertically and the lateral canthus to 3.5&#160;cm lateral to it horizontally has therefore been dubbed the “danger zone” and should be avoided.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;27.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">a.</span> The anatomy of the lower eyelid is more primitive than that of the upper eyelid, but does allow for lower eyelid retraction during infraduction to clear the visual axis. This occurs &#173;because of a linkage between the inferior rectus and the inferior tarsus via the capsulopalpebral fascia (CPF). The outer fascia of the inferior rectus extends anteriorly to split around the inferior oblique muscle (IOM, which runs roughly perpendicular to the inferior rectus muscle) and then fuses at the anterior edge of the IOM to form the Lockwood suspensory ligament. The CPF arises from this area to attach to the inferior tarsus. Thus, as the inferior rectus muscle contracts to infraduct the eye, the CPF is pulled posteriorly and the tarsus (and lower eyelid) retracts inferiorly. The orbital septum is a static structure best described as an extension of periosteum arising at the arcus marginalis (orbital rim). The inferior tarsal muscle is a rudimentary smooth muscle akin to the superior tarsal muscle (M<span class="endmatter-answers_accent">ü</span>ller muscle) of the upper eyelid and is difficult to identify as a separate layer during surgery. From a practical standpoint, surgeons simply refer to the fused inferior tarsal muscle and CPF as one surgical layer (the “lower eyelid retractors”). Note that the inferior tarsal muscle is sympathetically innervated and can become paretic in Horner syndrome, resulting in a “reverse ptosis” of the lower eyelid; in other words, in Horner syndrome, the affected lower eyelid would be higher than the normal side.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">&#9;28.&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">b.</span> The peripheral arterial arcade is an impor&#173;tant anatomic landmark in upper eyelid surgery. It is located between the levator aponeurosis and M<span class="endmatter-answers_accent">ü</span>ller muscle just above the superior border of tarsus. Identification of the arcade during upper eyelid surgery means that the levator aponeurosis has dehisced. If this occurs during upper eyelid blepharoplasty, it may result in postoperative ptosis due to levator dehiscence. If the arcade is noted during blepharoplasty, the levator may need to be reattached to tarsus. Also, it is impor&#173;tant to remember that both the upper and lower eyelid contain a marginal arterial arcade, but usually only the upper eyelid harbors a peripheral arcade.</p>
			<p class="em-only_endmatter-answers">29.&#9;&#9;<span class="endmatter-answers_bold">c.</span> Both the suborbicularis oculi fat (SOOF) and retro-&#173;orbicularis oculi fat (ROOF) separate facial mimetic muscles (orbicularis) from under&#173;lying periosteum. Orbital fat is &#173;behind the septum, a completely separate anatomic space, although the prolapse of orbital fat, SOOF, and ROOF contributes to aging effects. The temporal fat pad is sandwiched in as the deep temporalis fascia splits &#173;going over the zygomatic arch.</p>
