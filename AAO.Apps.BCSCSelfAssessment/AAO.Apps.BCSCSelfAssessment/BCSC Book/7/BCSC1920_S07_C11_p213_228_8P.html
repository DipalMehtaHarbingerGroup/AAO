			<div id="Chapt11_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Injuries of the eyelid may be divided into 2 categories: blunt trauma and penetrating trauma. Cardinal rules in the management of eyelid trauma include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5">Take a careful history.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Rec&#173;ord the best visual acuity for each eye.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Thoroughly evaluate the globe and orbit.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Obtain appropriate radiologic studies.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Have a detailed knowledge of eyelid and orbital anatomy.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-6">Ensure the best pos&#173;si&#173;ble primary repair.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Blunt Trauma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ecchymosis and edema are the most common presenting signs of blunt trauma. Patients should be evaluated for intraocular injury with a thorough biomicroscopic evaluation and dilated fundus examination. Computed tomography may be indicated to assess for an orbital fracture. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>&#160;in this volume for further discussion of orbital fractures.</p>
			<p class="h2">Penetrating Trauma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The treatment of eyelid lacerations depends on the depth and location of the injury. Detailed knowledge of eyelid anatomy is required to optimize repair and reduce the need for secondary repairs.</p>
			<p class="h3">Lacerations not involving the eyelid margin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Superficial eyelid lacerations involving just the skin and orbicularis oculi muscle usually require only skin sutures, with or without buried subcutaneous sutures. Unnecessary scarring can be avoided by following the basic princi&#173;ples of repair, including conservative wound debridement, use of small-&#173;caliber sutures, wound edge eversion, and early suture removal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The presence of orbital fat in the wound indicates that the orbital septum has been &#173;violated (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-1</span>). Prior to repair, any foreign bodies in the wound should be identified and removed, and the wound should be properly irrigated. Orbital fat prolapse in the wound&#160;is also an indication for exploration of the levator muscle and aponeurosis. If lacerated,&#160;the levator muscle or aponeurosis must be carefully repaired to enable the levator muscle to function normally. Upper eyelid retraction and tethering to the superior orbital rim are common if the orbital septum is inadvertently incorporated into the repair. Similarly, orbital septum lacerations should not be sutured to avoid eyelid retraction from vertical shortening of the sutured orbital septum.</p>
			<p class="h3">Lacerations involving the eyelid margin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Repair of eyelid margin lacerations requires precise suture placement and suture tension to minimize notching of the eyelid margin. Tarsal approximation and anatomical alignment of the eyelid margin should be meticulous in order to precisely repair the eyelid margin (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;11-2</span>, <span class="xref-figure">11-3</span>). The eyelid margin is typically aligned by placing interrupted silk sutures through the lash line, meibomian gland plane, and the gray line. Additional nonmarginal tarsal sutures are placed through the height of the lacerated tarsus to strengthen the margin closure, as well as to avoid imbrication of the tarsal edges. To prevent corneal abrasion, the sutures should be partial thickness through the tarsus without extension through the conjunctival surface, and the suture tails should be directed away from the ocular surface. Eyelid margin closure should result in a moderate eversion of the well-&#173;approximated wound edges. Resorbable, buried, vertical mattress sutures may be used in the margin as an alternative to externally tied sutures.</p>
			<p class="h3">Trauma involving the canthal soft tissue</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Trauma to the medial or lateral canthal areas is usually the result of horizontal traction on the eyelid, which &#173;causes avulsion at the eyelid’s weakest points, the medial or lateral canthal tendon. Lacerations in the medial canthal area require evaluation of the lacrimal drainage apparatus, with canalicular involvement confirmed by inspection and gentle probing (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-4</span>). &#173;These lacerations are discussed in more detail in Chapter&#160;15&#160;in this volume.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The integrity of the inferior and superior limbs of the medial or lateral canthal tendon can be assessed by grasping each eyelid with toothed forceps and tugging away from the injury while palpating the insertion of the tendon. Medial canthal tendon avulsion should be suspected when &#173;there is rounding of the medial canthal &#173;angle and acquired telecanthus. Treatment of medial canthal tendon avulsions depends on the extent of the avulsion. Attention to the posterior tendinous attachment to the posterior lacrimal crest is critical. If the upper or lower limb is avulsed but the posterior attachment of the tendon is intact, the avulsed limb may be sutured to its stump or to the periosteum overlying the anterior lacrimal crest. If the entire tendon, including the posterior portion, is avulsed but &#173;there is&#160;no&#160;naso-&#173;orbital fracture, the avulsed tendon may be wired through small drill holes in the ipsilateral posterior lacrimal crest. If the entire tendon is avulsed and &#173;there is a naso-&#173;orbital fracture, transnasal wiring or plating is necessary &#173;after fracture reduction. A Y-&#173;shaped miniplate may be fixed anteriorly on the nasal bone, extending posteriorly into the orbit. The suture is sewn through the transected tendon and passed through holes in the miniplate. This technique is particularly helpful when the bone of the posterior lacrimal crest is absent.</p>
			<p class="h2">Secondary Repair</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Secondary repair of eyelid trauma usually requires treatment of cicatricial changes that resulted from &#173;either the initial trauma or the surgical repair (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-5</span>). Scar revision may require a &#173;simple excision with primary closure or a more complex tissue rearrangement. The location of a scar in relation to the relaxed skin tension lines determines the best technique or combination of techniques to use. An elliptical scar excision is most useful for revising scars that follow the relaxed skin tension lines. Single or multiple Z-&#173;plasty flap techniques can be used to revise scars that do not conform to relaxed skin tension lines.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Free skin grafts, performed alone or in combination with vari&#173;ous flaps, are used when tissue has been lost or when lengthening of the anterior lamella is required. Although any non–&#173;hair-&#173;bearing skin can be used, the ideal donor site for eyelid reconstruction is full-&#173;thickness upper eyelid skin. Harvested skin should be similar in color and thickness to the skin it is replacing, and it should also be hairless and supple, with minimal actinic damage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tarsoconjunctival flaps are good substitutes for posterior lamella eyelid defects when both the tarsal plate and conjunctiva are deficient. Buccal mucosa may be used when only the conjunctiva is missing. Hard palate composite grafts can be used for posterior lamella tarsal defects in the lower eyelid; however, &#173;these grafts should be avoided in the upper eyelid due to the presence of keratinized epithelium, which can irritate the cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Before treatment is considered for traumatic ptosis, the patient can be observed for 3–6 months to allow for spontaneous improvement. An exception to this rule may be amblyogenic ptosis in a young child.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Dog and &#173;Human Bites</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tearing and crushing injuries occur secondary to dog or &#173;human bites. Partial-&#173;thickness and full-&#173;thickness eyelid lacerations, canthal avulsions, and canalicular lacerations are common. Tissue loss is uncommon but may occur. Irrigation and early wound repair are preferred, and tetanus and rabies protocols should be observed. Systemic antibiotics are recommended for mixed organism flora specific to dog bites, which most often include <span class="italic">Pasteurella canis,</span> as&#160;well as aerobes (streptococci, staphylococci, <span class="italic">Moraxella,</span> and <span class="italic">Neisseria</span>), and anaerobes <span class="italic">(Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas).</span> Ocular and canalicular injuries are seen most commonly in &#173;children, and more often in association with dog bites from mixed breeds, German shepherds, Labrador retrievers, pit bull terriers, and rottweilers.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Burns</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Burns of the eyelid are rare and are generally seen in patients who have sustained significant burns over large areas of the body. Often, &#173;these patients are semiconscious or heavi&#173;ly sedated and require ocular surface protection to prevent corneal exposure, ulceration, and infection (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-6</span>). Lubricating antibiotic ointments, moisture chambers, and frequent evaluation of both the globes and the eyelids are part of the early treatment of &#173;these patients. Once cicatricial changes begin in the eyelids, relentless and rapid deterioration of the patient’s ocular status often ensues secondary to cicatricial ectropion and eyelid retraction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-7</span>), lagophthalmos, and corneal exposure. If tarsorrhaphies are used, they should always be more extensive than seems to be immediately necessary. Unfortunately, with progression of the cicatricial traction, even the most aggressive eyelid adhesions may dehisce. In the past, skin grafting was usually delayed &#173;until the cicatricial changes stabilized, but the early use of full-&#173;thickness skin grafts, amniotic membrane, and vari&#173;ous types of flaps can effectively reduce ocular morbidity in select patients. Cicatrization may also be reduced with the early use of ablative fractional &#173;laser and wound modulators (5-&#173;fluorouracil).</p>

			<p class="h1">Eyelid and Canthal Reconstruction</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following discussion of eyelid reconstruction applies to defects resulting from tumor resection as well as congenital and traumatic defects. Several techniques may be appropriate for reconstruction of a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar eyelid defect. The choice of procedure depends on multiple &#173;factors, including the patient’s age and comorbidities, the condition of the eyelids, the size and position of the defect, and the surgeon’s personal preference. Priorities in eyelid reconstruction are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">preserving eyelid function</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">developing a stable eyelid margin</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ensuring adequate eyelid closure for ocular protection</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">maintaining adequate vertical eyelid height</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">creating a smooth, epithelialized internal surface</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">maximizing cosmesis and symmetry</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following general princi&#173;ples guide the practice of eyelid reconstruction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5">One may reconstruct &#173;either the anterior or the posterior eyelid lamella, but not both, with a graft; 1 of the layers must provide a blood supply <span class="CharOverride-2">(pedicle flap).</span></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Direct the tension horizontally, while minimizing vertical tension.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Maintain sufficient and anatomical canthal fixation.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Match tissue similar in color and thickness to each other.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Minimize the defect area as much as pos&#173;si&#173;ble before sizing a graft.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-6">Request assistance from a subspecialist if necessary.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Eyelid Defects Not Involving the Eyelid Margin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Defects not involving the eyelid margins can be repaired by direct closure if the repair does not distort the eyelid margin. If undermining of the surrounding tissue does not allow direct closure, advancement or transposition of skin flaps may be used. The tension of closure should be directed horizontally, &#173;because vertical tension may cause eyelid retraction or ectropion. Vertical tension may be avoided by placement of vertically oriented incision lines.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the defect is too large to be closed primarily, techniques utilizing advancement or transposition of local skin flaps may be employed. The flaps most commonly used are rectangular advancement, rotation, and transposition. Flaps usually provide the best tissue match and aesthetic result, but they require planning in order to minimize secondary deformities. Upper eyelid skin is often an acceptable option for lower eyelid anterior lamellar defect repair. The final texture, contour, and cosmesis are typically better with flaps as compared to skin grafts from sites other than eyelid skin.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anterior lamella upper eyelid defects are best repaired with full-&#173;thickness skin grafts from the contralateral upper eyelid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-8</span>). Preauricular or postauricular skin grafts may be used, but their greater thickness may limit upper eyelid mobility. If flaps are not sufficient, lower eyelid defects are best filled with preauricular or postauricular skin grafts. If skin is not available from the upper eyelid or auricular areas, full-&#173;thickness grafts may be harvested from the supraclavicular fossa or the inner upper arm. Grafts should be slightly oversized, &#173;because contraction is likely to occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Use of split-&#173;thickness grafts should also be avoided in eyelid reconstruction. They are recommended only in the treatment of severe facial burns when adequate full-&#173;thickness skin is not available.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Eyelid Defects Involving the Eyelid Margin</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Small upper eyelid defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Small defects involving the upper eyelid margin can be repaired by primary closure if this technique does not place too much tension on the wound (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-9</span>). Primary closure is usually employed when one-&#173;third or less of the eyelid margin is involved; if a larger area is involved, advancement of adjacent tissue or grafting of distant tissue may be required. The superior limb of the lateral canthal tendon can be released to allow 3–5&#160;mm of medial mobilization of the remaining lateral eyelid margin. Care must be taken to avoid the lacrimal ductules in the lateral upper eyelid; removal or destruction of &#173;these ductules may lead to chronic dry eye prob&#173;lems in the patient. Postoperatively, the eyelid may appear tight and ptotic due to traction, but it typically relaxes over several weeks.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Moderate upper eyelid defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Moderate defects of the upper eyelid margin (33%–50% margin involvement) can be repaired by advancement of the lateral eyelid segment and temporal tissue. The lateral canthal tendon is released, and a semicircular skin flap is made below the lateral eyebrow extending from the canthus to allow for further eyelid mobilization. The temporal branch of the facial nerve should be avoided when incising the flap. Tarsal-&#173;sharing procedures involving the lower eyelid may be required in younger patients with less eyelid laxity.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Large upper eyelid defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Upper eyelid defects involving more than half of the upper eyelid margin are likely to require eyelid-&#173;sharing techniques. &#173;After a horizontal subciliary incision in the lower eyelid tarsus, a full-&#173;thickness lower eyelid flap is advanced into the defect of the upper eyelid &#173;behind the remaining lower eyelid margin (<span class="italic">Cutler-&#173;Beard flap</span>; Fig&#160;11-10). This procedure requires a second procedure to open the eyelids, and often results in a thick and relatively immobile upper eyelid. Alternatively, a tarsoconjunctival flap from the lower eyelid used in conjunction with an overlying skin graft may result in better cosmesis. Eyelid-&#173;sharing procedures are less optimal in monocular patients or in &#173;children in whom deprivation amblyopia may be a concern. A &#173;free tarsoconjunctival graft taken from the contralateral upper eyelid and covered with a skin–&#173;muscle flap may be an option if adequate redundant upper eyelid skin is pre&#173;sent.</p>
			<p class="h3">Small lower eyelid defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Small defects of the lower eyelid (margin involvement of less than one-&#173;third) can be repaired by primary closure (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-11</span>). In addition, the inferior crus of the lateral canthal tendon can be internally or externally released so that &#173;there is an additional 3–5&#160;mm of medial mobilization of the remaining lateral eyelid margin.</p>
			<p class="h3">Moderate lower eyelid defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Semicircular advancement or rotation flaps, which have been described for upper eyelid repair, can also be used for reconstruction of moderate defects in the lower eyelid. The most commonly used flap in such cases is a modification of the Tenzel semicircular rotation flap. Tarsoconjunctival autografts harvested from the underside of the upper eyelid may be transplanted into the lower eyelid defect for reconstruction of the posterior lamella of the eyelid. When tarsal grafts are harvested, the marginal 4–5&#160;mm height of the tarsus is preserved to prevent distortion of the donor eyelid margin. Tarsoconjunctival autografts may be covered with skin flaps or skin–&#173;muscle flaps. Cheek elevation (suborbicularis oculi fat lift) may be required to avoid ectropion and vertical traction on the eyelid. Alternatively, a tarsoconjunctival flap developed from the upper eyelid and a full-&#173;thickness skin graft can be used (discussed in the next subsection).</p>
			<p class="h3">Large lower eyelid defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Defects involving more than half of the lower eyelid margin can be repaired by advancement of a tarsoconjunctival flap from the upper eyelid into the posterior lamellar defect of the lower eyelid. The anterior lamella of the reconstructed eyelid is then created with an advancement skin flap or, in most cases, a &#173;free skin graft taken from the preauricular area, the postauricular area, or the contralateral upper eyelid <span class="italic">(modified Hughes flap).</span> The modified Hughes flap therefore results in placement of a bridge of conjunctiva from the upper eyelid across the pupil for several weeks (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-12</span>). The vascularized pedicle of conjunctiva is then released in a staged, second procedure once the lower eyelid flap is revascularized, typically 3–4 weeks &#173;later. Eyelid-&#173;sharing techniques should be used cautiously in &#173;children, &#173;because deprivation amblyopia may develop. Large rotating cheek flaps <span class="italic">(Mustard</span><span class="accent_italic">é</span> <span class="italic">flap;</span> Fig&#160;11-13<span class="italic">)</span> can work well for repair of large anterior lamellar defects, but they may require a tarsal substitute such as a &#173;free tarsoconjunctival autograft, hard-&#173;palate mucosa, or a Hughes flap for posterior lamella replacement. Both the cheek rotation flap and the semicircular rotation flap frequently result in a rounded lateral canthus, which can be mitigated by creating a very high incision &#173;toward the lateral end of the eyebrow, in which the incision emanates from the lateral commissure. &#173;Free tarsoconjunctival autografts from the upper eyelid covered with a vascularized skin flap have also been used to repair large defects. This type of procedure has the advantage of requiring only 1 surgical stage and prevents temporary occlusion of the visual axis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lateral Canthal Defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Laterally based transposition flaps of upper eyelid tarsus and conjunctiva can be used for large lower eyelid defects extending to the lateral canthus. &#173;These flaps can be covered with &#173;free skin grafts. Semicircular advancement or rhomboid flaps (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-14</span>) can also be used to repair defects extending to the lateral canthal area. Horizontal strips of periosteum and/or deep temporal fascia left attached at the lateral orbital rim can be swung over and attached to the remaining eyelid margins for reconstruction of the entire lateral canthal posterior lamella (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-15</span>). A Y-&#173;shaped pedicle flap of periosteum can be used for reconstruction of the entire lateral canthal posterior lamella of the upper and lower eyelids.</p>
			<p class="h2">Medial Canthal Defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The medial canthal area is typically repaired with full-&#173;thickness skin grafting (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-16</span>) or via vari&#173;ous flap techniques, although spontaneous granulation of anterior lamellar defects has demonstrated variable success. When full-&#173;thickness medial eyelid defects are pre&#173;sent, the medial canthal attachments of the remaining eyelid margin must be fixed to firm periosteum or bone. This fixation may be accomplished with heavy permanent suture, wire, or titanium miniplates. Defects involving the lacrimal drainage apparatus are more complex, requiring simultaneous microsurgical reconstruction and pos&#173;si&#173;ble lacrimal intubation or marsupialization. If extensive sacrifice of the canaliculi has occurred in the resection of a tumor, the patient may have to tolerate epiphora &#173;until tumor recurrence is deemed unlikely, &#173;after which a conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy can be considered (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;15</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Full-&#173;thickness skin grafts offer an excellent way to reconstruct the medial canthus compared with the cicatrix resulting from spontaneous granulation, and they are thin enough to allow for early detection of tumor recurrence. Frozen sections and wide margins or Mohs micrographic resection techniques should be performed at the time of initial tumor resection to minimize the risk of recurrent medial canthal tumors and the risk of orbital or lacrimal tumor extension. Large medial canthal defects of anterior lamellar structures may be properly reconstructed through the careful transposition of forehead or glabellar flaps. However, such flaps can have the disadvantage of being thick, thereby making early detection of recurrences difficult. In addition, they may require second-&#173;stage thinning or &#173;laser resurfacing to achieve the optimal cosmetic result. Mohs micrographic resection of tumors offers the highest cure rates for eradication of medial canthal epithelial malignancies.</p>
