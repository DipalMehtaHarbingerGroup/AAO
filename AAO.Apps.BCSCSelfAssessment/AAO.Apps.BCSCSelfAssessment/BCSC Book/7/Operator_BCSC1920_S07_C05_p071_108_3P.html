			<p class="h2-h1">Infantile (Capillary) Hemangioma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infantile (capillary) hemangiomas are common primary benign tumors of the orbit in &#173;children (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-1</span>). &#173;These lesions pre&#173;sent at birth or within the first few weeks of life. They enlarge dramatically over the first 6–12 months and begin to involute &#173;after the first year of life; 75% of lesions resolve by the age of 3–7&#160;years. Female sex, low birth weight, prematurity, and maternal chorionic villus sampling are associated with infantile hemangiomas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Congenital infantile hemangiomas may be superficial—in which case they involve the skin and appear as a bright red, soft mass with a dimpled texture—or they may be subcutaneous and bluish. Hemangiomas located deeper within the orbit may pre&#173;sent as a progressively enlarging mass without any overlying skin change. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help to distinguish infantile hemangiomas from other vascular malformations by demonstrating characteristic fine intralesional vascular channels and high blood flow. Color Doppler ultrasound imaging is a reliable and inexpensive imaging tool for diagnosing &#173;these lesions, often showing numerous blood vessels within the mass and abundant blood flow.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the periocular area, infantile hemangiomas occur most commonly in the superonasal quadrant of the orbit and the medial upper eyelid (see also the section&#160;Congenital Eyelid Lesions in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>). They may be associated with hemangiomas on other parts of the body; lesions that involve the neck can compromise the airway and lead to respiratory obstruction, and multiple large visceral lesions can produce thrombocytopenia <span class="italic">(Kasabach-&#173;Merritt syndrome).</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most lesions regress spontaneously, requiring only observation with refractive correction and amblyopia therapy. The main ocular complications of infantile hemangiomas are amblyopia, strabismus, and anisometropia. Although disruption of vision or severe disfigurement may require therapy, treatment can be deferred &#173;until it is clear that such complications may develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For infantile hemangiomas that require therapy, <span class="greek">β</span>-&#173;blockers are the first-&#173;line treatment. Topical timolol gel treats superficial tumors and has &#173;limited systemic adverse effects. Oral propranolol treats deeper lesions and offers fewer adverse effects than systemic ste&#173;roids, although life-&#173;threatening hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoglycemia can occur in rare instances. Oral <span class="greek">β</span>-&#173;blocker treatment should be initiated &#173;under the guidance of a pediatrician, so the patient can be monitored for systemic adverse effects. Lesions that do not respond adequately to <span class="greek">β</span>-&#173;blockers may require treatment with ste&#173;roids, administered topically, by local injection, or orally (see the section&#160;Congenital Eyelid Lesions in <span class="xref-local">Chap</span><span class="xref-local">ter&#160;10</span>). Adverse effects of ste&#173;roid injection include skin necrosis, subcutaneous fat atrophy, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal embolic vision loss. Ste&#173;roid treatment by any route in infants may produce hypothalamic-&#173;pituitary-&#173;adrenal axis suppression, systemic growth retardation, and a variety of other metabolic adverse effects.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgical excision with meticulous hemostasis may be considered for active-&#173;phase lesions refractory to ste&#173;roids or for some smaller or subcutaneous nodular lesions. Pulsed-&#173;dye &#173;laser therapy can improve superficial components of the hemangioma. Radiation therapy has also been used, but it can lead to cataract formation, bony hypoplasia, and &#173;future malignancy. Sclerosing solutions are not recommended, as they can cause severe scarring. Residual lesions that remain &#173;after involution or treatment can be removed surgically.</p>

			<p class="h2">Lymphatic Malformation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pure lymphatic malformations (LMs; previously called <span class="italic">lymphangiomas</span>) are low-&#173;flow orbital lesions resulting from disruption of the initially pluripotent vascular anlage, which leads to aberrant development and congenital malformation. LMs can also occur in the conjunctiva (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-2A</span>), eyelids, oropharynx (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-2B</span>), or sinuses. In the orbit, LMs usually become apparent in the first or second de&#173;cade of life. They can be described as <span class="italic">macrocystic</span> (cysts <span class="symbol">≥</span>2&#160;cm), <span class="italic">microcystic</span> (cysts <span class="symbol">≤</span>2&#160;cm), or <span class="italic">mixed macrocystic/microcystic</span>. LMs cannot be decompressed and do not distend with a Valsalva maneuver. However, they may enlarge during upper respiratory tract infections, and they may pre&#173;sent with sudden proptosis caused by spontaneous intralesional hemorrhage <span class="italic">(choco&#173;late cysts).</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">The natu&#173;ral history of LMs is variable; some are localized and pro&#173;gress slowly, whereas &#173;others may diffusely infiltrate orbital structures and enlarge inexorably. MRI may show pathognomonic features (multiple grapelike cystic lesions with fluid–&#173;fluid layering of serum and red blood cells), confirming the diagnosis (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-2C</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">LMs are characterized by their hemodynamic properties, and classification schemes continue to evolve. Some LMs possess a significant venous flow component and have clinical characteristics that overlap with venous malformations (VMs, discussed &#173;later in this chapter); &#173;these lesions are termed <span class="italic">combined lymphatic venous malformations</span>. Treatment depends on the hemodynamic flow characteristics of the lesion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologically, pure LMs are characterized by serum-&#173;filled channels lined by flat endothelial cells that have immunostaining patterns consistent with lymphatic capillaries. Scattered follicles of lymphoid tissues are found in the interstitium. &#173;These lesions have an infiltrative pattern and are not encapsulated.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of LM is challenging for several reasons: the vascular channels are typically not amenable to endovascular approaches, the infiltrative nature of the lesion often involves vital orbital structures, significant hemorrhage may occur during surgery, and recurrence is common. Observation is a reasonable approach for lesions that are asymptomatic and not amblyogenic. If treatment is warranted, debulking of the lesion combined with use of intralesional sclerosing agents, &#173;either percutaneous or intraoperatively, may be successful. Sclerosants include morrhuate sodium, bleomycin (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-2D</span>), polidocanol, OK-432, thrombosing agents such as fibrin glue, and embolizing agents such as cyanoacrylate glues and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Acute hemorrhage complicated by optic neuropathy or corneal ulceration may respond to ultrasound-&#173;guided aspiration of blood through a hollow-&#173;bore needle or by open surgical exploration. While mild hematomas may resolve spontaneously, the mass effect of such hemorrhages can persist due to bleeding within dead-&#173;end lymphatic channels.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Noncontiguous intracranial vascular malformations have been reported to occur in up to 25% of patients with orbital LMs. &#173;These lesions have a low rate of spontaneous hemorrhage and are not treated prophylactically.</p>
			<p class="h2">Distensible Venous Malformation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Distensible venous malformations of the orbit, previously known as <span class="italic">orbital varices</span>, are low-&#173;flow lesions that enlarge with a Valsalva maneuver. Patients may exhibit enophthalmos at rest, when the lesion is not engorged. Proptosis that increases when the patient’s head is dependent or &#173;after a Valsalva maneuver suggests the presence of a venous malformation (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-3A, C</span>). Apart from the inducible proptosis, the ophthalmic examination is often unremarkable, with symmetric intraocular pressures (IOPs), lack of conjunctival vessel engorgement, and no reflux of blood in the Schlemm canal. The diagnosis can be confirmed with imaging such as MRI (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-3D</span>) or contrast-&#173;enhanced rapid spiral computed tomography (CT) during a Valsalva maneuver or other means of decreasing venous return; cases show characteristic enlargement of the engorged veins. Phleboliths may be pre&#173;sent on imaging.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Management is usually conservative, with observation of relatively asymptomatic lesions. Biopsy should be avoided &#173;because of the risk of hemorrhage. Surgery is reserved for patients who have significant pain or in whom the malformation &#173;causes vision-&#173;threatening compressive optic neuropathy. Complete surgical excision is difficult, as &#173;these lesions often intertwine with normal orbital structures and directly communicate with the abundant &#173;venous reservoir in the cavernous sinus. Treatment of highly symptomatic lesions typically consists of combined embolization and excision. Sclerosants, injected &#173;either percutaneously or directly through an open approach, are an additional treatment option. However, orbital compartment syndrome may occur, requiring urgent decompression.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cavernous Venous Malformation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cavernous venous malformations (CVMs) are nondistensible, low-&#173;flow vascular lesions previously known as <span class="italic">cavernous hemangiomas</span>. They are the most common type of primary orbital lesion in adults, typically presenting in the fourth and fifth de&#173;cades of life. &#173;Women represent 60% of cases, and circulating estrogen and progesterone levels may play a role in clinical progression, with growth sometimes accelerating during pregnancy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CVMs typically produce slowly progressive, painless proptosis (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-4A</span>). Other findings may include ret&#173;i&#173;nal striae, hyperopia, optic nerve compression, increased IOP, and strabismus. Contrast-&#173;enhanced orbital imaging shows a stippled pattern in the early phase of contrast that develops into homogeneous staining in the late phase. The lesion appears as a well-&#173;circumscribed mass that can have an intraconal and/or extraconal component (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-4B, C</span>). Chronic lesions may contain radiodense phleboliths. Arteriography and venography typically do not aid in the diagnosis as &#173;these lesions have very &#173;limited communication with the systemic circulation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">On histologic examination, CVMs are encapsulated and composed of large cavernous spaces with walls of smooth muscle containing red blood cells.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment consists of complete surgical excision if the lesion compromises visual function, &#173;causes significant proptosis, or demonstrates substantial growth. The growth potential of a CVM is not predictable at the time of diagnosis or following incomplete resection; in rare cases, &#173;these lesions may involute spontaneously.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because they are encapsulated and relatively isolated from the surrounding tissue, CVMs are often easier to remove than many other orbital tumors. Coronal imaging helps determine the position of the CVM relative to the optic nerve, and the surgical approach is dictated by the location of the lesion. Deeper lesions may be attached to vital (and sometimes vascular) structures within the orbital apex, so their complete excision may not always warrant the risks. Radiotherapy can be considered for lesions located deep within the orbital apex.</p>

			<p class="h2">Arteriovenous Malformation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are high-&#173;flow developmental anomalies that, like venous malformations, result from vascular dysgenesis. They are characterized by rapid arterial flow through the nidus into the draining venous circulation and often occur at choke anastomotic zones. Dilated corkscrew episcleral vessels and pulsatile proptosis may be pre&#173;sent, and vascular steal or shunting from the orbit may produce ischemic changes. Noninvasive imaging supports the diagnosis, with CT revealing diffuse enhancement and MRI showing flow voids (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">AVMs gradually enlarge as they recruit more arterial feeders. They often require treatment, which involves preoperative selective angiography with embolization followed by resection of the nidus. Failure to completely resect the nidus may allow recurrence; however, complete resection of the nidus may not be pos&#173;si&#173;ble without significant morbidity. Exsanguinating arterial hemorrhage can occur with surgical intervention, especially in unsuspected lesions without preoperative embolization.</p>
			<p class="h2">Arteriovenous Fistula</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Arteriovenous fistulas are acquired lesions characterized by abnormal direct communication between an artery and a vein without flow through an intervening capillary bed. An arteriovenous fistula may be caused by trauma or degeneration. &#173;There are 2 forms, direct and indirect (dural). <span class="italic">Direct carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas</span> are characterized by a connection between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus; they typically occur &#173;after trauma that creates a tear or hole in a branch artery of the internal carotid within the cavernous sinus. They may also be caused iatrogenically, for example, during neurosurgical or neuroradiologic procedures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Direct carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas possess high blood flow and may produce characteristic tortuous epibulbar vessels, as well as pulsatile proptosis and an audible bruit. Ischemic ocular damage results from diversion of arterialized blood into the venous system, which &#173;causes venous outflow obstruction (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-6A</span>). This in turn leads to elevated IOP, choroidal effusions, blood in the Schlemm canal, and nongranulomatous anterior uveitis. Ocular motility abnormalities can result from &#173;either congestion within the orbit or increased pressure in the cavernous sinus. The latter can cause compression of cranial nerves III, IV, or, most commonly, VI, with associated extraocular muscle palsies. CT scans may show diffuse enlargement of some or all of the extraocular muscles resulting from venous engorgement and a characteristically enlarged superior ophthalmic vein (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-6B, C</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Indirect (dural) carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas</span> are characterized by a connection between meningeal branches of the internal and/or external carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. &#173;These fistulas most commonly develop as a degenerative pro&#173;cess in older patients with systemic hypertension, vascular disease, and/or atherosclerosis. &#173;Because dural fistulas generally have lower rates of blood flow than direct carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas, their onset can be insidious, with only mild orbital congestion, proptosis, and pain. Arterialization of the conjunctival veins &#173;causes chronic red eye. Increased episcleral venous pressure results in asymmetric elevation of IOP on the affected side, and patients with chronic fistulas are at risk for glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve head.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may be helpful in diagnosing arteriovenous fistulas, with fewer associated adverse effects than conventional angiography (eg, stroke). However, conventional angiography possesses more sensitivity than MRA and remains the gold standard for diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The decision to treat an arteriovenous fistula is based on weighing the severity of symptoms against the risks associated with intervention. &#173;Because they are high-&#173;flow lesions, direct carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas usually require intervention. Small indirect carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas often close spontaneously and may initially be observed. However, &#173;because even &#173;these lesions may result in intracranial hemorrhage, some investigators have recommended more aggressive management of indirect fistulas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intervention typically involves an endovascular treatment (coils or glue) to block the fistula (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-7</span>). Transvenous access is used to reach dural fistulas, while direct carotid-&#173;cavernous fistulas are generally treated via a transarterial approach. Occasionally, a transvenous approach by transcutaneous canalization of the superior ophthalmic vein is employed for embolization, which may require an orbitotomy to directly access the vein.</p>

			<p class="h2">Orbital Hemorrhage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An orbital hemorrhage may result from trauma, surgery, or spontaneous bleeding from vascular malformations (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-8</span>). In rare instances, a spontaneous hemorrhage may be caused by a sudden increase in venous pressure (eg, due to a Valsalva maneuver). A spontaneous orbital hemorrhage almost always occurs in the superior subperiosteal space. It should be allowed to resorb &#173;unless &#173;there is associated visual compromise, in which case urgent drainage is indicated. Also see the section&#160;Orbital Compartment Syndrome in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;6</span>.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Neural Tumors</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The neural tumors that may involve the orbit include optic nerve gliomas, neurofibromas, meningiomas, and schwannomas.</p>
			<p class="h2">Optic Nerve Glioma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optic nerve gliomas are uncommon, usually benign tumors that occur predominantly in &#173;children in the first de&#173;cade of life (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-9</span>). The chief clinical feature is gradual, painless, unilateral axial proptosis associated with vision loss and an afferent pupillary defect. Other ocular findings may include optic atrophy, optic nerve head swelling, nystagmus, and strabismus. The chiasm is involved in roughly half of cases of optic nerve glioma. Intracranial involvement may be associated with intracranial hypertension as well as decreased function of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Up to half of optic nerve gliomas are associated with neurofibromatosis (NF). In patients with NF, the gliomas often proliferate in the subarachnoid space, while &#173;those occurring in patients without NF usually expand within the optic nerve substance without invading the dura mater.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Optic nerve gliomas can usually be diagnosed by means of orbital imaging. CT and MRI typically show fusiform enlargement of the optic nerve, often with ste&#173;reo&#173;typical kinking of the nerve. MRI may also show cystic degeneration, if pre&#173;sent, and may be more accurate than CT in defining the extent of an optic canal lesion and intracranial disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because neuroimaging is frequently diagnostic, it is usually unnecessary to perform a biopsy of a suspected lesion. Moreover, obtaining tissue from an appropriate site may be challenging: biopsy of the optic nerve itself may produce additional loss of visual field or vision, while a specimen from a too-&#173;peripheral portion of the nerve may inadvertently capture reactive meningeal hyperplasia adjacent to the glioma and lead to a misdiagnosis of fibrous meningioma. Gross pathology of resected tumors reveals a smooth, fusiform intradural lesion. On microscopic examination, benign tumors in &#173;children are considered to be juvenile pilocytic (hairlike) astrocytomas. Other histologic findings include arachnoid hyperplasia, mucosubstance, and Rosenthal fibers (see the discussion of the pathologic features of glioma in BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Malignant optic nerve gliomas (glioblastomas)</span> are very rare and tend to affect adult males. Initial signs and symptoms of malignant gliomas include severe retro-&#173;orbital pain, unilateral or bilateral vision loss, and, typically, massive swelling and hemorrhage of the optic nerve head (pallor may also be observed with posterior lesions). Despite treatment, including high-&#173;dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy, &#173;these tumors usually result in death within 6–12 months.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The treatment of nonmalignant optic nerve gliomas is controversial. Although most cases remain stable or pro&#173;gress very slowly, leading some authors to consider them benign hamartomas, the occasional case behaves aggressively. &#173;There are rare reports of spontaneous regression of optic nerve and visual pathway gliomas. Cystic enlargement of the lesions leading to sudden vision loss can occur even without true cellular growth. A treatment plan must be carefully individualized for each patient. &#173;Factors affecting therapeutic decisions include the tumor’s growth characteristics, extent of optic nerve and chiasmal involvement as determined by clinical and radiographic evaluation, vision in the involved and uninvolved eyes, presence or absence of concomitant neurologic or systemic disease, and history of previous treatment. The following options may be considered.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Observation only</span> Presumed optic nerve glioma, particularly with good vision on the involved side, may be carefully followed if the radiographic evidence is characteristic of this type of tumor and the glioma is confined to the orbit. &#173;Because visual function does not directly correlate with glioma size or growth, follow-up should include precise mea&#173;sure&#173;ments of optic nerve function in addition to serial imaging studies. Many patients maintain good vision and never require surgery.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Surgical excision</span> Rapid intraorbital tumor growth may prompt surgical resection in an effort to isolate the tumor from the optic chiasm and thus prevent chiasmal invasion. To obtain tumor-&#173;free surgical margins, the surgeon uses a transcranial approach. Surgical excision of a tumor confined to the orbit may also be considered if it &#173;causes severe proptosis with corneal exposure or unacceptable cosmesis. Removal through an intracranial approach may also be indicated at the time of initial diagnosis or &#173;after a short period of observation if the tumor involves the prechiasmal intracranial portion of the optic nerve. Complete excision is pos&#173;si&#173;ble if the tumor ends 2–3&#160;mm anterior to the chiasm.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Chemotherapy</span> Combination chemotherapy using dactinomycin, vincristine, etoposide, and other agents has been reported to be effective in patients with progressive chiasmal-&#173;hypothalamic gliomas. Chemotherapy may delay the need for radiation therapy and thus reduce deleterious effects on long-&#173;term intellectual development and endocrine function in &#173;children. However, chemotherapy may carry long-&#173;term risks of blood-&#173;borne cancers.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Radiation therapy</span> Radiation therapy is typically considered if the tumor cannot be resected (usually lesions of the chiasm or optic tract) and if symptoms, particularly neurologic, pro&#173;gress &#173;after chemotherapy. It may also be considered &#173;after surgical excision if reliable radiographic studies document subsequent growth of the tumor in the chiasm or if chiasmal and optic tract involvement is extensive. &#173;Because of potentially debilitating adverse effects (including intellectual disability, growth retardation, secondary tumors, and malignant transformation within the radiation field), radiation is generally reserved as a last resort for &#173;children who have not completed growth and development.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neurofibromas are tumors composed chiefly of proliferating Schwann cells within the nerve sheaths.

			<p class="h2">Meningioma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Meningiomas are invasive tumors that arise from the arachnoid villi. Orbital meningiomas usually originate intracranially along the sphenoid wing, with secondary extension through the bone into the orbit (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-11</span>), the superior orbital fissure, or the optic canal; or they may arise primarily in the orbital portion of the optic nerve sheath. Ophthalmic manifestations are related to the location of the primary tumor. Meningiomas arising near the sella and optic nerve cause early visual field defects and optic nerve edema or optic atrophy. Tumors arising near the pterion (the posterior end of the parietosphenoid fissure, at the lateral portion of the sphenoid bone) often produce a mass in the temporal fossa and may be associated with proptosis or nonaxial displacement of the globe (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-11A, B</span>). Eyelid edema (especially of the lower eyelid) and chemosis are common. Interestingly, although primary optic nerve sheath meningiomas can, in rare cases, produce axial proptosis with preserved vision, depending on their anatomic location, some meningiomas can cause early profound vision loss without any proptosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sphenoid wing meningiomas produce hyperostosis of the involved bone (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-11C</span>) and hyperplasia of associated soft tissues. Contrast-&#173;enhanced MRI helps define the extent of meningiomas along the dura (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-11D</span>). The presence of a <span class="italic">dural tail</span> (reactive thickening of the dura adjacent to the meningioma) helps distinguish a meningioma from fibrous dysplasia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Primary orbital meningiomas usually originate in the arachnoid of the optic nerve sheath. They occur most commonly in &#173;women in their third or fourth de&#173;cade of life. Symptoms usually include a gradual, painless, unilateral loss of vision. Examination typically shows decreased vision and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Proptosis and ophthalmoplegia may also be pre&#173;sent. The optic nerve head may appear normal, atrophic, or swollen; and tortuous vessels may be vis&#173;i&#173;ble (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-12A, B</span>). Occasionally, optic nerve sheath meningiomas are pre&#173;sent bilaterally, or meningiomas occur ectopically in the orbit; &#173;these are associated with neurofibromatosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Optic nerve sheath meningiomas can usually be diagnosed by means of imaging characteristics. Both CT and MRI show diffuse tubular enlargement of the optic nerve with contrast enhancement (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-12C, D</span>). In some cases, CT can show calcification within the meningioma, referred to as <span class="italic">tram-&#173;tracking</span>. MRI reveals a fine pattern of enhancing striations emanating from the lesion in a longitudinal fashion. &#173;These striations represent the infiltrative nature of what other&#173;wise appears to be an encapsulated lesion. As with sphenoid wing meningiomas, dural extension through the optic canal into the intracranial space can be seen on MRI.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Malignant meningioma</span> is rare and results in rapid tumor growth that is not responsive to surgical resection, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. On histologic examination, malignant meningiomas are indistinguishable from the more common benign group.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Sphenoid wing meningioma</span> Sphenoid wing meningiomas are typically observed &#173;until they cause functional deficits, such as profound proptosis, compressive optic neuropathy, motility impairment, or ce&#173;re&#173;bral edema. Treatment includes resection of the tumor through a combined approach to the intracranial and orbital component. Complete surgical resection is not always practical &#173;because of tumor extension beyond the surgical field. Rather, the goal of surgery is to reverse the volume-&#173;induced compressive effects of the lesion. Postoperative radiotherapy may be used to reduce the risk of further growth and spread of the residual tumor, or patients can be followed clinically and with serial MRI scans.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Optic nerve sheath meningioma</span> Treatment of optic nerve sheath meningiomas in the orbit also must be individualized. Both the amount of vision loss and the presence of intracranial extension are impor&#173;tant &#173;factors in treatment planning. Observation is indicated if vision is minimally affected and no intracranial extension is pre&#173;sent. If the tumor is confined to the orbit and vision loss is significant or progressive, radiation therapy should be considered. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy often results in stabilization or improvement of visual function. If the patient is observed or treated with radiation, periodic MRI examination is used to carefully monitor for pos&#173;si&#173;ble posterior or intracranial extension. With rare exceptions, attempts to surgically excise optic nerve sheath meningiomas result in irreversible vision loss due to compromise of the optic nerve blood supply. Thus, surgery is reserved for patients with severe vision loss and profound proptosis. In such cases, the optic nerve is excised with the tumor, from the back of the globe to the chiasm, if preoperative MRI suggests that complete resection is pos&#173;si&#173;ble.</p>

			<p class="h2">Schwannoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Schwannomas, sometimes known as <span class="italic">neurilemomas,</span> are proliferations of Schwann cells that are encapsulated by perineurium. &#173;These tumors have a characteristic biphasic pattern of solid areas with nuclear palisading <span class="italic">(Antoni A pattern)</span> and myxoid areas <span class="italic">(Antoni B pattern).</span> &#173;These tumors are usually well encapsulated and can be excised with relative ease.

			<div id="Chapt5_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Rhabdomyosarcoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common primary orbital malignancy of childhood. The average age of onset is 5–7&#160;years. The classic clinical picture is that of a child with sudden onset and rapid progression of unilateral proptosis. However, patients in their early teens may experience a less dramatic course, with gradually progressive proptosis developing over weeks to more than a month. &#173;There is often a marked adnexal response with edema and discoloration of the eyelids. Ptosis and strabismus may also be pre&#173;sent. A mass may be palpable, particularly in the superonasal quadrant of the eyelid, and it may cause proptosis if sufficiently large (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-13A, B</span>). However, the tumor may be retrobulbar, may involve any quadrant of the orbit, and may in rare cases arise from the conjunctiva. If the patient has an unrelated history of trauma to the orbital area, this can lead to a delay in diagnosis and treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If a rhabdomyosarcoma is suspected, the workup should proceed urgently. CT and MRI can be used to define the location and extent of the tumor (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-13C</span>). A biopsy should be performed, usually through an anterior orbitotomy approach (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-13D</span>). If the lesion is focal and has a pseudocapsule, it may be pos&#173;si&#173;ble to completely remove the tumor. If this is not practical, &#173;there is some indication that the smaller the volume of residual tumor, the more effective is the combination of adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy in achieving a cure. In diffusely infiltrating rhabdomyosarcoma, a large biopsy specimen should be obtained to provide adequate tissue for frozen sections, permanent light-&#173;microscopy sections, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Cross-&#173;striations are often not vis&#173;i&#173;ble on light microscopy and may be more readily apparent on electron microscopy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The physician should palpate the cervical and preauricular lymph nodes of a patient with orbital rhabdomyosarcoma to evaluate for regional metastases. Chest radiography, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, and lumbar puncture should be performed to search for more distant metastases. Sampling of the bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid is best performed, if pos&#173;si&#173;ble, with the patient &#173;under anesthesia at the time of the initial orbital biopsy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Rhabdomyosarcomas arise from undifferentiated pluripotent mesenchymal ele&#173;ments in the orbital soft tissues, not from the extraocular muscles. They may be grouped into the following 4 categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Embryonal.</span> This is by far the most common type, accounting for more than 80% of cases. The embryonal form is typically found in the superonasal quadrant of the orbit. The tumor is composed of loose fascicles of undifferentiated spindle cells, only a minority of which show cross-&#173;striations in immature rhabdomyosarcomas on trichrome staining. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas are associated with a good 5-&#173;year survival rate (94%).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Alveolar.</span> This form typically occurs in the inferior orbit and accounts for 9% of orbital rhabdomyosarcomas. The tumor displays regular compartments composed of fibrovascular strands in which rounded rhabdomyoblasts &#173;either line up along the connective tissue strands or float freely in the alveolar spaces. This is the most malignant form of rhabdomyosarcoma; the 5-&#173;year survival rate for the alveolar subtype is 65%.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Pleomorphic.</span> Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma is the least common and best-&#173;differ&#173;entiated form overall, most frequently affecting young adults. In this type, many of the cells are strap&#173;like or rounded, and cross-&#173;striations are easily visualized with trichrome stain. The pleomorphic variety has the best prognosis (5-&#173;year survival rate of 97%).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Botryoid.</span> This rare variant of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma appears grapelike. It is not found in the orbit as a primary tumor; rather, the botryoid variant occurs only through secondary extension from the paranasal sinuses or the conjunctiva. Rhabdomyosarcoma that occurs in the head and neck region outside the orbit, including the sinus cavities, has a lower 5-&#173;year survival rate (50%–71%) than rhabdomyosarcoma in the orbit, likely &#173;because tumors in the head and neck region produce fewer signs and symptoms.<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-3">Crist&#160;W, Gehan&#160;EA, Ragab&#160;AH, et&#160;al. The Third Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study. <span class="reference--journal-_italic">J&#160;Clin Oncol.</span> 1995;13(3):610–630.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before 1965, the standard treatment for orbital rhabdomyosarcoma was orbital exenteration, and the survival rate was poor. &#173;After 1965, radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy became the mainstays of primary treatment, based on the guidelines set forth by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group. Exenteration is reserved for recurrent cases. The total dose of local radiation varies from 4500 to 6000 cGy, given over a period of 6 weeks. The goal of systemic chemotherapy is to eliminate microscopic cellular metastases. With radiation and chemotherapy, survival rates are better than 90% if the orbital tumor has not invaded or extended beyond the bony orbital walls. Adverse effects of radiation are common in &#173;children and include cataract, radiation dermatitis, and bony hypoplasia if orbital development has not been completed.</p>

			<p class="h2">Miscellaneous Mesenchymal Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tumors of fibrous connective tissue, cartilage, and bone are uncommon lesions that may involve the orbit. It is likely that a number of &#173;these mesenchymal tumors &#173;were classified incorrectly before the availability of immunohistochemical staining, which has allowed them to be differentiated accurately.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Fibrous histiocytoma</span> is the most common of &#173;these tumors. Characteristically, it is very firm and displaces normal structures. Both fibroblastic and histiocytic cells in a storiform (matlike) pattern are found in &#173;these locally aggressive tumors. Less than 10% have metastatic potential. This tumor is sometimes difficult to distinguish, clinically and histologically, from a solitary fibrous tumor.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">A solitary fibrous tumor</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-14</span>) is composed of spindle-&#173;shaped cells that are strongly positive for CD34 and STAT 6 on immunohistochemical studies. &#173;These lesions, some of which &#173;were previously termed <span class="italic">hemangiopericytomas</span>, are uncommon, encapsulated, hypervascular, and hypercellular; they often appear in midlife. They can occur anywhere in the orbit; and they may recur, undergo malignant degeneration, or metastasize if incompletely excised. They may resemble cavernous hemangiomas on both CT and MRI, but they appear bluish intraoperatively. On histologic examination, &#173;these tumors are unique in that microscopically “benign” lesions may recur and metastasize, whereas microscopically “malignant” lesions may remain localized. Treatment consists of complete excision.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Fibrous dysplasia</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-15</span>) is a benign developmental disorder of bone that may involve a single region or be polyostotic. CT shows hyperostotic bone, and MRI shows the lack of dural enhancement that distinguishes this condition from meningioma. When associated with cutaneous pigmentation and endocrine disorders, the condition is known as <span class="italic">Albright syndrome.</span> Resection or debulking is performed when the lesion &#173;causes disfigurement or vision loss due to stricture of the optic canal.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Osteomas</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-16</span>) are benign tumors that can involve any of the periorbital sinuses. CT scans show dense hyperostosis with well-&#173;defined margins. The lesions can produce prop&#173;tosis, compressive optic neuropathy, and orbital cellulitis secondary to obstructive sinusitis. Most are incidental, slow-&#173;growing lesions that require no treatment. Complete excision is advised when the tumor is symptomatic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Malignant mesenchymal tumors such as <span class="italic">liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma,</span> and <span class="italic">osteosarcoma</span> rarely appear in the orbit. When chondrosarcomas and osteosarcomas are pre&#173;sent, they usually destroy normal bone and demonstrate characteristic calcifications in radiographs and CT scans. &#173;Children with a history of bilateral retinoblastoma are at higher risk for osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, or fibrosarcoma, even if they have not been treated with therapeutic radiation.</p>

			<div id="Chapt5_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Lymphoid Hyperplasia and Lymphoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lymphoproliferative lesions of the ocular adnexa constitute a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that are defined by clinical, histologic, immunologic, molecular, and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic characteristics. Lymphoproliferative neoplasms account for more than 20% of all orbital tumors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The vast majority of orbital lymphoproliferative lesions are non-&#173;Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In the United States, the incidence of NHL in all anatomic sites has been increasing, and it is one of the most common malignancies affecting the orbit. Workers with long-&#173;term exposure to bioactive solvents and reagents are at increased risk for NHL, as are older adults and individuals with chronic autoimmune diseases.</p>
			<p class="h3">Identification and classification of lymphoproliferative disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Non-&#173;Hodgkin lymphoma encompasses a heterogeneous group of malignancies and includes many subtypes. The Revised European-&#173;American Lymphoma Classification applies immunophenotypic and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic features to identify distinct clinicopathologic NHL entities, including extranodal sites such as the orbit. The World Health Organ&#173;ization’s classification elaborates on this approach. Orbital extranodal disease appears to represent a biological continuum and behaves unpredictably. By molecular ge&#173;ne&#173;tic studies, approximately 90% of orbital lymphoproliferative disease is monoclonal, and 10% is polyclonal; however, both types of lesions may involve prior, concurrent, or &#173;future systemic spread. Approximately 20%–30% of periocular lymphoproliferative lesions have a history of previous or concomitant systemic disease, and an additional 30% develop it over 5&#160;years. The risk of systemic disease remains elevated for de&#173;cades &#173;after the original lesion is diagnosed, regardless of the initial lesion’s location in the orbit or its clonality.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The risk of having or developing systemic NHL is lowest for conjunctival lesions, greater for orbital lesions, and highest for lesions arising in the eyelid. Lymphoid lesions developing in the fossa of the lacrimal gland may carry a greater risk of systemic disease than &#173;those occurring elsewhere in the orbit. Bilateral periocular involvement markedly increases the risk of systemic disease, but such involvement is not definitive evidence of systemic disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most orbital lymphomas are derived from B cells (98%). T-&#173;cell lymphoma is rare and more lethal. B-&#173;cell lymphoma is divided into Hodgkin and non-&#173;Hodgkin tumors, with the former rarely metastasizing to the orbit. The 4 most common types of orbital lymphomas are presented in order below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Extranodal marginal zone B-&#173;cell lymphoma, EMZL</span> (also known as <span class="bullet-list_italic">mucosa-&#173;associated </span><span class="bullet-list_italic">lymphoid tissue,</span> or <span class="bullet-list_italic">MALT</span>). EMZL accounts for approximately 57% of orbital lymphomas and is associated with upregulation of nuclear &#173;factor <span class="bullet-list_greek">κ</span>B (NF-&#173;<span class="bullet-list_greek">κ</span>B). NF-&#173;<span class="bullet-list_greek">κ</span>B is a major transcription &#173;factor that is involved in the innate and adaptive immunologic system. Inactivating mutations in the <span class="bullet-list_italic">A20</span> gene, an inhibitor of NF-&#173;<span class="bullet-list_greek">κ</span>B, have also been noted in cases of EMZL. In the gastrointestinal tract, EMZL has been associated with <span class="bullet-list_italic">Helicobacter pylori</span> in gastric lymphomas where antimicrobial therapy has been shown to be effective. EMZL has been weakly associated with chlamydial infection, and antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended.<p class="bullet-list-cont _idGenParaOverride-1">EMZLs are low-&#173;grade malignancies, and 5%–15% of cases undergo spontaneous remission. However, systemic disease develops in at least 50% of patients at 10&#160;years, and 15%–20% of cases undergo histologic transformation to a higher-&#173;grade lesion, usually of a large cell type. Such transformation usually occurs &#173;after several years and is not related to therapy.</p></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Diffuse large B-&#173;cell lymphoma (DLBCL)</span> comprises 15% of orbital lymphomas. DLBCL also occurs in vari&#173;ous intraocular compartments. It has been associated with multiple chromosomal translocations and alterations in the <span class="bullet-list_italic">BCL2, BCL6, MYC, EZH2, </span>and<span class="bullet-list_italic"> MEF2B</span> genes.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Follicular lymphoma (FL)</span>. This type of lymphoma represents a low-&#173;grade lesion with follicular centers and is the third-&#173;most-&#173;common orbital lymphoma (11%). The most common translocation associated with FL is t(14;18)(q32;q21), which results in high levels of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2.</li>

			<p class="h3">Clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The typical lymphoproliferative lesion pre&#173;sents as a gradually progressive, painless mass, resulting in proptosis, a vis&#173;i&#173;ble periocular mass, or ptosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-17</span>). &#173;These tumors are often located anteriorly in the orbit or beneath the conjunctiva, where they may show the typical salmon-&#173;patch appearance (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-18</span>). Lymphoproliferative lesions, &#173;whether benign or malignant, usually mold to surrounding orbital structures rather than invading them; consequently, disturbances of extraocular motility or visual function are unusual. Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and low-&#173;grade lymphomas often have a history of slow expansion over a period of months to years. Regional lymph nodes should be palpated during the clinical examination.</p>
			<p class="h3">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital imaging reveals a characteristic puttylike molding of the tumor to normal structures (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-17B</span>). Bone erosion or infiltration is usually not seen except with high-&#173;grade malignant lymphomas. Up to 50% of orbital lymphoproliferative lesions arise in the fossa of the lacrimal gland. Lymphomas in the retrobulbar fat may appear more infiltrative. Approximately 17% of orbital lymphoid lesions occur bilaterally, but this does not necessarily indicate the presence of extraorbital disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For all lymphoproliferative lesions, an open biopsy is preferred to obtain an adequate tissue specimen. A portion of the tissue should be placed in a suitable fixative for light micro&#173;scopy, and the majority should be sent fresh to a molecular diagnostics laboratory for pos&#173;si&#173;ble flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and genomic analy&#173;sis. Fine-&#173;needle aspiration biopsy may establish all but the morphologic characteristics of the lesion. Conjunctival biopsy for follicular conjunctivitis can sometimes reveal a lymphoproliferative lesion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Both reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and malignant lymphoma are hypercellular proliferations with sparse or absent stromal components. Light microscopy may reveal a histologic continuum from reactive lymphoid hyperplasia to low-&#173;grade lymphoma to higher-&#173;grade malignancy; it may not by itself adequately characterize a given lesion. In such cases, immunopathology and molecular diagnostic studies aid in further categorization.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Malignant lymphomas</span> are thought to represent clonal expansions of abnormal precursor cells. Immunologic identification of lymphocyte cell-&#173;surface markers can classify tumors as containing B cells or T cells. Specific monoclonal antibodies directed against surface light-&#173;chain immunoglobulins are used to determine &#173;whether the cells represent monoclonal (ie, malignant) proliferations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic analy&#173;sis has shown that most lymphoproliferative lesions that appear to be immunologically polyclonal actually harbor small monoclonal proliferations of B lymphocytes. However, the finding of monoclonality, by &#173;either immunophenotype or molecular ge&#173;ne&#173;tics, does not predict which tumors &#173;will ultimately result in systemic disease.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because &#173;there is considerable overlap among the vari&#173;ous lymphoproliferative lesions in terms of clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion and be&#173;hav&#173;ior, all patients with hypercellular lymphoid lesions (&#173;whether monoclonal or polyclonal) should be examined by an oncologist. Depending on the histologic type of the lesion, the examination may include a general physical examination, a complete blood count, a bone marrow biopsy, CT and/or MRI imaging, a positron emission tomography scan, and serum immunoprotein electrophoresis. The patient should be reexamined periodically &#173;because systemic lymphoma may develop many years &#173;after the occurrence of an isolated orbital lymphoid neoplasm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For EMZL and FL, radiotherapy usually results in good outcomes, with 10-&#173;year survival rates of 92% and 71%, respectively. DLBCL and MCL have a poorer prognosis, with 10-&#173;year survival rates of 41% and 32%, respectively. Treatment of non-&#173;EMZL more often involves chemotherapy and immunomodulation in addition to radiotherapy. The optimal dose of radiation has not been established, with published amounts ranging from 20–40&#160;Gy&#160;in fractionated doses. A surgical cure is usually not pos&#173;si&#173;ble &#173;because of the infiltrative nature of lymphoid tumors. Alternative treatments include targeted therapies such as rituximab for CD20-&#173;positive lymphomas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The management of low-&#173;grade lymphoid lesions that have already under&#173;gone systemic dissemination is somewhat controversial, &#173;because indolent lymphomas are generally refractory to chemotherapy and are associated with long-&#173;term survival, even if untreated. Many oncologists take a watchful waiting approach and treat only symptomatic disease.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Plasma Cell Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lesions composed predominantly of mature plasma cells may be plasmacytomas or localized plasma cell–&#173;rich masses. Multiple myeloma should be ruled out, particularly if &#173;there is bone destruction or any immaturity or mitotic activity of the plasmacytic ele&#173;ments. Some lesions are composed of lymphocytes and lymphoplasmacytoid cells, with the combined properties of both lymphocytes and plasma cells. Plasma cell tumors display the same spectrum of clinical involvement as do lymphoproliferative lesions but are much less common.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Histiocytic Disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Langerhans cell histiocytosis</span> (formerly called <span class="italic">histiocytosis X</span>) is a collection of rare disorders of the mononuclear phagocytic system (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-19</span>). &#173;These disorders are thought to result from abnormal immune regulation. All subtypes are characterized by an accumulation of proliferating dendritic histiocytes. The disease occurs most commonly in &#173;children, with a peak incidence between 5 and 10&#160;years of age, and it varies in severity, from benign lesions with spontaneous resolution to chronic dissemination that results in death. Older names representing the vari&#173;ous manifestations of histiocytic disorders <span class="italic">(eosinophilic granuloma </span><span class="italic">of bone, Hand-&#173;Sch</span><span class="accent_italic">ü</span><span class="italic">ller-&#173;Christian disease,</span> and <span class="italic">Letterer-&#173;Siwe disease)</span> are being replaced by the terms <span class="italic">unifocal</span> and <span class="italic">multifocal eosinophilic granuloma of bone</span> and <span class="italic">diffuse soft tissue </span><span class="italic">histiocytosis.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">If sufficiently large, the mass may cause proptosis (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-19A, B</span>). Younger &#173;children more often pre&#173;sent with significant overlying soft-&#173;tissue inflammation; they are also more likely to have multifocal or systemic involvement. Even if the initial workup shows no evidence of systemic dissemination, younger patients require regular observation for pos&#173;si&#173;ble development of multiorgan disease. The most frequent pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion in the orbit is a lytic defect best noted on CT imaging (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-19C</span>), usually affecting the superotemporal orbit or sphenoid wing and causing relapsing episodes of orbital inflammation, often initially misdiagnosed as infectious orbital cellulitis. MRI imaging aids in visualization of the soft-&#173;tissue component (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-19D</span>). Histopathology shows foamy histiocytes with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and irregular nuclei that are immunoreactive for antibodies against CD1a (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-19E, F</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Histiocytic disorders have a reported survival rate of only 50% in patients who are younger than 2&#160;years at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion; if the disease develops &#173;after age 2, the survival rate rises to 87%. Treatment of localized orbital disease consists of confirmatory biopsy with debulking, which may be followed by intralesional ste&#173;roid injection or low-&#173;dose radiation therapy. Spontaneous remission has also been reported. Although destruction of the orbital bone may be extensive at the time of pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, the bone usually reossifies completely. &#173;Children with systemic disease are treated aggressively with chemotherapy.</p>

			<p class="h2">Xanthogranuloma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Adult xanthogranuloma of the adnexa and orbit is often associated with systemic manifestations. &#173;These manifestations are the basis for classification into the following 4 syndromes, presented in their order of frequency.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NBX).</span> This disorder is characterized by the presence of subcutaneous lesions in the eyelids and anterior orbit; lesions may also occur throughout the body. Although skin lesions are seen in all 4 syndromes, &#173;those occurring in NBX have a propensity for ulceration and fibrosis. Systemic findings frequently include paraproteinemia and multiple myeloma.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Adult-&#173;onset asthma with periocular xanthogranuloma (AAPOX).</span> This syndrome includes periocular xanthogranuloma, asthma, lymphadenopathy, and, often, increased levels of immunoglobulin G.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Erdheim-&#173;Chester disease (ECD).</span> The most devastating of the adult xanthogranulomas, ECD (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-20</span>) is characterized by dense, progressive, recalcitrant fibrosclerosis of the orbit and internal organs, including the mediastinum; the pericardium; and the pleural, perinephric, and retroperitoneal spaces. Whereas xanthogranuloma of the orbit and adnexa tends to be anterior in NBX, AAPOX, and AOX, it is often diffuse in ECD and leads to vision loss. Bone involvement is common, and the syndrome often is fatal, despite aggressive therapies.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Adult-&#173;onset xanthogranuloma (AOX)</span>.

			<p class="h1">Lacrimal Gland Tumors</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most lacrimal gland masses represent nonspecific inflammation <span class="italic">(dacryoadenitis)</span>. They pre&#173;sent with acute inflammatory signs and usually respond to anti-&#173;inflammatory medi&#173;cation (see the section&#160;Nonspecific Orbital Inflammation in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span>). Of &#173;those lacrimal gland tumefactions not presenting with inflammatory signs and symptoms, the majority are lymphoproliferative disorders (discussed previously). Up to 50% of orbital lymphomas develop in the fossa of the lacrimal gland. Only a minority of lacrimal fossa lesions are epithelial neoplasms of the lacrimal gland.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Imaging is helpful in evaluating lesions in the lacrimal gland region. Inflammatory and lymphoid proliferations in the lacrimal gland tend to cause it to expand diffusely and appear elongated, whereas epithelial neoplasms tend to appear as isolated globular masses. Inflammatory and lymphoproliferative lesions usually mold around the globe, but epithelial neoplasms tend to displace and indent it. The bone of the lacrimal fossa is remodeled in response to a slowly growing benign epithelial lesion of the lacrimal gland; however, lymphoproliferative lesions typically do not cause bony changes.</p>
			<p class="h2">Epithelial Tumors of the Lacrimal Gland</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 50% of epithelial tumors are benign mixed tumors <span class="italic">(pleomorphic adenomas),</span> and about 50% are carcinomas. Approximately half of the carcinomas are adenoid cystic carcinomas, and the remainder are malignant mixed tumors, primary adenocarcinomas, mucoepidermoid carcinomas, or squamous carcinomas.</p>
			<p class="h3">Pleomorphic adenoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common epithelial tumor of the lacrimal gland. This tumor usually occurs in adults during the fourth or fifth de&#173;cade of life and affects slightly more men than &#173;women. Patients pre&#173;sent with a progressive, painless inferior and medial displacement of the globe with axial proptosis (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-21A</span>). Symptoms usually persist for more than 12 months.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A firm, lobular mass may be palpated near the superolateral orbital rim, and orbital imaging often reveals enlargement or expansion of the fossa of the lacrimal gland. On imaging, the lesion appears well circumscribed but may have a slightly nodular configuration (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-21B, C</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Microscopically, pleomorphic adenomas have a varied cellular structure consisting primarily of a proliferation of benign epithelial cells and a stroma composed of spindle-&#173;shaped cells with occasional cartilaginous, mucinous, or even osteoid degeneration or metaplasia. &#173;Because of this variability, the term <span class="italic">benign mixed tumor</span> is sometimes used<span class="italic">.</span> The lesion is circumscribed by a pseudocapsule.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Management</span> Treatment is complete removal of the pleomorphic adenoma with its pseudocapsule and a surrounding margin of orbital tissue (<span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;5-21D</span>). Surgery should be performed without a preliminary biopsy: in an early study, the recurrence rate was 32% when the capsule was incised for direct biopsy. In recurrences, the risk of malignant degeneration into carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is 10% per de&#173;cade.</p>

			<p class="h3">Adenoid cystic carcinoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is the most common malignant tumor of the lacrimal gland. This highly malignant carcinoma may cause pain &#173;because of perineural invasion and bone destruction. The relatively rapid course, with a history of generally less than 1 year, and early onset of pain help differentiate ACC from pleomorphic adenoma, which is painless and characteristically exhibits progressive proptosis for more than a year. The tumor usually extends into the posterior orbit &#173;because of its capacity to infiltrate and its lack of true encapsulation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Microscopically, this tumor is composed of deceptively benign-&#173;appearing cells that grow in tubules, solid nests, or a Swiss-&#173;cheese pattern. The basaloid morphology is associated with worse survival than the cribriform variant. Infiltration of the orbital tissues, including perineural invasion, is often seen in microscopic sections.</p>
			<p class="h3">Malignant mixed tumor</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;These lesions are histologically similar to pleomorphic adenomas (benign mixed tumors), but they have areas of malignant change, usually poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. They typically arise from a long-&#173;standing primary pleomorphic adenoma or from a pleomorphic adenoma that has recurred &#173;after initial incomplete excision or violation of the pseudocapsule (see the section “Pleomorphic adenoma”). An increase in growth rate is a hallmark of malignant degeneration.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management of malignant lacrimal gland tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Suspicion of a malignant lacrimal gland tumor warrants biopsy with permanent histologic confirmation. Traditional treatment is centered around orbital exenteration or radical orbitectomy followed by radiotherapy; however, the survival benefit of exenteration remains unproven. Other treatment strategies include neoadjuvant intra-&#173;arterial chemotherapy followed by exenteration or eye-&#173;sparing surgery followed by radiation (typically proton) therapy. Despite &#173;these mea&#173;sures, ascending perineural extension often develops, usually leading to death from intracranial extension or, less commonly, from systemic metastases (managed by local resection) a de&#173;cade or more &#173;after the initial pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion.</p>

			<p class="h2">Nonepithelial Tumors of the Lacrimal Gland</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vast majority of nonepithelial lesions of the lacrimal gland represent lymphoid proliferation or inflammations, discussed &#173;earlier in this chapter&#160;and in Chapter&#160;4 of this volume<span class="italic">.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Benign lymphocytic infiltrates may be seen in patients, particularly &#173;women, who have bilateral swelling of the lacrimal gland, producing a dry eye syndrome. This condition can occur insidiously or following a symptomatic episode of lacrimal gland inflammation. The enlargement of the lacrimal glands may not be clinically apparent. Biopsy specimens of the affected glands show a spectrum of lymphocytic infiltration, from scattered patches of lymphocytes to lymphocytic replacement of the lacrimal gland parenchyma with preservation of the inner duct cells, which are surrounded by proliferating myoepithelial cells <span class="italic">(epimyoepithelial islands).</span> This combination of lymphocytes and epimyoepithelial islands has led some authors to designate this manifestation as a lymphoepithelial lesion. Some patients with lymphocytic infiltrates may also have systemic rheumatoid arthritis and, therefore, have classic Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren syndrome. &#173;These lesions may develop into low-&#173;grade B-&#173;cell lymphoma (see the section&#160;Lymphoproliferative Disorders). Associated dry eye symptoms may improve with the use of topical cyclosporine.</p>

			<p class="h1">Secondary Orbital Conditions</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Secondary orbital tumors are &#173;those that extend into the orbit from contiguous structures, including the globe, the eyelids, the lacrimal drainage system, the sinuses, or the brain.</p>
			<p class="h2">Globe and Eyelid Origin</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tumors and inflammations from within the eye (especially from choroidal melanomas and retinoblastomas) or from the eyelid (eg, sebaceous gland carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma) can invade the orbit. Primary eyelid tumors are discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>. Retinoblastoma, choroidal melanoma, and other ocular neoplasms are covered in BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> and Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span></p>

			<p class="h2">Sinus Disease Affecting the Orbit</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tumors from the nose or the paranasal sinuses may secondarily invade the orbit. Proptosis and globe displacement are common. The diagnosis is made by imaging, which is ordered to include the base of the sinuses for proper evaluation.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Mucoceles</span> and <span class="italic">mucopyoceles</span> of the sinuses (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-22</span>) are cystic structures with pseudostratified ciliated columnar (respiratory) epithelium resulting from obstruction of the sinus excretory ducts. &#173;These lesions may invade the orbit by expansion and erosion of the bones of the orbital walls and cause globe displacement. In the case of mucoceles, the cysts are usually filled with thick mucoid secretions; in the case of mucopyoceles, they are filled with pus. Most mucoceles arise from the frontal and/or ethmoid sinuses. Surgical treatment includes evacuation of the mucocele and reestablishment of drainage of the affected sinus or obliteration of the sinus by mucosal stripping and packing with bone or fat.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">&#173;Silent sinus syndrome</span> is another orbital condition that results from sinus outflow pathology (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-23</span>). Chronic subclinical sinusitis presumably &#173;causes thinning of the bones of the maxillary sinus, leading to collapse of the orbital floor and subsequent enophthalmos. This collapse may occur in association with a recent significant change in atmospheric pressure (eg, during airplane travel or scuba diving). Upper eyelid ptosis, deepening of the superior sulcus, and, occasionally, diplopia may occur. Treatment includes restoration of maxillary sinus aeration and reconstruction of the orbital floor. The entrapped maxillary sinus secretions are often sterile in nature.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Squamous cell carcinoma</span> and <span class="italic">adenocarcinoma</span> of the sinuses may secondarily invade the orbit (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-24</span>). &#173;These malignancies usually arise in the maxillary sinuses, followed by the nasopharynx or the oropharynx. Nasal obstruction, epistaxis, or epiphora may be associated with the growth of such tumors. Treatment is usually a combination of surgical excision and radiation therapy and often includes exenteration if the periorbita is traversed by tumor.</p>

			<p class="h1">Metastatic Tumors</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top8">
			<p class="h2-h1">Metastatic Tumors in &#173;Children</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In &#173;children, distant tumors metastasize to the orbit more frequently than to the globe (in contrast to adults, who more frequently have metastases to the choroid). Tumors that can metastasize to the orbit in &#173;children include Burkitt lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma).</p>
			<p class="h3">Leukemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In advanced stages, leukemia may produce unilateral or bilateral proptosis. <span class="italic">Acute lymphoblastic leukemia</span> is the type of leukemia most likely to metastasize to the orbit. A primary leukemic orbital mass, called <span class="italic">granulocytic sarcoma</span> or <span class="italic">chloroma,</span> is a rare variant of myelogenous leukemia. Least common are metastases to the subarachnoid space of the optic nerve. &#173;These cases pre&#173;sent with sudden vision loss and swelling of the optic nerve. They constitute an emergency and are treated with orbital radiotherapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Typically, orbital lesions pre&#173;sent before blood or bone marrow signs of leukemia, which almost invariably follow within several months. Special stains for cytoplasmic esterase in the cells (Leder stain) indicate that they are granulocytic precursor cells. Chances for survival are improved if chemotherapy is instituted before the discovery of leukemic involvement in bone marrow or peripheral blood.</p>
			<p class="h3">Neuroblastoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Metastatic orbital neuroblastoma occurs in 10%–20% of cases and typically produces an abrupt ecchymotic proptosis that may be bilateral. A deposition of blood in the eyelids may lead to the mistaken impression of injury (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-25</span>). Horner syndrome may also be evident in some cases. Commonly, bone destruction is apparent on CT, particularly in the lateral orbital wall or sphenoid marrow. Metastases typically occur late in the course of the disease, when the primary tumor can be detected readily in the abdomen, mediastinum, or neck. Treatment consists primarily of chemotherapy; radiotherapy is reserved for cases of impending vision loss due to compressive optic neuropathy. The survival rate of <br />neuroblastoma is related to the patient’s age at diagnosis. Patients diagnosed before <br />1&#160;year of age have a significantly better prognosis (a 5-&#173;year survival of 85%) than &#173;children diagnosed &#173;after 1 year of age (5-&#173;year survival rate of 36%). Unfortunately, the average age of pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of patients with orbital metastases is over 2&#160;years of age. Congenital neuroblastoma of the cervical ganglia may produce an ipsilateral Horner syndrome with heterochromia.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Metastatic Tumors in Adults</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although virtually any cancer of the internal organs, hematopoietic system, or skin can metastasize to the orbit, most orbital metastases derive from lung, breast, and prostate tumors. The presence of pain, proptosis, inflammation, bone destruction, and early ophthalmoplegia suggests the possibility of metastatic carcinoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some 75% of patients have a history of a known primary tumor, but orbital metastasis is the presenting sign of cancer in 25% of patients. The extraocular muscles are frequently involved &#173;because of their abundant blood supply. The second most common site is the bone marrow space of the sphenoid bone &#173;because of the relatively high volume of low-&#173;flow blood in this area (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-26</span>). Lytic destruction of this part&#160;of the lateral orbital wall is highly suggestive of metastatic disease. Elevation of serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels also may suggest a metastatic pro&#173;cess. Fine-&#173;needle aspiration biopsy can be performed in the office and may obviate the need for orbitotomy and open biopsy.</p>
			<p class="h3">Breast carcinoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common primary source of orbital metastases in &#173;women is breast cancer. Metastases may occur many years &#173;after the breast lesion has been removed; thus, the history should always include inquiries about previous cancer surgery. Breast metastasis to the orbit can elicit a fibrous response that &#173;causes enophthalmos and, possibly, restriction of ocular motility (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-27</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some patients with breast cancer respond favorably to hormone therapy. This response usually correlates with the presence of estrogen and other hormone receptors in the tumor tissue. Estrogen receptor assay results from orbital metastases may differ from &#173;those of the primary lesion; thus, orbital tissue studies should include this assay. Hormone therapy is most likely to help patients whose tumors are receptor positive.</p>
			<p class="h3">Bronchogenic carcinoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most frequent origin of orbital metastasis in men is bronchogenic carcinoma. The primary lesion may be quite small, and CT of suspicious lung lesions may be performed in patients suspected of having orbital metastases.</p>
			<p class="h3">Prostate carcinoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Metastatic prostate carcinoma can produce a clinical picture resembling that of acute nonspecific orbital inflammation. Typically, a lytic bone lesion is identified on imaging.</p>
			<p class="h2">Management of Orbital Metastases</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The treatment of metastatic tumors of the orbit is usually palliative, consisting of local radiation therapy. Some metastatic tumors, such as carcinoids and renal cell carcinomas, may be candidates for wide excision of the orbital lesion &#173;because patients may survive for many years following resection of isolated metastases. Consultation with the patient’s oncologist is impor&#173;tant for identifying candidates who might benefit from wide excision.</p>
