			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Orbital trauma is amongst the most common emergency department consultations and is often accompanied by trauma of the facial bones and soft tissue.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Additional injuries that may be observed in the setting of orbital trauma include orbital hemorrhage, retained foreign body, and optic neuropathy.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Ophthalmic manifestations of orbital trauma may include decreased vision, intraocular injury, strabismus, and eyelid or globe malposition.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-1">An ophthalmic examination should be performed on all patients who have sustained orbital trauma as ocular injuries may also be pre&#173;sent.</li>

			<p class="h1">Midfacial (Le Fort) Fractures</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Le Fort fractures involve the maxilla and are often complex and asymmetric (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;6-1</span>, <span class="xref-figure">6-2</span>). By definition, Le Fort fractures extend posteriorly through the pterygoid plates. &#173;These fractures may be divided into 3&#160;categories, although clinically they often do not conform precisely to &#173;these groupings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Le Fort I</span> fractures are low transverse maxillary fractures above the teeth with no orbital involvement.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Le Fort II</span> fractures generally have a pyramidal configuration and involve the nasal, lacrimal, and maxillary bones as well as the medial orbital floor.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Le Fort III</span> fractures cause craniofacial disjunction, in which the entire facial skeleton is completely detached from the base of the skull and is suspended only by soft tissues. The orbital floor as well as the medial and lateral orbital walls are involved.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment may include dental stabilization with arch bars and open reduction of the fracture with rigid fixation using titanium plating systems.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Orbital Fractures</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Zygomatic Fractures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-3</span>) are also referred to as <span class="italic">quadri</span><span class="italic">pod </span><span class="italic">fractures</span> &#173;because the zygoma is usually fractured at 4 of its articulations with the adjacent bones: (1) frontozygomatic suture, (2) inferior orbital rim, (3) zygomatic arch, and (4) lateral wall of the maxillary sinus. ZMC fractures involve the orbital floor to varying degrees. If the zygoma is not significantly displaced, treatment may not be necessary. ZMC fractures can cause globe displacement, lateral canthal dystopia, cosmetic deformity, diplopia, and trismus (limitation of mandibular opening) due to fracture impingement on the coronoid pro&#173;cess of the mandible.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When treatment is indicated, the best results are obtained with open reduction of the fracture and rigid plate fixation (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;6-3D</span>). Exact realignment and stabilization of the lateral maxillary buttress and the lateral orbital wall are essential for accurate fracture reduction and can be achieved through a combination of eyelid and buccal sulcus incisions. If the lateral maxillary buttress is only mildly displaced, complete reduction and fixation can be accomplished through an eyelid incision.</p>
			<p class="h2">Orbital Apex Fractures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital apex fractures usually occur in association with other fractures of the face, orbit, or skull and may involve the optic canal, superior orbital fissure, and structures that pass through them. Pos&#173;si&#173;ble associated complications include traumatic optic neuropathy; cerebrospinal fluid leak; and carotid-&#173;cavernous fistula. Orbital computed tomography (CT) may demonstrate evidence of direct optic nerve injury with a fracture at or adjacent to the optic canal.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Orbital Roof Fractures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital roof fractures are usually caused by blunt trauma or missile injuries. They are more common in young &#173;children, in whom the frontal sinus has yet to pneumatize. Because the ratio of the cranial vault to the midface is greater in &#173;children than in adults, frontal impact is more likely to occur with a fall. By contrast, frontal trauma in older individuals is partially absorbed by the frontal sinus, which diffuses the force and prevents extension of the fracture along the orbital roof. Complications of orbital roof fractures include intracranial injuries, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, pneumocephalus, pulsatile proptosis, subperiosteal hematoma, ptosis, and extraocular muscle imbalance. In roof fractures, the entrapment of extraocular muscles is rare, with most early diplopia resulting from hematoma, edema, or contusion of the orbital structures. In severely comminuted fractures, pulsating exophthalmos may occur as a delayed complication. Young &#173;children may develop nondisplaced linear roof fractures &#173;after fairly minor trauma, which may pre&#173;sent with delayed ecchymosis of the upper eyelid. Most roof fractures do not require repair. Indications for surgery are generally neurosurgical, and treatment often involves a multidisciplinary team.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Medial Orbital Fractures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Naso-&#173;orbital-&#173;ethmoidal (NOE) fractures (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-4</span>) usually result from the face striking a solid surface. &#173;These fractures commonly involve the frontal pro&#173;cess of the maxilla, the lacrimal bone, and the ethmoid bones along the medial wall of the orbit. Patients characteristically have a depressed bridge of the nose and traumatic telecanthus. &#173;These fractures may be divided into 3 categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-8">Type&#160;I involve a central fragment of bone attached to canthal tendon.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Type&#160;II are comminuted fractures of the central fragment.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-9">Type&#160;III involve a comminuted tendon attachment or an avulsed tendon.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Complications associated with NOE fractures include ce&#173;re&#173;bral and ocular damage, severe epistaxis due to avulsion of the anterior ethmoidal artery, orbital hematoma, cere&#173;brospinal fluid rhinorrhea, damage to the lacrimal drainage system, lateral displacement of the medial canthus, and associated fractures of the medial orbital wall and floor. Treatment is dependent on the type of fracture; it generally includes fracture reduction and microplate fixation. Transnasal wiring of the medial canthus is used less frequently, &#173;because microplates often allow precise bony reduction.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Indirect (blowout) fractures</span> of the medial wall are frequently extensions of blowout fractures of the orbital floor. Isolated blowout fractures of the medial orbital wall may also occur. Surgical intervention is indicated in cases involving muscle and associated tissue entrapment, per&#173;sis&#173;tent restrictive diplopia, and aesthetically unacceptable enophthalmos. Some surgeons choose to intervene on the basis of fracture size and believe the risk of enophthalmos is greatest when both the floor and the medial wall are fractured. However, determining the size of the fracture from imaging studies can be difficult. If surgery is required, the medial orbital wall can be approached by continuing the exploration of the floor superiorly along the medial wall via a lower eyelid or transconjunctival approach. An alternative approach is a medial orbitotomy through a retrocaruncular approach or, less commonly, a frontoethmoidal skin incision. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7</span> in this volume for discussion of orbital surgery approaches.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Orbital Floor Fractures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Direct fractures of the orbital floor can extend from fractures of the inferior orbital rim, whereas indirect fractures of the orbital floor are not associated with fractures of the rim. Indications for repair of both fracture types are similar.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is thought that orbital floor fractures are caused by 1 of 2 mechanisms or a combination of the 2. According to the hydraulic mechanism theory, blunt trauma rapidly occludes the orbital aperture, resulting in increased intraorbital pressure. This pressure &#173;causes the orbital bones to break or “blow out” at their weakest point along the posterior medial part of the floor, which comprises the maxillary bone. By contrast, according to the buckling mechanism theory, a striking object &#173;causes deformation of the inferior rim, resulting in forces that are transmitted and focused on the orbital floor, resulting in a blowout. Regardless of the mechanism, orbital contents may prolapse through the fracture into the maxillary sinus and sometimes become entrapped.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of a blowout fracture of the orbital floor is suggested by the patient’s history, physical examination, and orbital imaging studies. There is often a history of the orbital aperture being struck by an object that is larger than its dia&#173;meter (eg, a ball, an automobile dashboard, or a fist). An orbital blowout fracture should be suspected in any patient who has received a periorbital blow forceful enough to cause ecchymosis. Physical examination typically reveals the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-12"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Eyelid signs.</span> Ecchymosis and edema of the eyelids may be pre&#173;sent, but external signs of injury can be absent <span class="bullet-list_italic">(white-&#173;eyed blowout fracture).</span></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Diplopia with limitation of upgaze, downgaze, or both.</span> &#173;Limited vertical movement of the globe on attempted supraduction with vertical diplopia and pain in the inferior orbit can be consistent with entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle or its &#173;adjacent septa in the fracture, especially in cases of pediatric orbital trauma. However, orbital edema and/or hemorrhage is a more likely cause of diplopia in the acute posttraumatic period and can take weeks to months to completely resolve. Less commonly, damage to the extraocular muscles or their innervation can result in significant limitation of both horizontal and vertical eye movements. If entrapment is pre&#173;sent, a <span class="bullet-list_italic">forced duc</span><span class="bullet-list_italic">tion test (traction test)</span> &#173;will show restriction of passive movement of the eye. This test can be performed with the instillation of anesthetic eyedrops followed by a cotton pledget of topical anesthetic in the inferior cul-&#173;de-&#173;sac for several minutes. Using toothed forceps, the examiner engages the insertion of the inferior rectus muscle through the conjunctiva and attempts to rotate the globe &#173;gently up and down. This test may be uncomfortable for a conscious patient and may be deferred to the time of surgery, when the patient is &#173;under anesthesia. It can help determine appropriate release of incarcerated tissue during surgery. Another characteristic finding of inferior rectus entrapment is an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) in upgaze in comparison to primary gaze.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Enophthalmos and ptosis of the globe.</span> &#173;These findings can occur with large fractures in which the orbital soft tissues prolapse into the maxillary sinus. If associated with the orbital floor fracture, a medial wall fracture may significantly contribute to enophthalmos &#173;because of the prolapse of orbital tissues into both the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses. Enophthalmos may be masked by orbital edema immediately following injury and may become more apparent as edema subsides.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Hypoesthesia in the distribution of the infraorbital nerve.</span></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-13"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Emphysema of the orbit and eyelids.</span> Any fracture that extends into a sinus may allow air to escape into the subcutaneous tissues and is commonly associated with fractures of the medial orbital wall. Patients with fractures are advised to avoid nose blowing to prevent orbital emphysema.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with orbital floor fractures, vision loss can result from globe trauma, injury to the optic nerve, or increased orbital pressure causing a <span class="italic">compartment syndrome</span> (discussed &#173;later in this chapter, in the section Orbital Compartment Syndrome). An orbital hemorrhage should be suspected if loss of vision is associated with proptosis and increased IOP. Injuries to the globe and ocular adnexa may also be pre&#173;sent.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital CT with coronal, axial, and sagittal views enables evaluation of the fracture size and extraocular muscle relationships, providing information that may help predict enophthalmos and muscle entrapment. However, despite the publication of multiple studies suggesting neuroimaging criteria for extraocular muscle entrapment, restrictive strabismus related to blowout fracture remains a clinical diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most orbital floor fractures do not require surgical intervention. Patients may be observed from weeks to months to allow edema and orbital hemorrhage to subside. Oral ste&#173;roids (1&#160;mg/kg per day for the first 7&#160;days) decrease edema and may help hasten the decision of &#173;whether surgery for diplopia is necessary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An exception to observation is in pediatric patients (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-5</span>) in which the inferior rectus muscle is more likely to become tightly ensnared within a trapdoor fracture. In &#173;these patients, vertical globe excursion is significantly &#173;limited, and CT reveals the inferior rectus muscle within the fracture site along the maxillary sinus. Eye movement may stimulate the oculocardiac reflex (Video 6-1), causing pain, nausea, and bradycardia. Urgent repair should be undertaken in &#173;these cases. Immediate release of the entrapped muscle may improve the final ocular motility by limiting fibrosis.</p>

			<p class="body-text">Other&#173;wise, the indications and timing for surgery remain controversial. Presently, &#173;there are no prospective, randomized clinical &#173;trials to guide decision making, and recommendations are based on noncomparative, retrospective reports or case series. The following 3&#160;criteria are suggested to define when surgery may be indicated:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-12"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Diplopia with limitation of upgaze and/or downgaze within 30° of the primary position; positive forced duction test; and radiologic confirmation of an orbital floor frac</span><span class="bullet-list_italic">ture.</span> &#173;These findings may indicate functional entrapment of tissues affecting the inferior rectus muscle. Diplopia &#173;will improve significantly over the course of the first several weeks to months as orbital edema and/or hemorrhage resolve and the entrapped tissues stretch. If the findings are still pre&#173;sent &#173;after 2&#160;weeks, some surgeons prefer to repair the fracture whereas &#173;others prefer to continue observing &#173;until findings are no longer improving. As mentioned &#173;earlier, tight entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle with pos&#173;si&#173;ble muscle ischemia is an indication for immediate repair.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Enophthalmos that exceeds 2&#160;mm and is cosmetically unacceptable to the patient.</span> Enophthalmos can be masked by orbital edema immediately &#173;after the injury and may delay recognition of the enophthalmos for weeks to months. Exophthalmometry mea&#173;sure&#173;ments are taken at the initial evaluation and at subsequent visits to monitor for enophthalmos. Some surgeons believe that when significant enophthalmos is pre&#173;sent within the first 2&#160;weeks of a large orbital floor fracture, greater enophthalmos may ensue, and thus intervention is indicated. &#173;Others believe that late enophthalmos is rare, even in the case of large fractures, and thus longer observation is appropriate, with the patient ultimately deciding &#173;whether the degree of enophthalmos is aesthetically unacceptable.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-1"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Large fractures involving at least half of the orbital floor, particularly when associated with large medial wall fractures as determined by CT.</span> Orbital fractures of this size may have a higher incidence of subsequent significant enophthalmos, and early repair may be sought. However, studies have shown that it can be difficult to predict who &#173;will proceed to develop significant enophthalmos based on imaging alone.<p class="reference--journal--first ParaOverride-18">Burnstine MA. Clinical recommendations for repair of isolated orbital floor fractures: an evidence-&#173;based analy&#173;sis. <span class="reference--journal-_italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2002;109(7):1207–1210.</p><p class="reference--journal--last ParaOverride-19">Kersten RC, Vagefi MR, Bartley GB. Orbital “blowout” fractures: time for a new paradigm. <span class="reference--journal-_italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2018;125(6):796–798.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Surgical management of orbital fractures</span> Some surgeons prefer to proceed with the repair within 2&#160;weeks of the initial trauma, believing that scar tissue formation and contracture of the prolapsed tissue make &#173;later correction of diplopia and/or enophthalmos difficult. Other surgeons prefer to observe the fracture to allow complete resolution of the orbital edema and/or hemorrhage with a determination of &#173;whether residual diplopia and/or aesthetically significant enophthalmos merits repair. Satisfactory correction of diplopia and enophthalmos is obtainable even if surgery is delayed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The surgical approach to blowout fractures of the orbital floor is ideally performed through an inferior transconjunctival incision &#173;either with or without a lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis. The approaches through the lower eyelid have the following steps in common: elevation of the periorbita from the orbital floor, release of the prolapsed tissues from the fracture, and, usually, placement of an implant over the fracture to prevent recurrent adhesions and prolapse of the orbital tissues.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Orbital implants can be alloplastic (porous polyethylene, nylon foil, polytetrafluoroethylene, silicone sheet, or titanium mesh) or autogenous (split cranial bone, iliac crest bone, or fascia). Alloplastic implants combined with both synthetic and metallic components enable microplating and are an option for the management of large orbital floor and/or combined medial wall fractures. The harvesting of autologous grafts requires an additional operative site, and bone grafts are rarely indicated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Delayed treatment of blowout fractures to correct per&#173;sis&#173;tent restrictive diplopia or cosmetically unacceptable enophthalmos may include exploration of the orbital floor to &#173;free prolapsed tissue and reposition it in the orbit. In late surgery for enophthalmos, placement of an implant to reposition the globe anteriorly and/or superiorly may be necessary. Other treatment options include strabismus surgery and procedures to camouflage the narrowed palpebral fissure and deep superior sulcus associated with enophthalmos.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Complications of blowout fracture surgery include decreased vision or blindness, per&#173;sis&#173;tent or new diplopia, undercorrection or overcorrection of enophthalmos, retraction of the lower eyelid, hypoesthesia of the infraorbital nerve, infection, early or late extrusion of the implant, lymphedema, delayed orbital hemorrhage around the implant, and damage to the lacrimal drainage system.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Intraorbital Foreign Bodies</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital CT is the study of choice to localize an orbital foreign body (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-6</span>). An inorganic foreign body may be difficult to visualize on CT and is better observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, MRI should be avoided if &#173;there is a possibility that the foreign object is ferromagnetic. Orbital ultrasonography may be helpful for foreign bodies positioned more anteriorly. Treatment of orbital foreign bodies initially involves culturing the wound (or the foreign body if it is removed) and administering antibiotics. Foreign bodies should be removed if they are composed of vegetable &#173;matter or if they are easily accessible in the anterior orbit. If an embedded foreign body &#173;causes an orbital infection that drains to the skin surface, it is sometimes pos&#173;si&#173;ble to locate the object by surgically following the fistulous tract posteriorly. In many cases, objects can be safely observed without surgery if they are inert and have smooth edges or are located in the posterior orbit. Pellets from BB guns are common intraorbital foreign bodies and are usually best left in place. MRI can be safely performed with a BB pellet pre&#173;sent in the orbit.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Orbital Compartment Syndrome</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orbital compartment syndrome (OCS) occurs as a result of an acute rise in orbital pressure from hemorrhage (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-7</span>) or introduction of air into the orbit. It most commonly occurs in association with trauma, surgery, retrobulbar or peribulbar injections, or preexisting orbital disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because the orbit has a fixed volume, &#173;there is &#173;limited room to accommodate any expansion of its contents. As orbital pressure increases, associated vision loss can be attributed to 1 of the 4 following mechanisms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">direct compressive optic neuropathy</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">compression of optic nerve vasculature</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">ischemic optic neuropathy that results from stretching of nutrient vessels</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Examination of a patient with OCS reveals decreased vision, afferent pupillary defect, and increased IOP. Elevated IOP in cases of OCS reflects the increased orbital pressure and is not indicative of glaucoma. In addition, a tight orbit with decreased extraocular movements and proptosis is often observed. Patients should undergo emergent decompression of the orbit, as described in Figure 6-8. &#173;Because vision loss can pro&#173;gress rapidly, this procedure should not be delayed for orbital imaging. If OCS is pre&#173;sent in a patient with antecedent eyelid or orbital surgery, the wound should be opened and the hematoma evacuated, followed by exploration and cautery of active bleeding. Other&#173;wise, decompression is most easily achieved by lateral canthotomy and cantholysis, in which the eyelids are disinserted from the lateral orbital rim, allowing the orbital volume to expand anteriorly. Lateral canthotomy alone does not sufficiently decrease orbital pressure; inferior cantholysis and sometimes superior cantholysis are also required. Careful monitoring and reassessment of the ophthalmic examination are necessary to determine &#173;whether further surgical intervention is needed.</p>

			<p class="h1">Traumatic Vision Loss With Clear Media</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many patients report decreased vision following periocular trauma. It is imperative that a complete ophthalmic examination be performed to rule out direct globe injury or OCS. Reduction in visual acuity may be due to associated injuries of the cornea, lens, vitreous, ret&#173;ina, or orbit. In addition, eyelid edema may impede opening of the eyes to sufficiently clear the visual axis. However, a small percentage of patients have true vision loss without any evidence of globe injury. Vision loss in &#173;these cases suggests traumatic dysfunction of the optic nerve, also known as <span class="italic">traumatic optic neuropathy.</span> Such vision loss results from 1 of the 2&#160;following mechanisms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">direct injury to the optic nerve from a penetrating wound, bone fragment, or nerve avulsion</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">indirect injury caused by force from a frontal blow transmitted to the intracanalicular portion of the optic nerve</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The presence of an afferent pupillary defect in patients with an intact globe strongly suggests traumatic optic neuropathy. However, detection of an afferent defect may be difficult if the patient has received narcotics that cause pupillary constriction or if the traumatic optic nerve injury is bilateral and symmetric.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The details of the injury and orbital imaging can help differentiate direct optic nerve injury from indirect. A penetrating wound likely indicates direct injury. History of blunt trauma to the frontal region or rapid deceleration of the cranium, often in patients who have experienced loss of consciousness, is suggestive of indirect injury. CT imaging of the orbits can demonstrate disruption of the optic nerve or fracture involving the orbital apex and/or optic canal in cases of direct injury but is often unremarkable in patients with indirect injury (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-9</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The proper management of neurogenic vision loss &#173;after blunt head trauma is controversial. Observation alone, high-&#173;dose corticosteroids, and surgical decompression of the optic canal have been considered as treatment options for indirect traumatic optic neuropathy. However, recent studies have shown that high-&#173;dose corticosteroid therapy may not provide any additional vision benefit over observation alone, and such treatment is contraindicated in patients with concomitant traumatic brain injury. In addition, other studies have shown that decompression of the optic nerve provides no additional benefit over observation alone while subjecting patients to the risks associated with surgery. The optimal management of indirect traumatic optic neuropathy remains unresolved. &#173;Future research focused on neuroprotection and regeneration is needed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ultimately, vision loss &#173;after trauma can have serious consequences relating to employment, education, driving, and/or other daily activities. Referral for a comprehensive vision rehabilitation assessment and intervention should be an integral part of the treatment plan for the patient. Significant psychosocial issues may also need to be addressed.</p>

			<div id="Chapt6_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A mass casualty incident (MCI) is defined as an event in which the need for emergency care exceeds the available medical resources, including personnel and equipment. With the rise of global and domestic terrorism, MCIs have unfortunately become more commonplace. &#173;Unless physicians have had prior experience treating battlefield injuries, they have under&#173;gone &#173;little training in the management of wounds arising from an MCI. An understanding of the mechanisms of injury, appropriate triage, and primary goals of initial surgery is needed to properly treat an MCI. &#173;These incidents often involve high-&#173;velocity weapons (eg, improvised explosive devices and assault &#173;rifles) that cause a pattern of injury dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from the wounds resulting from low-&#173;velocity weapons that a trauma center would typically see. In addition, hospitals are seldom prepared for the large number of injured patients seeking treatment &#173;after an MCI occurs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lessons learned from physicians who have worked in combat zones have greatly improved the understanding of &#173;these types of injuries and enabled the application of &#173;these management princi&#173;ples in the civilian sector. On the battlefield, medics triage injured soldiers into 4 categories of urgency. The injured are stabilized accordingly and prepared for urgent medical evacuation to a combat-&#173;support hospital, where a team of specialists evaluate and surgically stabilize them. Once patients are hemodynamically stable, ophthalmic evaluation and primary surgical repair can be performed within hours of the injury. In the combat operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, ocular injuries &#173;were the fourth most common injury observed. Of the soldiers sustaining ocular trauma, 85% had other systemic injuries.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the management of an MCI, similar princi&#173;ples of triage and identification of immediate life-&#173;threatening injuries, with a focus on airways, breathing, and circulation, are required. Following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, 62% of the casualties &#173;were transported to level I trauma centers, and 13.4% of &#173;those patients required ophthalmology consultation. &#173;These combat-&#173;medic princi&#173;ples allow physicians to provide the greatest benefit to the highest number of patients.</p>
