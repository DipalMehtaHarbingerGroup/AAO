			<p class="chapter-title">Photoablation: Complications and Adverse Effects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), 2 of the most common kinds of refractive surgeries, are relatively safe and effective procedures. As with all types of surgery, there are potential risks and complications, and thus it is important to understand how to avoid, diagnose, and treat the complications of refractive surgery. Comprehensive ophthalmologists, as well as refractive surgeons, should be knowledgeable about these postoperative problems, given the increasing number of patients who undergo refractive surgery each year.</p>
			<p class="h1">General Complications Related to Laser Ablation</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Overcorrection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Overcorrection may occur if significant stromal dehydration develops prior to initiation of the excimer treatment, as more stromal tissue will be ablated per pulse. This overcorrection may occur if there is a long delay prior to beginning the ablation, following either removal of the epithelium in surface ablation or lifting the flap in LASIK. Controlling the humidity and temperature in the laser suite within the recommended excimer laser guidelines may decrease variability and ideally improve refractive outcomes. Overcorrection tends to occur more often in older individuals, as their wound-&#173;healing response is less vigorous and their corneas ablate more rapidly for reasons not fully understood.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Myopic or hyperopic surface ablation typically undergoes some degree of refractive regression for at least 3–6&#160;months. In general, patients with higher degrees of myopia and any degree of hyperopia require more time to attain refractive stability, which must be achieved before any decision is made regarding possible re-&#173;treatment of the overcorrection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Various modalities are available for treating small amounts of overcorrection. Myopic regression can be induced after surface ablation by abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids. Patients with consecutive hyperopia (ie, hyperopia due to overcorrection of myopia) or consecutive myopia (ie, myopia due to overcorrection of hyperopia) require less treatment to achieve emmetropia compared with previously untreated eyes, as both are considered to have over-&#173;responded to the initial treatment. When re-&#173;treating such patients, the surgeon should take care not to overcorrect a second time. With conventional ablation, most surgeons will reduce the ablation by 20%–25% for consecutive treatments. For wavefront procedures, review of the depth of the ablation and the amount of higher-&#173;order aberration helps titrate the re-&#173;treatment.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Undercorrection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Undercorrection occurs much more commonly with treatment of higher degrees of ametropia. Patients with regression after treatment of their first eye have an increased likelihood of regression in their second eye. Topical mitomycin&#160;C, administered at the time of initial surface ablation, can be used to modulate the response, especially in patients with higher levels of ametropia. Sometimes the regression may be reversed with aggressive administration of topical corticosteroids. The patient may undergo a re-&#173;treatment generally no sooner than 3&#160;months postoperatively, once the refraction has stabilized. A patient with significant corneal haze and regression after surface ablation is at higher risk after re-&#173;treatment for further regression, recurrence, or worsening of the corneal haze, as well as loss of best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA; also called <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity, CDVA</span>). It is recommended that the surgeon wait at least 6–12&#160;months for the haze to improve spontaneously before repeating surface ablation. In patients with significant haze and myopic regression, removal of the haze with adjunctive use of mitomycin&#160;C should not be coupled with a refractive treatment, as the resolution of the haze will commonly improve the refractive outcome. Undercorrection after LASIK typically requires flap lift and laser treatment of the residual refractive error after the refraction has remained stable for at least 3&#160;months. Cases of delayed and progressive regression, especially with concomitant development of irregular astigmatism, may suggest ectasia, or, in an older patient, refractive shift due to the development of cataract.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Optical Aberrations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After undergoing surface ablation or LASIK, some patients report symptoms related to optical aberrations, including glare, ghost images, and halos. These symptoms are most prevalent after treatment with smaller ablation zones (&lt;6.0&#160;mm in diameter), after attempted higher spherical and cylindrical correction, and in patients with symptoms prior to refractive surgery. These vision problems seem to be exacerbated in dim-light conditions when mydriasis occurs. Wavefront mapping can reveal higher-&#173;order aberrations associated with these subjective concerns. In general, a larger, more uniform, and well-&#173;centered optical zone provides a better quality of vision, especially at night.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Night-&#173;vision concerns are often the result of spherical aberration, although other higher-&#173;order aberrations also contribute. The cornea and lens have inherent spherical aberration. In addition, excimer laser ablation increases positive spherical aberration in the midperipheral cornea. Wavefront-guided and optimized corneal treatment patterns are designed to reduce existing aberrations and to help prevent the creation of new aberrations, with the goal of achieving a better quality of vision after laser ablation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the excimer laser photoablation causes most of the post-&#173;LASIK changes in lower- and higher-&#173;order aberrations, several studies have demonstrated that the creation of the flap itself can also result in aberrations (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-1</span>). Some studies have demonstrated that femtosecond lasers cause little or no change in higher-&#173;order aberrations, in contrast to mechanical microkeratomes. Pallikaris showed that LASIK flap creation alone, without lifting, caused no significant change in refractive error or visual acuity but did cause a significant increase in total higher-&#173;order wavefront aberrations.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Central Islands</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A central island is defined as a steepening of at least 1.00&#160;D with a diameter of less than 1&#160;mm compared with the paracentral flattened area. A central island appears on computerized corneal topography as an area of central corneal steepening surrounded by an area of flattening that corresponds to the myopic treatment zone in the paracentral region (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-2</span>). Central islands may be associated with decreased visual acuity, monocular diplopia and multiplopia, ghost images, and decreased contrast sensitivity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The occurrence of central islands has been reduced significantly through the use of scanning and variable-&#173;spot-size lasers and is now rarely encountered with modern laser technology. Fortunately, most central islands diminish over time, especially after surface ablation, although resolution may take 6–12&#160;months. Treatment options such as topography-&#173;guided ablations may be helpful in treating persistent central islands.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Decentered Ablations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Accurate centration during the excimer laser procedure is important in optimizing the visual results. Centration is even more crucial for hyperopic than myopic treatments. A decentered ablation may occur if the patient’s eye slowly begins to drift and loses fixation, if the surgeon initially positions the patient’s head improperly, or if the patient’s eye is not perpendicular to the laser treatment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-3</span>). The incidence of decentration increases with surgeon inexperience, hyperopic ablations, and higher refractive correction, due to longer ablation times. Decentration may be reduced by ensuring that the patient’s head remains in the correct plane throughout the treatment—that is, perpendicular to the laser (parallel to the ground)—and that there is no head tilt. Treatment of decentration with topography-&#173;guided technology, and/or with the use of masking agents may be effective.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Corticosteroid-Induced Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The incidence of increased intraocular pressure (IOP) after surface ablation has been reported to range from 11% to 25%. Occasionally, the IOP may be quite high. In 1&#160;study, 2% of patients had a postoperative IOP greater than 40&#160;mm Hg. Most cases of elevated IOP are associated with prolonged topical corticosteroid therapy. Accordingly, postoperative corticosteroid-&#173;associated IOP elevations are more likely to occur after surface ablation (after which corticosteroid therapy may be used for 2–4&#160;months to prevent postoperative corneal haze) or after complicated LASIK cases. Corticosteroid-&#173;induced elevated IOP occurs in 1.5%–3.0% of patients using fluorometholone but in up to 25% of patients using dexamethasone. The increase in IOP is usually controlled with topical IOP-&#173;lowering medications and typically normalizes after the corticosteroids are decreased or discontinued. Because of the changes in corneal curvature and/or corneal thickness, Goldmann tonometry readings after myopic surface ablation and LASIK are artifactually reduced (see Glaucoma After Refractive Surgery in Chapter&#160;11). Several alternative techniques of measuring IOP have been suggested, but dynamic contour tonometry is the only technique shown to have sufficient reproducible accuracy in eyes after refractive ablation. In addition, with high IOP, fluid can collect in the flap interface and mask dangerously high IOPs, as applanation devices will artifactually measure the pressure of the fluid chamber created between the stroma and the LASIK flap. Other corticosteroid-&#173;associated complications that have been reported after surface ablation are reactivation of herpes simplex virus keratitis, ptosis, and cataracts.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Central Toxic Keratopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Central toxic keratopathy is a rare, acute, noninflammatory central corneal opacification that can occur within days after uneventful LASIK or PRK (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-4</span>). The etiology is unknown but may be related to enzymatic degradation of keratocytes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Confocal microscopy has demonstrated activated keratocytes without inflammatory cells, with initial keratocyte loss from the stromal bed and gradual repopulation over time. Central toxic keratopathy has been reported to result in anterior curvature flattening without alteration of posterior curvature in anterior segment tomography; however, some cases do appear to alter all tomographic findings, likely as measurement artifact. The onset is acute without worsening over time, unlike in most other interface entities.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Marked hyperopic shift is often observed and tends to resolve over time. Enhancement can be deferred in these cases until refractive stability is achieved and the clinical findings have resolved. The use of topical hypertonic solutions for the treatment of central toxic keratopathy has been proposed in anecdotal reports.</p>

			<p class="h2">Infectious Keratitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infectious keratitis may occur after surface ablation procedures or LASIK, as both types of surgery involve disturbance of the ocular surface (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-5</span>). As a result, eyelid preparation and proper draping are recommended. The risk of infection varies depending on the specific technique, with surface ablation more commonly at risk of postoperative infection compared to LASIK. The most common etiologic agents for these infections are gram-&#173;positive organisms, including <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus,</span> methicillin-&#173;resistant <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> <span class="italic">(MRSA),</span> <span class="italic">Streptococcus pneumoniae,</span> and <span class="italic">Streptococcus viridans.</span> Although health care workers and others exposed in hospital and nursing home settings may be at greatest risk for MRSA infection, MRSA infections have been diagnosed in increasing numbers of cases without known risk factors. Atypical mycobacteria, <span class="italic">Nocardia asteroides,</span> and fungi have also been reported to cause infectious keratitis after surface ablation and LASIK.</p>
			<p class="body-text">PRK and other surface ablation techniques involve creation of an iatrogenic corneal epithelial defect that may take 3–5&#160;days to heal. During this time, the risk of postoperative infectious keratitis is greatest because of exposure of the stroma, use of a bandage contact lens, and administration of topical corticosteroid drops, all of which increase the opportunity for eyelid and conjunctival bacterial flora to gain access to the stroma. Treatment of postoperative infectious keratitis consists of culture and sensitivity testing of contact lens and corneal scrapings and institution of appropriate intensive, topical, broad-&#173;spectrum antibiotic coverage, being cognizant of the higher prevalence of keratitis secondary to gram-&#173;positive organisms. Treatment may require a combination of antimicrobial agents. Fungal keratitis can also occur, especially with concomitant corticosteroid use. With that in mind, cultures should include fungal assays, and treatment for keratitis should include antifungal agents in suspected cases (see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">During or shortly after LASIK, which involves creation of a corneal flap, eyelid and conjunctival flora may enter and remain sequestered under the flap. The antimicrobial components in the tears and in topically applied antibiotic drops have difficulty penetrating into the deep stroma to reach the organisms (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-6</span>). If a post-&#173;LASIK infection is suspected, the surgeon can lift the flap, scrape the stromal bed for culture and sensitivity testing, and irrigate with antibiotics prior to flap repositioning. Intensive treatment with topical antibiotic drops, as described previously, can be started pending culture results. If there is lack of clinical progress, additional scrapings and irrigation may be necessary, the flap may be amputated, and the antibiotic regimen may be altered.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Complications Unique to Surface Ablation</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Persistent Epithelial Defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Usually, the epithelial defect created during surface ablation heals within 3 or 4&#160;days with the aid of a bandage contact lens. A frequent cause of delayed reepithelialization is keratoconjunctivitis sicca or other tear film abnormalities. Proper diagnosis and targeted treatment are critical. Treatment options include aggressive nonpreserved lubrication, topical cyclosporine, temporary punctal occlusion, amniotic membrane grafting, and autologous serum drops. Patients who have autoimmune connective tissue disease or diabetes mellitus or who smoke may also have poor epithelial healing and may require a more aggressive approach. Topical nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be discontinued in patients with delayed reepithelialization. Nonpreserved drops are preferable. Oral tetracycline-&#173;family antibiotics may be beneficial for persistent epithelial defects because they inhibit collagenase activity and in turn improve wound healing. In some cases, epithelial healing may be impaired by the presence of necrotic epithelium on the corneal surface. Gentle debridement of the necrotic epithelial border can promote reepithelialization. The importance of closely monitoring patients until re-&#173;epithelialization occurs cannot be overemphasized, as a persistent epithelial defect increases the risk of corneal haze, irregular astigmatism, refractive instability, delayed recovery of vision, and infectious keratitis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Sterile Infiltrates</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The use of bandage contact lenses to aid epithelial healing is associated with sterile infiltrates, which may occur more frequently in patients using topical NSAIDs for longer than 24&#160;hours without concomitant topical corticosteroids. The infiltrates, which have been reported in approximately 1 in 300&#160;cases, are secondary to an immune reaction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-7</span>). They are treated with institution of topical corticosteroids, tapering and discontinuation of topical NSAIDs, and close follow-&#173;up. Any infiltrate may be infectious and should be monitored and managed appropriately. If infectious keratitis is suspected, the cornea is typically scraped and cultured for suspected organisms.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Corneal Haze</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The presentation of wound healing after surface ablation is important in determining postoperative topical corticosteroid management. Eyes that have haze and are undercorrected may benefit from increased corticosteroid use. After surface ablation, eyes with clear corneas that are overcorrected may benefit from a reduction in topical corticosteroids, which may lead to regression of the overcorrection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When present, subepithelial corneal haze typically appears several weeks after surface ablation, peaks in intensity at 1–2&#160;months, and gradually diminishes or disappears over the following 6–12&#160;months (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-8</span>). <span class="italic">Late-&#173;onset corneal haze</span> may occur several months or even a year or more postoperatively after a period in which the patient had a relatively clear cornea. Histologic studies in animals with corneal haze after PRK demonstrate abnormal glycosaminoglycans and/or nonlamellar collagen deposited in the anterior stroma as a consequence of epithelial–stromal wound healing. Most histologic studies from animals and humans show an increase in the number and activity of stromal keratocytes, which suggests that increased keratocyte activity may be the source of the extracellular deposits.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Persistent severe haze is usually associated with greater amounts of correction or smaller ablation zones. Animal studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet&#160;B exposure after PRK prolongs the stromal healing process, with an increase in subepithelial haze. Clinical cases of haze after high ultraviolet exposure (such as at high altitude) corroborate these studies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If clinically unacceptable haze persists, a superficial keratectomy or phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) may be performed. In addition, topical mitomycin&#160;C (0.02%), with PTK or debridement, may be used to prevent recurrence of subepithelial fibrosis. Because haze is known to resolve spontaneously with normal wound remodeling, re-&#173;ablation should be delayed for at least 6–12&#160;months. The clinician should be aware that, in the presence of haze, refraction is often inaccurate, typically with an overestimation of the amount of myopia.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Complications Unique to LASIK</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The complications associated with LASIK are primarily related to flap creation, postoperative flap positioning, or interface problems.</p>
			<p class="h2">Microkeratome Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the past, the more severe complications associated with LASIK were related to problems with the manual microkeratome, which caused the planned LASIK procedure to be abandoned in an estimated 0.6%–1.6% of cases. In current practice, advances in microkeratome technology and the advent of femtosecond laser–created flaps have substantially reduced the incidence of severe, sight-&#173;threatening complications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When a manual microkeratome is used, meticulous care must be taken in the cleaning and assembly of the instrument to ensure a smooth, uninterrupted keratectomy. Defects in the blade, poor suction, or uneven progression of the microkeratome across the cornea can produce an irregular, thin, or buttonhole flap (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-9</span>), which can result in irregular astigmatism with loss of BCVA. Steep corneal curvature can result in a nonuniform fit of the keratome suction device, exposing additional corneal surface area to the cutting blade, leading to the risk of thin, irregular, or buttonhole flaps. If a thin or buttonhole flap is created, or if an incomplete flap does not provide a sufficiently large corneal stromal surface to perform the laser ablation, the flap should be replaced and the ablation should not be performed. Substantial loss of vision can be prevented if, under such circumstances, the ablation is not performed and the flap is allowed to heal before another refractive procedure is attempted, typically 3–6&#160;months later. In such cases, a bandage contact lens is applied to stabilize the flap, typically for several days to a week. Although a new flap can usually be cut safely using a deeper cut after at least 3&#160;months of healing, most surgeons prefer to use a surface ablation technique.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Occasionally, a free cap is created instead of a hinged flap (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-10</span>). In these cases, if the stromal bed is large enough to accommodate the laser treatment, the corneal cap is placed in a moist chamber while the ablation is performed. It is important to replace the cap with the epithelial side up and to position it properly on a dried stromal bed, using the previously placed radial marks. A temporary 10-0&#160;nylon suture can be placed to create an artificial hinge, but the physiologic dehydration of the stroma by the endothelial pump will generally keep the cap secured in proper position. A bandage contact lens can help protect the cap. A flat corneal curvature (&lt;40.00&#160;D) is a risk factor for creating a free cap because the flap diameter is often smaller than average in flat corneas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal perforation is a rare but devastating intraoperative complication that can occur if the microkeratome is not properly assembled or if the depth plate in an older-&#173;model microkeratome is not properly placed. It is imperative for the surgeon to double-&#173;check that the microkeratome has been properly assembled before beginning the procedure. Modern microkeratomes are constructed with a prefixed depth plate, which eliminates this source of error. Corneal perforation can also occur when LASIK is performed on an excessively thin cornea. Corneal thickness must be measured with pachymetry prior to the LASIK procedure, especially in patients who are undergoing re-&#173;treatment.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Epithelial Sloughing or Defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The friction of microkeratome passage across the pressurized cornea may loosen a sheet of epithelium (termed <span class="italic">epithelial slough</span>) or cause a frank epithelial defect. Although patients with epithelial basement membrane dystrophy are at particular risk—in which case surface ablation rather than LASIK is advisable—other patients show no preoperative epithelial abnormalities. The risk of epithelial abnormality during LASIK correlates with older age. Also, in bilateral LASIK procedures with mechanical microkeratomes, the second eye has a greater likelihood of sustaining an epithelial defect (57%) if an intraoperative epithelial defect developed in the first eye. Techniques suggested to decrease the rate of epithelial defects include limiting medications to avoid toxicity, using chilled proparacaine, minimizing use of topical anesthetic, using nonpreserved drops until just before performing the skin prep or starting the procedure, having patients keep their eyes closed after topical anesthetic is administered, frequent use of corneal lubricating drops, meticulous microkeratome maintenance, and shutting off suction on the microkeratome reverse pass. The femtosecond laser is associated with a reduced incidence of epithelial defects because there is no microkeratome movement across the epithelium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In cases of significant epithelial defects, a bandage contact lens is often applied immediately postoperatively and retained until stable reepithelialization occurs, with subsequent use of intensive lubricants and, occasionally, punctal occlusion. Persistent abnormal epithelium with recurrent erosions or loss of BCVA may require debridement and even superficial PTK using the technique employed for treatment of recurrent erosions (see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea</span>). Epithelial defects are associated with an increased incidence of postoperative diffuse lamellar keratitis, infectious keratitis, flap striae, and epithelial ingrowth, and surgeons should watch closely for these conditions.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Flap Striae</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Flap folds, or striae, are a potential cause of decreased visual quality or acuity after LASIK. When present, most (56%) flap folds are noted on the first postoperative day, and 95% are noted within the first week. Risk factors for development of folds include excessive irrigation under the flap during LASIK, thin flaps, and deep ablations with mismatch of the flap to the new bed. Recognition of visually significant folds is important. Early intervention is often crucial in treating folds that cause loss of BCVA or visual distortion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The first step in evaluating a patient with corneal folds is determining the BCVA. Folds are not treated if the BCVA and the subjective visual acuity are good. Folds are examined with a slit lamp using direct illumination, retroillumination, and fluorescein staining. Circumferential folds may be associated with high myopia and typically resolve with time. Folds that are parallel and emanate from the flap hinge grouped in the same direction indicate flap slippage, which requires prompt intervention. Corneal topography is usually not helpful in diagnosing folds.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Folds are often categorized as either macrostriae or microstriae, although there is significant overlap between these types (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-1</span>). <span class="italic">Macrostriae</span> represent full-&#173;thickness, undulating stromal folds. These folds invariably occur because of initial flap malposition or postoperative flap slippage (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-11A</span>). Current approaches to smoothing the flap and avoiding striae at the end of the LASIK procedure vary widely. No matter which technique is used, however, the surgeon must carefully examine for the presence of striae once the flap is repositioned. The surgeon can apply momentary medical grade compressed air and instruct the patient to not overly squeeze the eyelids upon removal of the speculum. Coaxial and oblique illumination should be used at the operating microscope to examine for striae. Macrostriae may occur as patients attempt to squeeze their eyelids shut when the speculum and drape are removed. Accordingly, before removing the speculum, the surgeon should instruct the patient to actively suppress the otherwise natural reflex to squeeze the eyelids at this stage. Checking the patient in the early postoperative period is important to detect flap slippage. A protective plastic shield is often used for the first 24&#160;hours to discourage the patient from touching the eyelids and inadvertently disrupting the flap.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Flap dislocation has been reported to occur in up to 1.4% of eyes. Careful examination will disclose a wider gutter on the side where the folds are most prominent. Flap slippage should be rectified as soon as it is recognized because the folds rapidly become fixed. Under the operating microscope or at the slit lamp, an eyelid speculum is placed, the flap is lifted and repositioned, copious irrigation with sterile balanced salt solution is used in the interface, and the flap is repeatedly stroked perpendicular to the fold until the striae resolve or improve. Using hypotonic saline or sterile distilled water as the interface-&#173;irrigating solution swells the flap and may initially reduce the striae, but swelling also reduces the flap diameter, which widens the gutter, delays flap adhesion because of prolonged endothelial dehydration time, and may worsen the striae after the flap dehydrates. If the macrostriae have been present for more than 24&#160;hours, reactive epithelial hyperplasia in the valleys and hypoplasia over the elevations of the macrostriae tend to fix the folds into position. In such a case, in addition to refloating of the flap, the central 6&#160;mm of the flap over the macrostriae may be de-&#173;epithelialized to remove this impediment to smoothing the wrinkles. A bandage contact lens should be used to stabilize the flap and to protect the surface until full reepithelialization occurs. In cases of intractable macrostriae, a tight 360° antitorque running suture or multiple interrupted sutures using 10-0&#160;nylon may be placed and retained for several weeks, but irregular astigmatism may still be present after suture removal.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Microstriae</span> are fine, hairlike optical irregularities that are best viewed on red reflex illumination or by light reflected off the iris (Fig&#160;6-11). They are very small folds in the Bowman layer, and this anterior location accounts for the disruption of BCVA in some eyes. Computer topographic color maps do not usually show these subtle irregularities. However, disruption of the surface contour may result in irregularity of the Placido disk image. In addition, application of dilute fluorescein often reveals so-called <span class="italic">negative staining,</span> in which the elevated striae disrupt the tear film and fluorescence is lost over them.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If optically significant microstriae persist, the flap may be sutured in an attempt to reduce the striae by means of tension. As with macrostriae, however, suturing has the potential to induce new irregular astigmatism. An alternative procedure is PTK. Pulses from a broad-beam laser, set to a maximal diameter of 6.5&#160;mm, are initially applied to penetrate the epithelium in about 200&#160;pulses. The epithelium acts as a masking agent, exposing the elevated striae before the valleys between the striae. After the transepithelial ablation, additional pulses are applied, and a thin film of medium-&#173;viscosity artificial tears is administered every 5–10&#160;pulses, up to a maximum of 100&#160;additional pulses. If these suggestions are followed, little to no haze results, and an average hyperopic shift of less than +1.00&#160;D occurs as a result of the minimal tissue removal.</p>

			<p class="h2">Traumatic Flap Dislocation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Flap dislocation has been reported to occur in up to 1.4% of eyes. Dislocation of the LASIK flap is not uncommon on the first postoperative day, when dryness and adhesion of the flap to the upper tarsal conjunctiva are sufficient to cause the flap to slip. After the first day, however, the reepithelialization of the gutter begins the process of increasing flap stability. Within several weeks, keratocytes begin to lay down new collagen at the cut edge of the Bowman layer, and eventually a fine scar is established at the edge of the flap. However, minimal healing occurs across the stromal interface. Late dislocation from blunt trauma has been reported many years after LASIK. This can occur if the shearing force exceeds the strength of the peripheral Bowman layer–level healing. Flap dislocation requires urgent treatment to replace the flap in its proper anatomical position. The surgeon should make sure that there is no epithelium on the underside of the flap or in the interface, a situation that significantly increases the chances of epithelial ingrowth.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">LASIK-&#173;Interface Complications</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Diffuse lamellar keratitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The presentation of diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-12</span>) can range from asymptomatic interface haze near the edge of the flap to marked diffuse haze under the center of the flap with decreased BCVA. The condition represents a nonspecific sterile inflammatory response to a variety of mechanical and toxic insults. The interface under the flap is a potential space; any cause of anterior stromal inflammation may trigger the accumulation of white blood cells therein. DLK has been reported in association with epithelial defects that occur during primary LASIK or during enhancement, or even months after the LASIK procedure from corneal abrasions or infectious keratitis. Other reported inciting factors include foreign material on the surface of the microkeratome blade or motor, trapped meibomian gland secretions, povidone-&#173;iodine solution (from the preoperative skin preparation), marking ink, substances produced by laser ablation, contamination of the sterilizer with gram-&#173;negative endotoxin, and red blood cells in the interface. The inflammation generally resolves with topical corticosteroid treatment alone without sequelae, but severe cases can lead to scarring or flap melting; therefore, early detection and management is important.</p>
			<p class="body-text">DLK is typically classified by the stages described in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-2</span>. Although stages&#160;1 and 2 usually respond to frequent topical corticosteroid application, stages&#160;3 and 4 usually require lifting the flap and irrigating, followed by intensive topical corticosteroid treatment. Oral corticosteroids may be used adjunctively in severe cases. Some surgeons use topical and systemic corticosteroids in stage&#160;3 DLK instead of, or in addition to, lifting the flap. Recovery of vision in DLK is usually excellent if the condition is detected and treated promptly.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A surgeon should have a low threshold for lifting or irrigating underneath the flap in suspected cases of severe DLK. Lifting the flap allows removal of inflammatory mediators from the interface and direct placement of corticosteroids and NSAIDs to suppress inflammation and necrosis. If there is any suspicion that the inflammation is due to infection, lifting the flap and obtaining samples for corneal cultures of the interface should be considered. Topical antibiotics can also be placed in the flap interface at the same time. In cases of suspected DLK not responsive to corticosteroids within 7–10&#160;days of initiation, the diagnosis should be reconsidered, as infectious keratitis or pressure-&#173;induced stromal keratopathy (PISK, discussed later) can mimic DLK and require corticosteroid cessation.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">LASIK infectious keratitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is important to differentiate sterile interface inflammation from potentially devastating infectious inflammation. Increased pain and decreased vision are the primary indicators of infection. However, postoperative discomfort is common, so it is difficult for patients to distinguish between normal and abnormal eye pain. Moreover, because corneal nerves are severed during flap creation, corneal sensation may be reduced, along with the subjective symptom of pain that usually accompanies infection. Infection after LASIK is usually associated with redness, photophobia, and decreased vision. Several distinct features can help distinguish between DLK and infectious keratitis (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-3</span>). DLK is usually visible with slit lamp biomicroscopy within 24&#160;hours of surgery and typically begins at the periphery of the flap. There is usually a gradient of inflammation, with the inflammation being most intense at the periphery and diminishing toward the center of the cornea. In general, the inflammatory reaction in DLK is diffusely distributed but localized and confined to the area of the flap interface; it does not extend far beyond the edge of the flap (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-13</span>). In contrast, post-&#173;LASIK infectious keratitis usually begins 2 or 3&#160;days after surgery and involves a more focal inflammatory reaction that is not confined to the lamellar interface. An anterior chamber reaction may further help differentiate between an infectious and a sterile process. The inflammatory reaction can extend up into the flap, deeper into the stromal bed, and even beyond the confines of the flap.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Infection within the interface can lead to flap melting, severe irregular astigmatism, and corneal scarring that may require corneal transplantation. If infection is suspected, the flap should be lifted and the interface cultured and irrigated with antibiotics. The most common infections are from gram-&#173;positive organisms, followed in frequency by those caused by atypical mycobacteria. Mycobacterial infection can be diagnosed more rapidly by using acid-fast and fluorochrome stains rather than by waiting for culture results (see Fig&#160;6-5).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, the timing of the onset of symptoms provides a clue as to the etiology of the infection. Infections occurring within 10&#160;days of surgery are typically bacterial, with the preponderance being from gram-&#173;positive organisms (see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Corne</span><span class="italic">a</span>). If the infection does not respond to treatment, amputation of the flap may be necessary to improve antimicrobial penetration. The fourth-&#173;generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin have excellent efficacy against the more common bacteria that cause post-&#173;LASIK infections, including some atypical mycobacteria; however, monotherapy with these drugs may not be sufficient. A LASIK flap infection may occur after a recurrent erosion (see Fig&#160;6-6).</p>

			<p class="h3">Pressure-induced stromal keratopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A diffuse stromal and interface opacity termed <span class="italic">pressure-&#173;induced stromal keratopathy (PISK)</span> has been reported as a result of elevated IOP; it can be mistaken for DLK and is sometimes associated with a visible fluid cleft in the interface (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-14</span>). The surgeon must be aware of this rare condition in order to properly diagnose and treat it. The pressure-&#173;induced haze from PISK is associated with prolonged corticosteroid treatment and usually presents after 10&#160;days to 2&#160;weeks. Key differentiators between DLK and PISK are that with DLK, the onset is earlier and the IOP is not elevated. IOP should be measured both centrally and peripherally in suspected cases, possibly with a pneumotonometer or Tono-Pen (Reichert Technologies, Depew, NY), because applanation pressure may be falsely lowered centrally in PISK by fluid accumulation in the lamellar interface. Several alternative techniques of measuring IOP have been suggested, but dynamic contour tonometry is the only technique shown to have sufficient reproducible accuracy in eyes that have undergone refractive ablation. Treatment of PISK involves rapid cessation of corticosteroid drops and the use of glaucoma medications to lower IOP. Severe glaucomatous vision loss has been reported in cases with delayed diagnosis.</p>

			<p class="h3">Epithelial ingrowth</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epithelial ingrowth occurs in less than 3% of eyes (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-15</span>). There is no need to treat isolated nests of epithelial cells in the peripheral lamellar interface that are not advancing and are not affecting vision. However, if the epithelium is advancing toward the visual axis, is associated with decreased vision from irregular astigmatism (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-16</span>), or triggers overlying flap melting, it should be removed by lifting the flap, scraping the epithelium from both the underside of the flap and the stromal bed, and then repositioning the flap. After scraping the under-&#173;flap surface and stromal bed, some surgeons also remove epithelium from both the periphery of the flap and the bed to allow for flap adherence before the epithelial edge advances to the flap edge. Recurrent epithelial ingrowth can be treated with repeated lifting and scraping, with or without flap suturing or using fibrin glue at the flap edge. Some surgeons treat the undersurface of the flap with absolute alcohol to identify and treat any residual epithelium. Nd:YAG laser has also been described to treat early epithelial ingrowth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The incidence of epithelial ingrowth is greater in eyes that develop an epithelial defect at the time of the procedure, undergo a re-&#173;treatment with lifting of a preexisting flap, or have traumatic flap dehiscence. In such cases, special care should be taken to ensure that no epithelium is caught under the edge of the flap when it is repositioned. Placement of a bandage contact lens at the conclusion of the procedure may also decrease the incidence of epithelial ingrowth for patients at higher risk of developing this complication.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Interface debris</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Debris in the interface is occasionally observed postoperatively. The principal indication for intervention by flap lifting, irrigation, and manual removal of debris is an inflammatory reaction elicited by the foreign material. Small amounts of lint, nondescript particles, or tiny metal particles from stainless steel surgical instruments are usually well tolerated. A small amount of blood that may have oozed into the interface from transected peripheral vessels may also be tolerated and typically resolves spontaneously with time; however, a significant amount of blood usually elicits an inflammatory cell response and should be irrigated from the interface at the time of the LASIK procedure (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-17</span>). Use of a topical vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine applied with a fiber-&#173;free sponge to facilitate constriction when the flap is being replaced helps minimize this problem. The surgeon should be aware that applying epinephrine prior to laser ablation can result in pupillary dilation, difficulty for the patient to fixate on a fixation light, and thus treatment decentration.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Complications Related to Femtosecond Laser LASIK Flaps</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Opaque bubble layer and possible sequelae</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">One of the most common adverse effects of the intrastromal photo-&#173;disruption procedure is the generation of opaque bubble layer (OBL). This bubble layer, created as a result of tissue disruption by the femtosecond laser, is composed of carbon dioxide and water. Laser tracking systems can be significantly impaired by the OBL. Time and/or mechanical massage will allow for OBL to dissipate. Newer-&#173;generation femtosecond lasers with higher repetition rates tend to create fewer OBLs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Epithelial gas breakthrough is a rare but serious complication of OBL production. Similar to a buttonhole from a mechanical keratome, the breakthrough should be allowed to heal and stabilize generally for at least 3&#160;months, at which time surface ablation may be considered.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In rare cases, the gas liberated from the plasma cavitations can travel into the anterior chamber, potentially interfering with the laser tracking systems. If this occurs, the surgeon can allow a few hours for the bubbles to resolve. In addition, instillation of a mydriatic drop may allow the pupil to begin to dilate around the bubbles, which can allow laser recognition and capture.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Transient light sensitivity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several weeks to months after LASIK with femtosecond laser flaps, some patients experience acute onset of pain and light sensitivity in an otherwise white and quiet eye with excellent uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA; also called <span class="italic">uncorrected distance visual acuity, UDVA</span>). The cornea and flap interface appear normal. It has been speculated that an acute onset of ocular inflammation or dry eyes is somehow related to use of the femtosecond laser. Treatment consists of frequent administration of topical corticosteroids (eg, prednisolone acetate, 1%, every 2&#160;hours) and topical cyclosporine A, titrated to the clinical condition. Almost all cases respond to treatment and resolve in weeks to months.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Rainbow glare</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rainbow glare, an optical adverse effect of treatment with the femtosecond laser, is described as bands of color around white lights at night.

			<p class="h1">Ectasia</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal ectasia develops after excimer laser ablation when the corneal biomechanical integrity is reduced beyond its functional threshold; this complication results from performing surgery in patients who either are otherwise predisposed to developing corneal ectatic disorders or have a significantly reduced postablation residual stromal bed (RSB). The importance of an adequate RSB to prevent structural instability and postoperative corneal ectasia is discussed in Chapter&#160;2. Ectasia has been reported far more frequently after LASIK than after surface ablation. Cumulative analysis of more than 200&#160;eyes with postoperative ectasia found that ectasia is usually associated with LASIK performed in patients with preoperative topographic abnormalities. Other risk factors include younger patient age, thinner corneas, higher myopic corrections, and patients who have undergone several laser ablations. However, cases of ectasia without any demonstrable risk factors have also been reported.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For postoperative ectasia, corneal crosslinking (CCL) is becoming the first-line treatment worldwide. In 2016 its use was approved by the US&#160;Food and Drug Administration. Often, functional visual acuity can be restored with rigid gas-&#173;permeable or hybrid contact lens wear. The implantation of symmetric or asymmetric intrastromal ring segments to reduce the irregular astigmatism has been successful in select cases. In extreme cases, corneal transplantation may be required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In 2005, a joint statement was issued by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the International Society for Refractive Surgery, and the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery summarizing current knowledge of corneal ectatic disorders and ectasia after LASIK. Their 8&#160;conclusions at the time were</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-6">&#9;1.&#9;No specific test or measurement is diagnostic of a corneal ectatic disorder.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;2.&#9;A decision to perform LASIK should take into account the entire clinical picture, not just the corneal topography.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;3.&#9;Although some risk factors have been suggested for ectasia after LASIK, none is an absolute predictor of its occurrence.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;4.&#9;Because keratoconus may develop in the absence of refractive surgery, the occurrence of ectasia after LASIK does not necessarily mean that LASIK was a causative or contributing factor for its development.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;5.&#9;Risk factors for ectasia after LASIK may not also predict ectasia after surface ablation.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">&#9;6.&#9;Ectasia is a known risk of laser vision correction.</p>

			<p class="numbered-list-last">&#9;8.&#9;Although to date no formal guidelines exist and good scientific data for future guidelines are presently lacking, in order to reduce some of the risks of ectasia after LASIK, the groups recommended that surgeons review topographic findings prior to surgery.
