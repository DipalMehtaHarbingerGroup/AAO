			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Incisional refractive surgery for treatment of myopia has largely been replaced by other modalities, but is still used for treatment of primary astigmatism during cataract surgery and residual astigmatism after both cataract and keratorefractive surgery (limbal relaxing incisions) and following penetrating keratoplasty (arcuate keratotomy). In fact, the use of incisional surgery, both traditional and intrastromal, has increased significantly with the advent of refractive cataract surgery utilizing femtosecond laser platforms and multifocal lens implants.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The history of incisional keratotomy dates back to the 1890s. Lans examined astigmatic changes induced in rabbits after partial-&#173;thickness corneal incisions and thermal cautery. Sato made significant contributions to incisional refractive surgery in the 1930s and 1940s. He observed central corneal flattening and improvement in vision after the healing of spontaneous ruptures of the Descemet membrane (corneal hydrops) in patients with advanced keratoconus, which led him to develop a technique to induce artificial ruptures of the Descemet membrane. His long-term results in humans were poor, because incisions were made posteriorly through the Descemet layer, leading to endothelial cell failure and corneal edema in 75% of patients. In the 1960s and 1970s, Fyodorov, using radial incisions on the anterior cornea, established that the diameter of the central optical clear zone was inversely related to the amount of refractive correction: smaller central clear zones yield greater myopic corrections.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Radial Keratotomy in the United States</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Radial keratotomy (RK) is now largely considered an obsolete procedure, but it did play an important role in the history of refractive surgery. RK differs from surface ablation/photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) in that it does not involve removal of tissue from the central cornea; rather, there is a redistribution of power from the center to the periphery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To evaluate the safety and efficacy of RK, the Prospective Evaluation of Radial Keratotomy (PERK) study was undertaken in 1982 for patients with myopia from –2.00&#160;D to –8.75&#160;D (mean, –3.875&#160;D). The sole surgical variable was the diameter of the central optical clear zone (3.00, 3.50, or 4.00&#160;mm), based on the level of preoperative myopia. Ten years after the procedure, 53% of the 435&#160;study patients had 20/20 or better uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA; also called <span class="italic">uncorrected distance visual acuity, UDVA</span>) and 85% had 20/40 or better. In addition, the older the patient, the greater the effect achieved with the same surgical technique. The most important finding in the 10-year PERK study was the continuing long-term instability of the procedure. A hyperopic shift of 1.00&#160;D or greater was found in 43% of eyes between 6&#160;months and 10&#160;years postoperatively.</p>

			<p class="h3">Surgical technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Radial corneal incisions sever collagen fibrils in the corneal stroma. This produces a wound gape with midperipheral bulging of the cornea, compensatory central corneal flattening, and decreased refractive power, thereby decreasing myopia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The design of the diamond-&#173;blade knife (angle and sharpness of cutting edge, width of blade, and design of footplate) influenced both the depth and the contour of incisions. The ideal depth of RK incisions is 85%–90% of the corneal thickness.</p>
			<p class="h3">Postoperative refraction, visual acuity, and corneal topography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Radial keratotomy changes not only the curvature of the central cornea but also its overall topography, creating an oblate cornea—flatter in the center and steeper in the periphery. The procedure reduces myopia but increases spherical aberration. The result is less correlation among refraction, central keratometry, and UCVA, presumably because the new corneal curvature creates a more complex, multifocal optical system. The effect is that keratometric readings, which sample a limited number of points approximately 3.0&#160;mm apart, might show degrees of astigmatism that differ from those detected by refraction. Also, central corneal flattening affects intraocular lens (IOL) power calculations for cataract surgery (discussed later in this chapter and in Chapter&#160;11).</p>
			<p class="h3">Stability of refraction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most eyes were generally stable by 3&#160;months after RK surgery. However, diurnal fluctuation of vision and a progressive flattening effect after surgery have been known to persist, resulting in refractive instability.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Diurnal fluctuation of vision</span> occurs due to hypoxic edema of the incisions with the eyelids closed during sleep. This edema causes flattening of the cornea (and hyperopic shift) upon awakening, followed by steepening later in the day. In a subset of the PERK study at 10&#160;years, the mean change in the spherical equivalent of refraction between the morning (waking) and evening examinations was an increase of 0.31 ± 0.58&#160;D in minus power.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">progressive flattening effect of surgery</span> was one of the major untoward results described in the PERK study. Greater hyperopic shift was noted with smaller optical zones. The potential stabilizing effect of corneal crosslinking (CCL) is currently being studied.</p>

			<p class="h3">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">After RK surgery, 1%–3% of eyes experienced loss of 2 or more lines of Snellen visual acuity. This effect was due to induction of irregular astigmatism from hypertrophic scarring, intersecting radial and transverse incisions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-2</span>), and central clear zones smaller than 3.0&#160;mm.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many patients reported the appearance of starburst, glare, or halo effects around lights at night after RK. Treatment with drugs that promote pupillary constriction, such as pilocarpine, or decrease pupillary dilation, such as brimonidine may be able to reduce symptoms by keeping the pupillary diameter within the central optical clear zone. Other complications included fluctuation in vision and loss of best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA; also called <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity, CDVA</span>), induced astigmatism due to epithelial plugs and wound gape (see Fig&#160;3-2), vascularization of stromal scars, and nonprogressive endothelial disruption beneath the incisions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Potentially blinding complications occurred only rarely after RK. These included perforation of the cornea, which can lead to endophthalmitis, epithelial downgrowth, and traumatic cataract. The postoperative use of contact lenses often resulted in vascularization of the incisions, with subsequent scarring and irregular astigmatism. Radial keratotomy incisions remain a point of weakness, and rupture of RK wounds secondary to blunt trauma has been reported up to 13&#160;years after the procedure.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Ocular surgery after radial keratotomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is not uncommon for RK patients to present years later with hyperopia. LASIK and PRK have been shown to be effective in correcting hyperopia and myopia after RK. However, surface ablation may be preferred, as creation of a LASIK flap may result in irregular astigmatism, splaying of the incisions, epithelial ingrowth, as well as loss of sections of the flap, which can be challenging to treat. Surface ablation avoids the LASIK-&#173;related risks after RK but increases the risk of postoperative corneal haze. The off-&#173;label use (in the United States) of mitomycin&#160;C, 0.02% (0.2&#160;mg/mL) applied to the stroma after laser ablation for 12–30&#160;seconds, has dramatically reduced corneal haze after RK and other prior corneal surgical procedures (eg, corneal transplant and LASIK). The drug should be copiously irrigated from the eye so that toxic effects are reduced.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients undergoing laser vision correction for refractive errors after RK need to understand that laser correction will not remove scars caused by RK incisions, so glare or fluctuation symptoms may remain after the laser surgery. In addition, some patients may still experience continued hyperopic progression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In patients with endothelial dystrophy, corneal infection, irregular astigmatism, severe visual fluctuations, or starburst effects, keratoplasty may be needed to restore visual functioning. It should be avoided if the patient’s visual problems can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses (see the section Corneal Transplantation After Refractive Surgery in Chapter&#160;11). If keratoplasty is deemed necessary, before trephination the RK incisions may need to be stabilized with sutures outside the trephine cut. This minimizes the chance of their opening and allows adequate suturing of the donor corneal graft to the recipient bed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cataract extraction with IOL implantation may lead to variable results after RK. In the early postoperative period, corneal edema may result in temporary hyperopia. In addition, IOL power calculation may be problematic and may result in ametropia. Calculation of implant power for cataract surgery after RK should be done by first using a third-&#173;generation formula (eg, Haigis, Hoffer&#160;Q, Holladay&#160;2, or SRK/T) rather than a regression formula (eg, SRK&#160;I or SRK&#160;II) and then choosing the highest resulting IOL power. Keratometric power is determined in 1 of 3&#160;ways: direct measurement using corneal topography; application of pre-RK keratometry value minus the refractive change; or adjustment of the base curve of a plano contact lens by the overrefraction (see the section Eyes With No Preoperative Information in Chapter&#160;11).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A useful online resource for calculating IOL power in a post-RK patient is the post–refractive surgery IOL power calculator available on the website of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (ASCRS), www.ascrs.org, and directly at <a href="http://iolcalc.ascrs.org">http://iolcalc<br />.ascrs.org</a> (see Chapter&#160;11). In addition, modalities such as intraoperative wavefront aberrometry can be used to obtain real-time IOL calculations that may help improve refractive outcomes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Incision placement and construction is vital when performing cataract surgery in the post-RK patient. Scleral tunnel incisions are often preferred, because clear corneal incisions increase the risk of the blade transecting the RK incision, which can induce irregular astigmatism. To help reduce preoperative corneal astigmatism, the surgeon may consider placing the incision in the steep astigmatic meridian of the cornea; in addition, toric IOLs can be used in patients with regular astigmatism but multifocal IOLs should be avoided. At the conclusion of surgery, care should be taken to prevent overhydrating the cataract incisions to avoid rupture of the RK incisions.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Incisional Correction of Astigmatism</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several techniques of incisional surgery have been used to correct astigmatism, including tangential (transverse/straight) keratotomy and arcuate (curved) keratotomy (AK), in which incisions are typically placed in the cornea at the 7-mm optical zone; and limbal relaxing incisions (LRIs), which are placed at the limbus. Tangential keratotomy was used in the past in combination with RK to correct myopic astigmatism, but now is seldom used. AK is used to correct post-&#173;keratoplasty astigmatism. Along with LRIs, AK is used to correct astigmatism during or after cataract surgery and IOL implantation, as well as after refractive surgery procedures such as LASIK and PRK (Video 3-1). Several femtosecond laser platforms have been approved for incisional keratotomies when used for capsulotomy and phacofragmentation of the crystalline lens.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Coupling</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When a single meridian is flattened as a result of an astigmatic incision, a compensatory steepening occurs in the meridian 90° away. This phenomenon is known as <span class="italic">coupling</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-3</span>). When the coupling ratio (the amount of flattening in the meridian of the incision divided by the induced steepening in the opposite meridian) is 1.0, the spherical equivalent remains unchanged. When there is a coupling ratio greater than 1.0, a hyperopic shift occurs. The type of incision (arcuate versus tangential) and the length and number of parallel incisions can influence the coupling ratio. Long, straight, and tangential incisions tend to induce a coupling ratio greater than 1.0, unlike short, arcuate incisions. When a correction is less than 2.00&#160;D of astigmatism, the coupling ratio is typically 1.0; however, when a correction is greater than 2.00&#160;D of astigmatism, the ratio tends to be greater than 1.0. In general, LRIs do not change the spherical equivalent.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Arcuate Keratotomy and Limbal Relaxing Incisions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">AK is an incisional surgical procedure in which arcuate incisions of approximately 95% depth are made in the steep meridians of the midperipheral cornea at the 7–9-mm optical zone. LRIs are incisions set at approximately 600&#160;µm depth, or 50&#160;µm less than <br />the thinnest pachymetry measurement at the limbus. They are placed just anterior to the limbus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-4</span>). AKs differ from LRIs by their midperipheral location and greater relative corneal depth. However, AKs and LRIs are similar in that both have coupling ratios of 1.0 and therefore correct astigmatism without inducing a substantial hyperopic shift. Increasing the length of an LRI increases the magnitude of the astigmatic correction. For AK, the amount of cylindrical correction is increased by increasing the length or depth of the incision, using multiple incisions, or reducing the optical zone (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;3-1</span>). Older patient age is associated with increased effect of astigmatic incisions.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Instrumentation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The instruments used in AKs and LRIs are similar. Adjustable diamond blades are more often used in AKs. Preset diamond blades are more often used in LRI surgical procedures (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-5</span>), although adjustable blades may be used. The femtosecond laser has been adapted to create peripheral arcuate incisions. These incisions may be titratable, as only part of the incision may be opened initially, followed by a larger area later if there is a need for greater astigmatic correction.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Surgical Techniques</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With any astigmatism correction system, accurate determination of the steep meridian is essential. The plus cylinder axis of the manifest refraction is used, as this accounts for corneal and lenticular astigmatism, which are “manifest” in the refraction. If the crystalline lens is to be removed at the time of the astigmatic incisional surgery (ie, LRI), the correction should be based on the steep meridian and magnitude as measured with corneal topography or keratometry. Intraoperative keratoscopy can be helpful in determining incision location and effect. The amount of treatment for a given degree of astigmatism employing LRIs can be determined from one of several nomograms, such as the one shown in Table&#160;3-1.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is prudent to make reference marks, using a surgical marking pen, with the patient sitting up, preferably at the slit lamp (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;3-6</span>). Marking with the patient in this position avoids reference-&#173;mark error due to cyclotorsion of the eyes. Studies have demonstrated that up to 15° of cyclotorsion can occur when patients move from an upright to a supine position. Concomitantly, during cataract surgery, AK incisions may be placed in pairs along the steep meridian, usually between the 7-mm and 9-mm optical zone and, because of induced glare and aberrations, no closer than 3.5&#160;mm from the center of the pupil. LRIs are placed in the peripheral cornea, near the limbus. AK incisions used to correct post–penetrating keratoplasty astigmatism are often made in the graft or in the graft–host junction, but care must be taken to avoid perforation. When AK incisions are made in the host, the effect is significantly reduced. AK incisions in a corneal graft may require compression sutures at the meridian 90° away, and an initial overcorrection is desired in order to compensate for wound healing.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Outcomes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The outcome of AK and LRI surgery depends on several variables, including patient age; the distance separating the incision pairs (optical zone); and the length, depth, and number of incisions. Few large prospective trials have been performed. The Astigmatism Reduction Clinical Trial (ARC-T) of AK, which used a 7-mm optical zone and varying arc lengths, showed a reduction in astigmatism of 1.6 ± 1.1&#160;D in patients with preoperative, naturally occurring astigmatism of 2.8 ± 1.2&#160;D. Other studies of AKs have shown a final UCVA of 20/40 in 65%–80% of eyes. Overcorrections have been reported in 4%–20% of patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Studies of LRIs are limited, but these incisions are frequently used with seemingly good results in astigmatic patients undergoing cataract surgery. One study showed an absolute change in refractive astigmatism of 1.72 ± 0.81&#160;D after LRIs in patients with mixed astigmatism. Astigmatism was decreased by 0.91&#160;D, or 44%, in another series of LRIs in 22&#160;eyes of 13&#160;patients. Incisions in the horizontal meridian have been reported to cause approximately twice as much astigmatic correction as those in the vertical meridian (see Table&#160;3-1).</p>

			<p class="h2">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Irregular astigmatism may occur after either AKs or LRIs; however, it is more common with AKs than with LRIs, presumably because LRIs are farther from the corneal center, thus mitigating any effects of irregular incisions. Off-axis AKs can lead to undercorrection or even worsening of preexisting astigmatism. To avoid creating an edge of cornea that swells and cannot be epithelialized, arcuate incisions and LRIs should not intersect other incisions (see Fig&#160;3-2). Corneal infection and perforation have been reported.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ocular Surgery After Arcuate Keratotomy and Limbal Relaxing Incisions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">AK and LRIs can be combined with or performed after cataract surgery, PRK, and LASIK surgery. Better predictability can be obtained if astigmatic correction is performed after refractive stability is achieved. Penetrating keratoplasty can be done after extensive AK, but the wounds may have to be sutured before trephination, as discussed earlier for RK. A prerequisite for combining LRIs with cataract surgery is the use of astigmatically predictable phacoemulsification.</p>
