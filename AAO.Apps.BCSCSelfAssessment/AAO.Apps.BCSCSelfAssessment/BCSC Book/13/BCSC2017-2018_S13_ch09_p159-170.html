			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Introduction</p>
				<div id="Chapt9_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Presbyopia, the normal progressive loss of accommodation, affects all individuals beginning in middle age, regardless of any underlying refractive error. This relentless loss of near vision and dependency on glasses for near work may be particularly distressing for individuals with emmetropic vision who have previously enjoyed excellent uncorrected vision at all distances.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Interest in developing a surgical correction for presbyopia has resulted in several treatment options. Some of these techniques rely on scleral modification, some use implantation of presbyopia-&#173;correcting intraocular lenses (IOLs), and others depend on the creation of a multifocal cornea by use of lasers or corneal stromal modifications. More recently, the development of corneal inlays has introduced a new option for patients.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Theories of Accommodation</p>
				<div id="Chapt9_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">Helmholtz hypothesis</span> or <span class="italic">capsular theory</span> of accommodation states that during distance vision the ciliary muscle is relaxed and the zonular fibers that cross the circumlental space between the ciliary body and the lens equator are in a state of “resting” tension. With accommodative effort, an anterior movement of the ciliary muscle annular ring and a release of tension on the zonules occur, increasing the accommodative power of the lens. An anterior movement of the ciliary muscle annular ring also takes place during accommodation. The reduced zonular tension allows the elastic capsule of the lens to contract, causing a decrease in equatorial lens diameter and an increase in the curvature of the anterior and posterior lens surfaces. This “rounding up” of the lens yields a corresponding increase in its dioptric power, as is necessary for near vision (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-1</span>). When the accommodative effort ceases, the ciliary muscle relaxes and the zonular tension on the lens equator increases to its resting state. This increased tension on the lens equator causes a flattening of the lens, a decrease in the curvature of the anterior <br />and posterior lens surfaces, and a decrease in the dioptric power of the unaccommodated eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the Helmholtz theory, the equatorial edge of the lens moves away from the sclera during accommodation and toward the sclera when accommodation ends. In this theory, all zonular fibers are relaxed during accommodation and under tension when the accommodative effort ends. According to Helmholtz, presbyopia results from the loss of lens elasticity with age. When the zonules of an older lens are relaxed, the lens does not change its shape to the same degree as a younger lens does; therefore, presbyopia is an aging process that can be reversed only by changing the elasticity of the lens or its capsule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diametrically opposed to the Helmholtz hypothesis is the <span class="italic">Schachar theory</span> of accommodation. Schachar suggested that during accommodation ciliary muscle contraction leads to a selective increase in equatorial zonular tension—rather than to the uniform decrease (anterior, equatorial, and posterior) proposed by the Helmholtz theory—with a subsequent pulling of the equatorial lens outward toward the sclera (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-2</span>). Schachar postulated that accommodation occurs through the direct effect of zonular tension (as opposed to the passive effect proposed by Helmholtz), causing an increase in lens curvature. In this theory, the loss of accommodation with age is a result of the continued growth of the lens, leading to an increase in lens diameter and a decrease in the lens–ciliary body distance, which in turn cause a loss of zonular tension. Anything that increases resting zonular tension (eg, scleral expansion) should restore accommodation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Schachar proposed that the mechanism for functional lens shape change is equatorial stretching by the zonules, which would decrease the peripheral lens volume and increase the central volume, thereby causing central steepening of the anterior central lens capsule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-3</span>). During accommodation and ciliary muscle contraction, tension on the equatorial zonular fibers increases, whereas tension on the anterior and posterior zonules decreases. These actions would allow the lens to maintain a stable position at all times, even as it undergoes changes in shape. Schachar theorized that the anterior and posterior zonules serve as passive support structures for the lens but that the equatorial zonules are what actively determine the optical power of the lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Evidence from recent studies on human and nonhuman primates contests Schachar’s theories of accommodation and presbyopia. Investigations in human tissues and with scanning electron microscopy reveal no zonular insertions (equatorial or otherwise) at the iris root or anterior ciliary muscle. Various imaging techniques have consistently demonstrated that the diameter of the crystalline lens decreases with accommodation so that the equator moves away from the ciliary body. In vitro laser scanning imaging shows that the crystalline lens does not change focal length when increasing and decreasing radial stretching forces are applied. This evidence thus contradicts Schachar’s proposal that the lens remains pliable with age and that presbyopia is due solely to lens growth and crowding that prevents optimum ciliary muscle action.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Using model-&#173;based reasoning, Goldberg proposed another theory of accommodation with the help of a computer-&#173;animated 3-dimensional (3-D) model of the eye and the accommodative system. Goldberg’s <span class="italic">theory of reciprocal zonular action</span> describes 3&#160;components of the zonules and posits that a synchronized movement among the ciliary body, zonules, and anterior hyaloid complex leads to a shift in the posterior lenticular curvature and refractive power (Video&#160;9-1).</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Scleral Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several scleral surgical procedures have been evaluated for use in the reduction of presbyopia. They share the objective of attempting to increase zonular tension by weakening or altering the sclera over the ciliary body to allow for its passive expansion. Thornton first proposed weakening the sclera by creating 8 or more scleral incisions over the ciliary body (anterior ciliary sclerotomy, ACS). Results were mixed, and any positive effect appeared short-lived. A prospective study of ACS using a 4-incision technique was discontinued because of significant adverse events, including anterior segment ischemia. In 2001, the American Academy of Ophthalmology stated that ACS was ineffective and a potentially dangerous treatment for presbyopia. Another method involving the placement of scleral expansion bands is under study (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-4</span>). The LaserACE procedure (Ace Vision Group Inc., Silver Lake, OH) employs a laser to increase the plasticity of the sclera over the ciliary body in order to increase the efficiency of accommodation. This technique is under investigation.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Accommodating Intraocular Lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Accommodating IOLs attempt to restore a significant amount of true accommodation to patients with surgically induced pseudophakia. Accommodating IOLs were designed following the observation that some patients who received silicone-&#173;plate IOLs reported better near vision than that expected from their refractive result. Investigations revealed that, during ciliary muscle contraction, forward displacement of the IOL led to an increase in the IOL’s effective power and thus an improvement in near vision. However, some studies have questioned the amplitude of true accommodation that can be expected solely on the basis of anterior displacement of the IOL optic. Other factors, such as pupil size, with-the-rule astigmatism, and mild myopia, may also contribute to unaided near visual acuity and increased depth of focus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some IOLs that use this accommodative approach are modified silicone plate–haptic lenses (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-5</span>). These lenses may allow anterior movement of the lens during accommodation. Another possibility is that ciliary body contraction causes a steepening of the anterior optic surface, allowing for better near vision. Although the exact cause of the movement is unclear, it appears to be a combination of posterior chamber pressure on the back surface of the IOL and ciliary body pressure on the IOL that vaults the optic forward. The anterior displacement is postulated to result in an effective increase in optical power and near vision.</p>

			<div id="Chapt9_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Monovision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the United States, monovision is the technique used most frequently for the nonspectacle correction of presbyopia. In this approach, the refractive power of 1&#160;eye is adjusted to improve near vision. Monovision may be achieved with contact lenses, laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), surface ablation (penetrating keratoplasty [PKP]), conductive keratoplasty (CK), or even lens surgery. Historically, the term <span class="italic">monovision</span> typically referred to the use of a distance contact lens in 1&#160;eye and a near contact lens in the other. A power difference between the eyes of 1.25–2.50&#160;diopters&#160;(D) was targeted on the basis of near visual acuity demands. Many refractive surgeons target mild myopia (–0.50 to –1.50&#160;D) for the near-&#173;vision eye in the presbyopic and prepresbyopic population. The term <span class="italic">modified monovision,</span> or <span class="italic">mini-&#173;monovision,</span> is more appropriate for this lower level of myopia for the near-&#173;vision eye. Mini-&#173;monovision is associated with only a mild decrease in distance vision, retention of good stereopsis, and a significant increase in the intermediate zone of functional vision. The intermediate zone is where many visual functions used in daily life occur (eg, looking at a computer screen, store shelves, or a car dashboard). For many patients, this compromise is an attractive alternative to constantly reaching for reading glasses. Selected patients who want better near vision may prefer greater monovision correction (–1.50 to –2.50&#160;D) despite the accompanying decrease in distance vision and stereopsis. The clinician should counsel the patient that leaving 1&#160;eye undercorrected may lead to glare and halos when driving at night. This can be corrected by giving patients driving glasses.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Patient selection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Appropriate patient selection and education are fundamental to the overall success of monovision treatment. Although monovision can be demonstrated with trial lenses in the examination room, a contact lens trial period at home is often more useful. Patients whose vision is neither presbyopic nor approaching presbyopia are typically not good candidates for monovision, as they are usually seeking optimal bilateral distance visual acuity. However, patients in their mid- to late&#160;30s should be counseled about impending presbyopia and the option of monovision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The best candidates for monovision are patients with myopia who are older than 40&#160;years and who, because of their current refractive error, retain some useful uncorrected near vision. These patients have always experienced adequate near vision simply by removing their glasses and therefore understand the importance of near vision. Patients who do not have useful uncorrected near vision (ie, patients with myopia worse than –4.50&#160;D, high astigmatism, or hyperopia; or contact lens wearers) may be more accepting of the need for reading glasses after refractive surgery. For most patients, refractive surgeons routinely aim for mild myopia (–0.50 to –0.75&#160;D, occasionally up to –1.50&#160;D) in the nondominant eye. It is prudent to give the patient a trial with contact lenses to ascertain patient acceptance and the exact degree of near vision desired. Patients should understand that loss of accommodation is progressive and that, as a result, monovision may not be permanent and corrective glasses may eventually be required.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As discussed in Chapter&#160;7, CK is a nonablative, collagen-&#173;shrinking procedure approved for the correction of low levels of hyperopia (+0.75 to +3.25&#160;D). This procedure has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of presbyopia in individuals with hyperopic or emmetropic vision.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Multifocal Intraocular Lens Implants</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The number of IOL options for patients undergoing cataract surgery has increased in recent years. Patients may select a traditional monofocal IOL with a refractive target of emmetropia, mild myopia, or monovision, or they may opt for a multifocal or accommodating IOL for greater range of focus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several multifocal IOLs (MFIOLs) have been granted FDA approval in the United States. Since the first IOL was introduced, lens design has evolved to include <span class="italic">zonal refractive</span> and <span class="italic">apodized diffractive IOLs.</span> The zonal refractive lens design uses refractive power changes from the center of the lens to the periphery to provide distance and near correction. In contrast, diffractive lens designs employ a series of concentric rings to form a diffraction grating (see BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics</span>) to create 2&#160;separate focal points for distance and near vision (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-6</span>). Some diffractive lenses are apodized, meaning that the diffractive step heights are gradually tapered to yield a more even distribution of light, theoretically allowing for a smoother transition among images from distance to intermediate and near targets. Currently the only zonal refractive IOL available in the United States is the TECHNIS Symfony (Abbott Medical Optics Inc., Santa Ana, CA). A variety of styles are available in Europe. Examples of this type of lens include the M-<span class="italic">flex</span>&#160;T (Rayner, Hove, United Kingdom) and the LENTIS Mplus (Oculentis GmbH, Berlin, Germany) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-7</span>). IOLs with extended depth of focus (EDOF) and trifocal optics are also available in Europe; examples are the TECHNIS Symfony, FineVision (PhysIOL, Liège, Belgium), and the AT&#160;LISA tri (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany).</p>

			<p class="h3">Patient selection</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician should have a comprehensive discussion with each patient regarding the benefits and visual outcomes of MFIOLs to ensure that the patient has realistic expectations. The preoperative examination is equally crucial as it is critical to rule out any macular or other ocular diseases preoperatively, as MFIOLs are contraindicated in eyes with preexisting poor vision potential. In addition, any ocular abnormality that could increase systemic ocular aberrations (eg, corneal scarring, irregular astigmatism, dry eye) may significantly decrease image quality with these lenses. The clinician should carefully consider the possibility of patient dissatisfaction with the quality of vision after MFIOL implantation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with suboptimal results or who are dissatisfied with the quality of vision should undergo a comprehensive evaluation from the ocular surface to the macula. The clinician should exclude possible causes of vision disturbance, such as dry eye, residual refractive error, decentered lens or pupil, irregular astigmatism, vitreous opacities, cystoid macular edema, or epiretinal membrane. Postoperative capsular opacification is of greater concern with MFIOLs because minimal changes in the capsule can cause early deterioration in vision. To achieve optimal vision, Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy may be required earlier or more frequently in patients with MFIOLs than in patients with monofocal IOLs. However, if IOL exchange is being contemplated, Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy should be deferred. Other possible causes of vision disturbance should be excluded before an IOL exchange is considered. MFIOLs may cause glare and halos around lights at night, although newer MFIOLs incorporate technology that substantially reduces (but does not generally eliminate) these optical phenomena. Symptoms may be reduced through the use of nighttime driving glasses or instillation of topical brimonidine drops to reduce mesopic pupil size. In addition, most of these symptoms will decrease over time through neuroadaptation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Custom or Multifocal Ablations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An excimer laser may be used to create a multifocal cornea. Prompted by the observation that, following excimer ablation, the uncorrected near vision of many patients improved more than expected (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-8</span>), ophthalmologists began to investigate the potential for improving near vision without significantly compromising distance vision. To this end, the following ablation patterns have been employed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-12">a small, central steep zone ablation, in which the central portion of the cornea is used for near vision and the midperiphery is used for distance vision</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">an inferior near-zone ablation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">an inferiorly decentered hyperopic ablation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-13">a central distance ablation with an intermediate/near midperipheral ablation</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some of these patterns generate simultaneous near and distance images, whereas others rely on pupillary constriction (accommodative convergence) to concentrate light rays through the steeper central ablation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the excimer laser offers some potential advantages, the results of multifocal corneal ablations are still under investigation.</p>

			<p class="h2">Corneal Intrastromal Femtosecond Laser Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Femtosecond lasers may also be used to treat presbyopia. This minimally invasive approach is available in several countries outside the United States (but is not currently FDA approved) and does not involve incisions or flap creation. In this procedure, known as IntraCor, the femtosecond laser makes concentric rings within the stroma, starting in the center with a ring diameter of 1.8&#160;mm, and proceeding with subsequent rings toward the periphery. The formation of these rings produces a localized biomechanical change that reshapes the cornea to create multifocality. The procedure is typically performed only in the nondominant eye. Studies have demonstrated that this procedure can benefit patients with hyperopic presbyopia (+0.50&#160;D to +1.25&#160;D), as the treatment causes an increase in the corneal true net power as well as a potential gain of 4–5&#160;lines of near vision. It is important to counsel patients that uncorrected near vision is not significantly improved at 1&#160;month postoperatively but that it is improved by 6&#160;months in most cases.</p>

			<p class="h2">Corneal Inlays</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal inlays improve near vision by several different mechanisms: changing corneal curvature, increasing depth of field via a small central aperture, or changing the refractive index of the cornea (see Fig&#160;4-1B). The KAMRA corneal inlay (AcuFocus Inc, Irvine, CA) has been used successfully and is commercially availability in 49&#160;countries. It was FDA approved in 2015 and is the first inlay to be available in the United States. It is 5&#160;µm thick with a 3.8-mm outer diameter and a 1.6-mm central aperture. It “corrects” presbyopia via a pinhole effect, providing near vision in the nondominant eye in which it is implanted. Another inlay is the Flexivue Microlens (Presbia, Dublin, Ireland), a small, hydrophilic acrylic clear inlay with an index of refraction different from that of the cornea. A small hole in the center allows for distance vision and nutritional circulation. The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay (Revision Optics, Lake Forest, CA) is a hydrogel inlay 2&#160;mm in diameter and 32&#160;µm thick centrally. As a hydrogel, it allows nutrients and oxygen to pass through and, when placed centrally, causes central corneal steepening, resulting in variable power from center of the cornea to the periphery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All currently available inlays are implanted only in the nondominant eye, which should have a stable refractive spherical equivalent of –1.00 to 0.00&#160;D at the time of surgery. This value either can be the baseline refractive error or can be achieved with laser refractive surgery, such as LASIK, performed at least 1&#160;month prior to implantation of the inlay. The inlay is typically placed in a corneal pocket created by a femtosecond laser, allowing for better centration, lower risk of corneal striae, and minimal impact on the peripheral corneal nerve innervation. The inlay must be centered on the visual axis, as even a slightly decentered placement can significantly affect the visual outcome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Neuroadaptation to these inlays may take months. Because the procedure is performed only in the nondominant eye, some adverse visual effects (night halos) may be less perceptible in binocular viewing conditions. One of the benefits of corneal inlays is that they can be removed with few to no long-term sequelae. See Chapter&#160;4 for more details.</p>

			<p class="h1">Other Intraocular Lens Innovations on the Horizon</p>
				<div id="Chapt9_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition to single-&#173;plate accommodating IOLs, which are thought to work via lens effectivity secondary to a change in the position of the optic in the eye, lenses with dual-&#173;optic elements connected by a system of springlike struts have been developed and are under clinical investigation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-9</span>). During accommodation, the lens system confined within the capsular bag undergoes a change in the separation of the 2&#160;optics, resulting in increased effective lens power. The lens can be implanted into the eye through a 3.5-mm incision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another type of lens is made from a thermoplastic acrylic gel that can be customized to any size, shape, or power specified by the physician. The hydrophobic acrylic material is chemically bonded to wax, which melts inside the eye at body temperature and allows the predetermined shape and power of the material to emerge. Theoretically, compression of this pliable lens by the capsular bag allows adjustment of its effective power in a manner analogous to the way the crystalline lens adjusts. Examples of deformable IOLs in preliminary stages of development are the FlexOptic IOL (Abbott Medical Optics), FluidVision IOL (PowerVision, Belmont, CA), and NuLens accommodating IOL (NuLens Ltd, Herzliya Pituach, Israel). The NuLens changes its power rather than its position in the eye. It incorporates a small chamber of silicone gel and a posterior piston with an aperture.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, flexible polymers are being designed for injection into a nearly intact capsular bag following extraction of the crystalline lens through a tiny, laterally placed capsulorrhexis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Light Adjustable Lens (LAL) (Calhoun Vision, Pasadena, CA) is made from a macromer silicone matrix with smaller, embedded photosensitive molecules that allow for postoperative customization of the power via tunable ultraviolet light treatment (see Chapter&#160;8 for more details).</p>
