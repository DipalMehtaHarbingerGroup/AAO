			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Refractive errors, including presbyopia, may be treated by placing preformed tissue or synthetic material onto or into the cornea. This approach alters the optical power of the cornea by changing the shape of the anterior corneal surface or by creating a lens with a higher index of refraction than the corneal stroma that is then implanted within the cornea. Intracorneal inlays with small apertures that use the pinhole effect to increase depth of focus have been developed. Tissue addition procedures, such as epikeratoplasty, have fallen out of favor because of the poor predictability of the refractive and visual results, loss of best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA; also called <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity, CDVA</span>), and difficulty of obtaining donor tissue. Compared with donor tissue, synthetic material can be shaped more precisely, and it can be mass-&#173;produced. Because of problems with reepithelialization when synthetic material is placed on top of the cornea, synthetic material generally has to be placed within the corneal stroma. This placement requires a partial or complete lamellar dissection using specialized instruments. Early work using lenticules made of glass and plastic resulted in necrosis of the overlying stroma because glass and plastic are impermeable to water, oxygen, and nutrients. Current techniques use lenticule inlays made of more permeable substances such as hydrogel, with or without microperforations in the lenticule, to increase the transmission of nutrients. Another category of corneal inlays are corneal ring segments made of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Because the ring segments are narrow, the overlying stroma can receive nutrients from surrounding tissue.</p>
			<p class="h1">Keratophakia</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In keratophakia, a plus-&#173;powered lens is placed intrastromally to increase the curvature of the anterior cornea to correct hyperopia and presbyopia. After a central lamellar keratectomy is performed with a microkeratome or femtosecond laser, the flap is lifted, the lenticule is placed onto the host bed, and the flap is replaced and adheres without sutures. Lenticules can be prepared from either donor cornea or synthetic material; these types are referred to as homoplastic and alloplastic lenticules, respectively.</p>
			<p class="h2">Homoplastic Corneal Inlays</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A homoplastic inlay is created from a donor cornea by a lamellar keratectomy after removal of the epithelium and Bowman layer. The lenticule (fresh or frozen) is then shaped into a lens using an automated lathe. The lens can be preserved fresh in refrigerated tissue-&#173;culture medium, frozen at subzero temperatures, or freeze-dried.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Keratophakia has been used to correct aphakia and hyperopia of up to 20.00&#160;D, but few studies on this procedure have been published. Troutman and colleagues reported on 32&#160;eyes treated with homoplastic keratophakia, 29 of which also underwent cataract extraction. Even for procedures done by experienced surgeons, refractive predictability was still low: the eyes of 25% of patients were more than 3.00&#160;D from the intended correction. Complications included irregular lamellar resection, wound dehiscence, and postoperative corneal edema. Although the procedure was originally intended to be used in conjunction with cataract extraction for the correction of aphakia, the complexity of the procedure and the unpredictable refractive results could not compete—in the early 1980s—with aphakic contact lenses or the improved technology of intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Homoplastic keratophakia using tissue from stromal lenticule extraction has been suggested, however, for treating hyperopia, presbyopia, and ectatic corneal diseases.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Alloplastic Corneal Inlays</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Alloplastic inlays offer several potential advantages over homoplastic inlays, such as the ability to be accurately mass-&#173;produced in a wide range of sizes and powers. Synthetic material may have optical properties that are superior to those of tissue lenses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For insertion of the inlay, a laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)–type flap or a stromal pocket dissection can be performed; such procedures are technically easier than a complete lamellar keratectomy. Experiments performed in the early 1980s resulted in corneal opacities, nonhealing epithelial erosions, and diurnal fluctuation in vision because fluid and nutrients were blocked from reaching the anterior cornea. Thus, to allow for the transfer of fluid and nutrients to the anterior cornea, either permeable materials were used or microperforations were incorporated into the inlays. Because of work performed by Knowles and others, most subsequent studies used water-&#173;permeable hydrogel implants. Hydrogel lenses have an index of refraction similar to that of the corneal stroma, so these lenses have little intrinsic optical power when implanted. To be effective, hydrogel inlays must change the curvature of the anterior cornea. Other mechanisms of action include inlays with refractive power and small aperture inlays. Four different presbyopic inlays have been developed and are currently in investigational studies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the KAMRA corneal inlay (AcuFocus Inc, Irvine, CA). This small-&#173;aperture inlay is indicated for the improvement of near vision in presbyopic patients who require near correction. This device is an ultrathin (5-µm), biocompatible polymer that is microperforated to allow improved nutrient flow. The 3.8-mm-diameter inlay has a central aperture of 1.6&#160;mm and is generally implanted in the nondominant eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-1</span>). The surgeon places the inlay into an intrastromal pocket created by femtosecond laser, using a spot and line separation of 6&#160;<span class="CharOverride-1">×</span>&#160;6&#160;µm or less. The inlay should be placed at a depth equal to or greater than 200&#160;µm, centered on the patient-&#173;fixated, coaxially sighted corneal light reflex. Although the inlay has no refractive power, the central aperture functions as a pinhole to increase depth of focus and improve near vision without changing distance vision. (See Corneal Inlays in Chapter 9.)</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the FDA study, an average gain of 3&#160;lines of uncorrected near vision in the implanted eye was observed at 12&#160;months. With a 6&#160;<span class="CharOverride-1">×</span>&#160;6 spot and line separation in the FDA study, 95% of eyes achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of 20/40 or better uncorrected near acuity, and a primary safety endpoint of 0.0% eyes having greater than or equal to 2&#160;lines of persistent loss of BCVA. Rare but reported complications include refractive instability, decentration, and haze. In the FDA study with a 6&#160;<span class="CharOverride-1">×</span>&#160;6 spot and line separation, 2.9% of inlays were removed, and all eyes with removals returned to their preoperative BCVA.</p>

			<p class="h2">Epikeratoplasty</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epikeratoplasty involved suturing a preformed homoplastic lenticule directly onto the Bowman layer of the host cornea (see Fig&#160;4-1). Because no viable cells existed in the donor tissue, classic graft rejection did not occur. Epikeratoplasty was originally intended to create a “living contact lens” for patients with aphakia who were unable to wear contact lenses. Indications for this procedure were later expanded to include hyperopia, myopia, and keratoconus, but problems such as adherence of the grafted tissue, infection, epithelial ingrowth into the bed, poor predictability of results, and corneal edema have relegated epikeratoplasty to a historical footnote. In treating patients with these conditions, surgeons need to approach corneal refractive surgery with caution.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segments</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Background</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intrastromal corneal ring segments (ICRS) can treat low degrees of myopia by displacing the lamellar bundles and shortening the corneal arc length. However, the main indication for ICRS placement is keratoconus and other forms of ectatic corneal diseases. These circular arcs, made of PMMA, are placed in the posterior midperipheral corneal stroma in a lamellar channel (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;4-2, 4-3</span>). The thicker the segment is, the greater will be the flattening of the central cornea and the reduction in myopia. Ferrara rings (Ferrara Ophthalmics, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) or Kerarings (Mediphacos, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) have a smaller optical zone and a greater flattening effect than do Intacs (Oasis Medical, San Dimas, CA). This section focuses on Intacs because Ferrara-&#173;type rings, although commonly used internationally, are not FDA approved for use in the United States.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment using ring segments has several potential advantages over other forms of refractive surgery. The ring segments can be explanted, making the refractive result of the procedure potentially reversible, and they can be replaced with ring segments of a different thickness to titrate the refractive result. Intacs are FDA approved to treat myopia at levels ranging from –1.00 to –3.00&#160;D spherical equivalent; they are not approved for patients with astigmatism. However, Intacs surgery is no longer commonly performed for myopia because the results are not as predictable as are those with ablative corneal surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intacs are typically contraindicated in</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5">patients with collagen vascular, autoimmune, or immunodeficiency diseases</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">pregnant or breastfeeding women</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-6">patients who may be predisposed to future complications because of the presence of ocular conditions (such as herpetic keratitis, recurrent corneal erosion syndrome, and corneal dystrophy)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Instrumentation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Initially, a 1-piece 360° Intacs ring was used in the procedure, but it proved difficult to insert. The design was later changed to 2&#160;segments of 150° arc each. The segments have a fixed inner diameter of 6.80&#160;mm and an outer diameter of 8.10&#160;mm, and they are available in various thicknesses: 0.210, 0.250, 0.275, 0.300, 0.325, 0.350, 0.400, and 0.450&#160;mm. The degree of correction achieved is related to the thickness of the ring segments; thicker ring segments are used for greater correction. Manually operated surgical equipment or a femtosecond laser can be used to create the channels.</p>
			<p class="h2">Technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The procedure involves creating a lamellar channel at approximately 68%–70% stromal depth, followed by insertion of the ring segments. The geometric center of the cornea is marked with a blunt hook. An ultrasound pachymeter is used to measure the thickness of the cornea over the entry mark. A diamond knife is set to 68%–70% of the stromal depth and then used to create a 1.0-mm radial incision. Specially designed mechanical instruments are then used to create the channels for the segments by blunt separation of the collagen lamellae (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-4</span>). Similar entry incisions and channels may be created using a femtosecond laser (Video&#160;4-1). The channels are created in an arc pattern at the desired inner and outer diameters. Once the channels are created, specialized forceps are used to insert the first ring segment and rotate it into position, followed by similar insertion and rotation of the second segment. Tissue glue or 1 or 2 10-0 nylon sutures may be used to close the radial incision at the corneal surface.</p>

			<p class="h2">Outcomes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Food and Drug Administration clinical trials provided the most complete outcome analysis of Intacs for myopia. A total of 452&#160;patients enrolled in these trials. Patients received 0.25-, 0.30-, or 0.35-mm ring segments to correct an average preoperative mean spherical equivalent of –2.240&#160;D (range, –0.750 to –4.125&#160;D). At 12&#160;months postoperatively, 97% of treated eyes had 20/40 or better uncorrected vision and 74% had achieved 20/20 or better. In addition, 69% and 92% of eyes were within ±0.50 and 1.00&#160;D of emmetropia, respectively. These clinical outcomes were similar to early results with photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and LASIK, although excimer laser studies generally treated a broader range of preoperative myopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Additional FDA approval was later granted to include intermediate segment sizes of 0.275 and 0.325&#160;mm. Internationally, CE (Conformité Européene) marking status (similar in concept to US FDA approval) was extended to thicker segment sizes. In 2000, Colin found that Intacs implantation compared favorably with PRK for treating low myopia, although it induced greater astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The removal or exchange rate varies between 3% and 15%. A common reason for a ring segment exchange is residual myopia. Ring segment removal is most often performed because of disabling vision symptoms such as glare, double vision, and photophobia. Few complications are associated with ring segment removal. In a series of 684&#160;eyes that received Intacs, 46 (6.7%) underwent their removal. Most patients returned to their original preoperative myopia by 3&#160;months postremoval (73% returned to within 0.50&#160;D of preoperative mean spherical equivalent). No patient had a loss of BCVA of more than 2&#160;lines. However, up to 15% of patients reported new or worsening symptoms after removal.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Intracorneal Ring Segments and Keratoconus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the past, very few surgical options other than penetrating and lamellar keratoplasty were available for the treatment of keratoconus. Excimer laser procedures, which correct ametropia by removing tissue, are generally not recommended for treating keratoconus because of the risk of exacerbating corneal structural weakening and ectasia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In 2004, Intacs received a <span class="italic">Humanitarian Device Exemption</span> from the FDA for use in reducing or eliminating myopia and astigmatism in certain patients with keratoconus, specifically those who can no longer achieve adequate vision with their contact lenses or glasses (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-5</span>). The intent was to restore functional vision and defer the need for a corneal transplant. Labeled selection criteria for patients include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">progressive deterioration in vision such that the patient can no longer achieve adequate functional vision on a daily basis with contact lenses or glasses</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">age 21&#160;years or older</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">clear central corneas</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">a corneal thickness of 450&#160;µm or greater at the proposed incision site</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">a lack of options other than corneal transplantation for improving functional vision</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although these are FDA labeling parameters, many surgeons perform Intacs insertion outside these criteria. In one study of 26&#160;keratoconus patients, the ring segments were oriented horizontally, with a thick ring (0.450&#160;mm) placed in the inferior cornea and a thinner one (0.250&#160;mm) in the superior cornea. In another study of 50&#160;patients (74&#160;eyes), the orientation of the ring segments was adjusted according to the refractive cylinder. On the basis of the level of myopia, either the 0.300-mm ring or the 0.350-mm ring (the largest available in the United States at that time) was placed inferiorly, and the 0.250-mm ring was placed superiorly. Patients had mild to severe keratoconus with or without scarring. A superficial channel with perforation of the Bowman layer in 1&#160;eye was the only operative complication. A total of 6&#160;rings were explanted for segment migration and externalization (1&#160;ring) and foreign-&#173;body sensation (5&#160;rings).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The improvement in vision was significant. With an average follow-&#173;up period of 9&#160;months, the mean uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA); also called <span class="italic">uncorrected distance visual acuity, UDVA</span>) improved from approximately 20/200 (1.05 logMAR [base-10 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution]) to 20/80 (0.61 logMAR) (<span class="italic">P</span> &lt;.01). The mean BCVA also improved, from approximately 20/50 (0.41 logMAR) to 20/32 (0.24 logMAR) (<span class="italic">P</span> &lt;.01). Most patients still required optical correction to achieve their best-&#173;corrected vision. Eyes with corneal scarring had a similar improvement in UCVA and BCVA. Inferior steepening was reduced on topography as was coma. The dioptric power of the inferior cornea relative to the superior (I–S value) was reduced from a preoperative mean of 25.62 to 6.60 postoperatively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A study evaluating the long-term stability of Intacs in keratoconus found that in nearly 93% of patients with documented progression of keratoconus pre-&#173;Intacs, there was no further progression of keratoconus between 1 and 5&#160;years after Intacs implantation. In addition, no statistically significant differences were noted in mean steep, flat, and average keratometry readings; manifest refraction spherical equivalent; and UCVA and BCVA (<span class="italic">P</span> &gt;.05) between 1 and 5&#160;years postimplantation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Number of Segments</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although most surgeons implant 2&#160;Intacs segments, the use of only 1&#160;segment may be indicated. If the steep area is peripheral (similar to pellucid marginal degeneration), it may be preferable to place 1&#160;segment instead of 2&#160;segments because the keratoconic cornea has 2&#160;optical areas of distortion within the pupil: a steep lower area and a flat upper area. For peripheral keratoconus, it is better to flatten the steep area and steepen the flat area than to flatten the entire cornea. Single-&#173;segment placement can achieve that result (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-6</span>). When a single segment is placed, it flattens the adjacent cornea but causes steepening of the cornea 180° away—the “beanbag effect” (ie, when one sits on a beanbag, it flattens in one area and pops up in another area). This effect may yield a more physiologic improvement than would the global flattening effect from the use of double segments. Intacs treatment can also be combined with corneal crosslinking for improved corneal strength and phakic IOL implantation to improve refractive error (see Chapter&#160;7).</p>

			<p class="h2">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The loss of BCVA (≥2&#160;lines of vision) after intracorneal ring segment insertion has been found to be approximately 1% at 1&#160;year postoperatively.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fine white deposits occur frequently within the lamellar ring channels after Intacs placement (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;4-9</span>). The incidence and density of the deposits increase with the thickness of the ring segment and the duration of implantation. Deposits do not seem to alter the optical performance of the ring segments or to cause corneal thinning or necrosis, although some patients are bothered by their appearance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intacs achieve the best results in eyes with mild to moderate keratoconus. The goals are generally to improve vision and reduce distortions and are determined on the basis of the degree of keratoconus. For example, a patient with mild keratoconus and a BCVA of 20/30 may have the goal of improved quality of vision in glasses or soft contact lenses. However, a contact lens–intolerant patient with more advanced keratoconus and a BCVA of 20/60 may have the goal of improved ability to wear a rigid gas-&#173;permeable (RGP) contact lens. For some advanced cases of keratoconus, such as eyes with keratometry values greater than 60.00&#160;D, the likelihood of functional improvement of vision is lower than for eyes with flatter keratometry values. In such cases, despite the use of Intacs, a corneal transplant may be unavoidable. If required, penetrating or lamellar keratoplasty may be performed after Intacs placement.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ectasia After LASIK</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ring segments have also been used for the postoperative management of corneal ectasia after LASIK. As in the treatment of keratoconus, few surgical options are available to treat corneal ectasia. Use of an excimer laser to remove additional tissue is generally considered contraindicated. A lamellar graft or penetrating keratoplasty may result in significant morbidity, such as irregular astigmatism, delayed recovery of vision, and tissue rejection. In limited early trials that used Intacs to treat post-&#173;LASIK ectasia, myopia was reduced and UCVA was improved. However, the long-term effect of such an approach for managing post-&#173;LASIK ectasia is still being evaluated. Use of Intacs for post-&#173;LASIK ectasia is an off-&#173;label treatment, and care should be taken with implantation in the presence of a lamellar interface.</p>

			<p class="h2">Other Considerations With Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segments and LASIK</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal ring segments have been used to correct residual myopia following LASIK with good initial results. In such cases, a nomogram adjustment is necessary to reduce the risk of overcorrection. This procedure may be useful in patients whose stromal bed is not sufficient to support a second excimer laser ablation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Conversely, after ring segments have been removed from patients whose vision did not improve satisfactorily (eg, due to undercorrection or induced astigmatism), LASIK has been performed with good success. The flap is created in a plane superficial to the previous ring segment channel.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Orthokeratology</p>
			<div id="Chapt4_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Orthokeratology, or corneal refractive therapy, refers to the overnight use of RGP contact lenses to temporarily reduce myopia. The goal of this nonsurgical method of temporary myopia reduction is to achieve functional UCVA during the day. The contact lens is fitted at a base curve that is flatter than the corneal curvature. Temporary corneal flattening results from the flattening of corneal epithelium. Use of the lens is intended for the temporary reduction of naturally occurring myopia between –0.50 and –6.00&#160;D of sphere, with up to 1.75&#160;D of astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Orthokeratology is most appropriate for highly motivated patients with low myopia who do not want refractive surgery but who want to avoid use of contact lenses and glasses during the day. These contact lenses do not treat astigmatism or hyperopia. Prospective patients should be informed that in clinical trials, approximately one-third of patients discontinued contact lens use, and most patients (75%) experienced discomfort at some point during contact lens wear. Complications of orthokeratology include induced astigmatism, induced higher-&#173;order aberrations, recurrent erosions, and infectious keratitis. Infectious keratitis—the most serious complication—can be bilateral and seems to be more common in children and teenagers. Pathogens implicated include <span class="italic">Pseudomonas, Acanthamoeba, Staphylococcus,</span> and <span class="italic">Nocardia</span> species.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The prevalence and incidence of complications associated with orthokeratology, such as bacterial and parasitic keratitis, have not been determined. Sufficiently large, well-&#173;designed, controlled studies are needed to provide a more reliable measure of the risks of treatment and to identify risk factors for complications.
