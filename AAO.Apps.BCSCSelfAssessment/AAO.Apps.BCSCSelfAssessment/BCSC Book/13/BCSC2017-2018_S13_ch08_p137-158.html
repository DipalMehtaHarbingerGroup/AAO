			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In its early history, <span class="italic">refractive surgery</span> was synonymous with <span class="italic">corneal refractive (keratorefractive)</span> surgery. In recent years, the scope of refractive surgery has expanded to include lens-based intraocular surgical techniques for achieving refractive outcomes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In crystalline lens–&#173;sparing procedures, termed <span class="italic">phakic intraocular lens implantation,</span> the implantation of a phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) allows treatment of more extreme refractive errors, especially high myopia. Available PIOLs in the United States include iris-&#173;fixated and posterior chamber (sulcus) lenses for myopia. Outside the United States, angle-&#173;supported, iris-&#173;fixated, and posterior chamber lenses are available for hyperopia and myopia, and some phakic toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) are available to correct both myopic and hyperopic and astigmatism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In crystalline lens–&#173;extraction procedures, termed <span class="italic">refractive lens exchange (RLE),</span> the patient’s lens is removed and replaced with a prosthetic lens to address refractive errors of the eye. Advances in cataract surgical technique (small, predictable wounds, precision biometry, and improved IOL power calculation formulas) and expanded choices of intraocular lenses have afforded more accurate and predictable refractive outcomes allowing the elective correction of spherical, astigmatic, and presbyopic refractive errors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The combination of corneal and intraocular refractive surgery, termed <span class="italic">bioptics,</span> allows patients at the extremes of refractive error, both spherical (myopia, hyperopia) and cylindrical (astigmatism), to attain good, predictable outcomes by combining the advantages of the intraocular refractive surgery in treating large corrections with the adjustability of keratorefractive techniques. In addition, the optical quality may be improved by dividing the refractive correction between the 2&#160;surgical procedures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This chapter discusses the intraocular surgical techniques that are now, or are soon expected to be, available to the refractive surgeon.</p>

			<div id="Chapt8_Top1">
			<p class="h2-h1">Background</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The history of the PIOL in correcting refractive error began in Europe in the 1950s, but manufacturing-&#173;quality limitations precluded these IOLs from achieving widespread use until the 1990s. Refinements in IOL design have reduced the incidence of complications and, consequently, increased the popularity of these PIOLs both inside and outside the United States. Within the United States, 3&#160;PIOLs are currently approved by the US&#160;Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for myopia: 2&#160;nonfoldable polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) iris-&#173;fixated PIOLs, and 1&#160;foldable collamer posterior chamber PIOL. The 2&#160;nonfoldable PMMA lenses are identical in design but have different dioptric ranges. Outside the United States, available models include foldable versions of the PMMA PIOLs, hyperopic and toric versions of all of these PIOLs, and an angle-&#173;fixated PIOL. Representative lenses in each category (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;8-1</span>) are discussed in the following sections.</p>
			<p class="reference-single--no-space- ParaOverride-2">Huang D, Schallhorn SC, Sugar A, et al. Phakic intraocular lens implantation for the correction of myopia: a report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology. <span class="italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2009;116(11):2244–2258.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Advantages</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phakic intraocular lenses have the advantage of treating a much larger range of refractive errors than can be treated safely and effectively with corneal refractive surgery. The skills required for insertion are, with a few exceptions, similar to those used in cataract surgery. The equipment needed for IOL implantation is substantially less expensive than an excimer laser and is similar to that used for cataract surgery. In addition, the PIOL is removable; therefore, the refractive effect should theoretically be reversible. However, any intervening change caused by the PIOL implantation is often permanent. Compared with refractive lens exchange (discussed later in this chapter), PIOL implantation has the advantage of preserving natural accommodation; it also has a lower risk of endophthalmitis and postoperative retinal detachment because the crystalline lens barrier is preserved and there is minimal vitreous destabilization.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Disadvantages</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phakic intraocular lens insertion is an intraocular procedure, with all the potential risks associated with intraocular surgery. In addition, each PIOL style has its own set of associated risks. Lenses currently available in the United States with PMMA optics are not foldable, so their insertion requires a relatively large wound, which may result in postoperative astigmatism. Posterior chamber PIOLs have a higher incidence of cataract formation. For patients with PIOLs in whom a visually significant cataract eventually develops, the PIOL will have to be explanted at the time of cataract surgery, possibly through a larger-than-&#173;usual wound. Although PIOLs to correct hyperopia are available outside the United States, indications for their implantation are narrower because the anterior chamber tends to be shallower than in patients with myopia, causing the IOL to sit too close to the corneal endothelium and resulting in increased endothelial cell loss.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Patient Selection</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phakic intraocular lenses can be offered as the primary surgical option for anyone who has refractive errors within the available treatment range and meets other screening criteria (discussed later). However, most surgeons reserve PIOL use for patients whose refractive limits are near or beyond the FDA-&#173;approved limits for laser vision correction, or who are otherwise not good candidates for keratorefractive surgery. Although excimer lasers can be used to treat high degrees of myopia, many surgeons have reduced the upper limits for laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and surface ablation in their refractive practices because of the decreased predictability, high rate of regression, large amount of stromal tissue removed, increased incidence of microstriae, and night-&#173;vision problems that can occur with treatment of a patient with high myopia. Similarly, LASIK and surface ablation for correction of hyperopia greater than +4.00&#160;D and astigmatism greater than 4.00&#160;D of cylinder are less accurate than they are for lower corrections. If surgeons become comfortable with the use of PIOLs, they may also choose to implant them for refractive powers significantly lower than the maximal limits for programmable excimer laser treatments. In addition, due to the rapid visual recovery and low complication rate of currently available PIOLs, increasing numbers of surgeons are implanting these lenses bilaterally on the same day, providing a patient experience similar to bilateral same-day LASIK. The Ophthalmic Mutual Insurance Company (OMIC) has evaluated this practice.</p>
			<p class="body-text">PIOLs are available in powers between –3.00&#160;D and –20.00&#160;D in the United States (see Table&#160;8-1). Outside the United States, PIOLs are available for correcting hyperopia up to +10.00&#160;D. PIOLs may be considered off-&#173;label treatment for eyes with irregular topographies from forme fruste or frank keratoconus.</p>

Accessed November&#160;6, 2016.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Contraindications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phakic intraocular lenses have specific contraindications. These include preexisting intraocular disease such as a compromised corneal endothelium, iritis, significant iris abnormality, rubeosis iridis, cataract, or glaucoma. The anterior chamber diameter, anterior chamber depth, and pupil size must be appropriate for the specific PIOL being considered.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Patient evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A thorough preoperative evaluation is necessary, as detailed in Chapter&#160;2. PIOLs are not approved in the United States for patients younger than 21&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Informed consent</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As with any refractive procedure, an informed consent specifically for this procedure should be obtained before surgery. The patient should be informed of the potential short-term and long-term risks of the procedure and of available alternatives; he or she should also be counseled about the importance of long-term follow-&#173;up because of the potential for endothelial cell loss over time. The surgeon must also ensure that the patient has realistic expectations about the visual outcomes of the procedure.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Ancillary tests</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Specular microscopy or confocal microscopy should be performed to evaluate endothelial cell count and morphology. Anterior chamber depth must also be assessed because adequate depth is required for safe implantation of a PIOL. If the anterior chamber depth is less than 3.2&#160;mm, the risk of endothelial and iris or angle trauma from placement of an anterior chamber, iris-&#173;fixated, or posterior chamber PIOL is increased. Anterior chamber depth can be measured by ultrasound biomicroscopy, anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT), partial coherence interferometry, slit-beam topography, or Scheimpflug imaging. In the United States, PIOL implantation is contraindicated in individuals who do not meet the minimum endothelial cell count specified for each PIOL and who do not have a minimum anterior chamber depth of 3.2&#160;mm. Methods for IOL power selection are specific to each PIOL and manufacturer, and some manufacturers provide software for use in IOL power calculation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Surgical Technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topical anesthesia with an intracameral supplement is appropriate if the patient is able to cooperate and the PIOL can be inserted through a small incision. If the patient cannot cooperate for the use of topical anesthesia or if a large incision is required, peribulbar or general anesthesia is preferable. Retrobulbar anesthesia should be used with caution in patients whose eyes have a high axial length because of the increased risk of globe perforation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A peripheral iridotomy is recommended for all currently FDA-&#173;approved PIOLs to reduce the risk of pupillary block and angle closure; however, this recommendation may soon change, and iridotomy is not required for angle-&#173;supported PIOLs. One or more laser iridotomies can be performed before the PIOL surgery, or an iridectomy can be performed as part of the implant procedure. Viscoelastic material should be meticulously removed at the conclusion of surgery to prevent postoperative elevation of IOP.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Iris-fixated phakic intraocular lens</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most surgeons induce pupillary miosis before they initiate iris-&#173;fixated PIOL implantation, both to protect the crystalline lens and to make the iris easier to manipulate. The lens is generally inserted through a superior limbal incision but can be implanted with the wound placed at the steep meridian to minimize postoperative astigmatism. The long axis of the PIOL is ultimately oriented perpendicular to the axis of the incision. A side port incision is made approximately 2–3&#160;clock-hours on either side of the center of the incision; thus, a 12&#160;o’clock incision requires side port incisions near the 10 and 2&#160;o’clock meridians. The “claw” haptics are fixated to the iris in a process called <span class="italic">enclavation.</span> After the PIOL has been carefully centered over the pupil, it is stabilized with forceps while a specially designed enclavation needle is introduced through one of the side port incisions, and a small amount of iris is brought up into the claw haptic. This procedure is repeated on the other side. If adjustment of the PIOL position becomes necessary after fixation, the iris must be released before the PIOL is moved. Careful wound closure helps minimize surgically induced astigmatism. PMMA PIOLs require a 6-mm wound and thus generally require sutures for proper closure, whereas iris-&#173;fixated PIOLs made of flexible materials can be inserted through a small, self-&#173;sealing wound of approximately 3&#160;mm. Video&#160;8-1 demonstrates implantation of an iris-&#173;fixated IOL.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-2"><span class="h4-head">Sizing the iris-fixated phakic intraocular lens</span> Because this PIOL is fixated to the midperipheral iris, not the angle or sulcus, it has the advantage of having a “one-size-fits-all” length. It is 8.5&#160;mm in length, with a 5.0- or 6.0-mm PMMA optic (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Posterior chamber PIOLs require pupillary dilation prior to implantation. These PIOLs are made of a flexible collamer material and are implanted through a small wound approximately 3&#160;mm in length (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-2</span>). The optic of the PIOL is vaulted to avoid contact with the crystalline lens and to allow aqueous to flow over the crystalline lens. This vaulting can be viewed at the slit lamp as well as with ultrasound biomicroscopy or Scheimpflug imaging (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-3</span>). The lens manufacturers suggest that an acceptable amount of vaulting of the lens optic over the crystalline lens is 1.0 ± 0.5 corneal thicknesses. Using the appropriate vault is crucial for reducing complications (discussed later in the chapter).</p>
			<p class="body-text">For lens implantation, following pupil dilation, a 3.0- to 3.2-mm temporal clear corneal incision is made, and 1–2&#160;additional paracentesis incisions are created, usually superiorly and inferiorly, to facilitate lens positioning. The lens is inserted using a cohesive viscoelastic material; after the lens unfolds, the footplates are positioned under the iris (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-4</span>). The leading footplate is marked for identification and must be confirmed to be in the correct location once the lens exits the injector in order to ensure the lens is oriented with the correct side facing anteriorly. The surgeon should avoid contact with the central 6.0&#160;mm of the lens, as any contact might damage the thin lens optic. Care should be taken to avoid touching the crystalline lens with the PIOL to minimize the risk of cataract formation. Positioning instruments should be inserted through the paracenteses and should be kept peripheral to this central area. The pupil is then constricted. It is crucial to remove all viscoelastic material at the conclusion of the procedure to reduce the risk of a postoperative spike in intraocular pressure (IOP). Video&#160;8-2 demonstrates implantation of a posterior chamber PIOL.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Sizing the posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens</span> The correct IOL length is selected by using the white-to-white measurement between the 3 and 9&#160;o’clock meridians or by direct sulcus measurements made by a variety of techniques, including high-&#173;frequency ultrasound, anterior segment OCT, slit-beam or Scheimpflug imaging, and laser interferometry. Although the FDA-&#173;approved technique for measurement remains white-to-white measurement, there is growing evidence that direct sulcus measurement using any of these methods is superior and minimizes the risk of incorrect PIOL sizing. For more information on PIOLs, please refer to the FDA website.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">No angle-&#173;supported PIOLs are currently approved by the FDA. Outside the United States, several commercial angle-&#173;supported PIOLs are available. The most widely used lens is made of flexible acrylic material and can be inserted through a small incision without the need for pupil dilation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Outcomes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With better methods for determining PIOL power, outcomes have steadily improved. The significant postoperative gains in lines of best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA), also referred to as <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA),</span> over preoperative values are likely the result of a reduction in the image minification present with spectacle correction of high myopia. Loss of BCVA is rare. Moreover, the loss of contrast sensitivity noted after LASIK for high myopia does not occur after PIOL surgery. In fact, in all spatial frequencies, contrast sensitivity increases from preoperative levels with best spectacle correction.</p>

			<p class="h2">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Phakic intraocular lens surgery shares the same possible risks and complications as other forms of IOL surgery. However, the most relevant potential complications include raised IOP, persistent anterior chamber inflammation, traumatic PIOL dislocation, cataract formation, and endothelial cell loss. Some of these complications do not manifest for years, thus necessitating long-term follow-&#173;up.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Iris-fixated phakic intraocular lens</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">At 1-year follow-&#173;up in an FDA clinical trial of 662&#160;patients who had an iris-&#173;fixated PIOL implanted for myopia, 1&#160;patient had a hyphema, 5 had IOL dislocations, and 3 had iritis. Night-&#173;vision concerns about glare, starbursts, and halos were reported in 13.5%, 11.8%, and 18.2%, respectively, in patients who did not have these symptoms preoperatively. However, improvement in symptoms occurred 12.9%, 9.7%, and 9.8%, in patients after PIOL implantation. In general, nighttime symptoms were worse in patients with larger pupil diameters.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Stulting and colleagues reported a 3-year follow-&#173;up study on 232&#160;eyes of the 662&#160;eyes enrolled in the FDA study. A total of 5&#160;lenses dislocated and required reattachment, and an additional 20&#160;lenses required surgery for insufficient lens fixation. No eyes required IOP-&#173;lowering medications after the first month. The mean decrease in endothelial cell density from baseline to 3&#160;years was 4.8%. Six eyes required retinal detachment repair (rate, 0.3% per year), and 3&#160;eyes underwent cataract surgery.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition to the potential risks associated with implantation of other types of PIOLs, implantation of posterior chamber PIOLs increases the risk of cataract formation and pigmentary dispersion. If the posterior chamber PIOL is too large, vaulting increases, and iris chafing with pigmentary dispersion could result. If the PIOL is too small, the vaulting is reduced, decreasing the chance of chafing but increasing the risk of cataract. Incorrect PIOL vault can necessitate exchange of the implanted lens for one with a better fit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In an FDA clinical trial for 1&#160;posterior chamber PIOL model, the incidence of nighttime visual symptoms was approximately 10%, but a similar percentage showed improvement in these symptoms after surgery. The incidence of visually significant cataract development in the FDA clinical trial as reported by Sanders and colleagues was 0.4% for anterior subcapsular cataracts and 1% for nuclear sclerotic cataracts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Kamiya and colleagues reported 4-year follow-&#173;up results on 56&#160;eyes of 34&#160;patients with implanted posterior chamber PIOLs. No eyes developed pupillary block or a significant increase in IOP. The mean central endothelial cell loss was 3.7%. Symptomatic cataracts requiring surgery developed in 2 eyes, and asymptomatic anterior subcapsular cataracts developed in 6 other eyes. In a study of more than 500&#160;eyes monitored for an average of 4.7&#160;years, Sanders reported that anterior subcapsular opacities developed in 6%–7% of eyes, and visually significant cataracts developed in 1%–2% of eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The incidence of retinal detachment after posterior chamber PIOL insertion is very low. In a series of 418&#160;eyes that underwent a posterior chamber PIOL procedure, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment developed in 3 eyes (0.7%) at a mean of 19.8&#160;months postoperatively, a rate comparable to the expected natural history of detachment in eyes with similar degrees of myopia.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The complications reported most frequently for angle-&#173;supported PIOLs are nighttime glare and halos, pupil ovalization, and endothelial cell loss. The risk of pupillary block is low with the use of modern PIOL designs and of iridotomies when needed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Glare and halos, the most commonly reported symptoms after angle-&#173;supported PIOL insertion, occurred in 18.8%–20.0% of patients, but these symptoms appear to decrease by as much as 50% over a postoperative period of 7&#160;years. Endothelial cell loss occurring 1–7&#160;years after angle-&#173;supported PIOL insertion ranges from 4.6% to 8.4%. Pupil ovalization can occur because of iris tuck during insertion, or it can occur over time as a result of chronic inflammation and fibrosis around the haptics within the anterior chamber angle. The incidence of pupil ovalization ranges from 5.9% to 27.5% and is directly related to the postoperative interval studied. Ovalization is more likely when the implant is too large. In contrast, endothelial damage and decentration are most often associated with movement of a lens that is too small.</p>

The annualized percentage loss in central and peripheral endothelial cell density from 6&#160;months to 3&#160;years was 0.41% and 1.11%, respectively.</p>

            <p class="h1 ParaOverride-11">Refractive Lens Exchange</p>
        <div id="Chapt8_Top2">
            <p class="h2-h1">Advantages</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Refractive lens exchange has the advantage of greatly expanding the range of refractive surgery beyond what can be achieved with other available methods. The procedure retains the normal contour of the cornea, which may enhance the quality of vision, and it may be used to treat presbyopia as well as refractive error with incorporation of multifocal and/or accommodating IOLs.</p>
            <p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Disadvantages</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Quality of vision may not be as good with current multifocal IOLs (MFIOLs) as with other forms of vision correction. Patient expectations for excellent uncorrected visual acuity may be higher for RLE than for cataract surgery, underscoring the need for thorough preoperative discussion, close attention to detail preoperatively and intraoperatively, and postoperative treatment of residual refractive error.</p>
            <p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Patient Selection</p>
            <p class="h3-h2">Indications</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Refractive lens exchange (RLE) is the removal of the crystalline lens with IOL implantation for the primary purpose of correcting refractive error. RLE may be considered for the correction of myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia when alternative refractive procedures are not adequate to address the patient’s refractive error. RLE is typically used for refractive correction of presbyopic patients and in patients with lens opacity expected to progress quickly. RLE is generally not considered medically necessary and is usually not covered by the patient’s insurance. All FDA-&#173;approved IOLs are approved specifically for implantation at the time of cataract surgery, and implantation for RLE is considered an off-label use in the United States.</p>
            <p class="h3">Informed consent</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Refractive lens exchange carries risks and complications identical to those for routine cataract extraction with IOL implantation. Potential candidates must be capable of understanding the short-term and long-term risks of the procedure. Patients should be informed that unless they are targeted for residual myopia with monofocal, toric, or accommodating IOLs, or have an MFIOL implanted, they will not have functional near vision without correction. A consent form should be given to the patient prior to surgery to allow ample time for review and signature. A sample consent form for RLE for the correction of hyperopia and myopia is available from the Ophthalmic Mutual Insurance Company (OMIC) at www.omic.com.</p>
            <p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Myopia</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Refractive lens exchange can be considered in patients with myopia of any level, although it is most commonly used in presbyopic patients with higher myopia, for whom corneal refractive procedures or PIOL implantation are not indicated. Myopia, however, is a significant risk factor for retinal detachment in the absence of lens surgery, and this risk rises with increased axial length. High myopia, defined as an axial length of 26&#160;mm, or greater, is an independent risk factor for subsequent retinal detachment after lens extraction. Thus, a thorough retinal examination, including peripheral retinal evaluation, is indicated in these eyes prior to consideration of RLE.</p>

            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">If the amount of hyperopia is beyond the range of alternative refractive procedures, RLE might be the only available surgical option. As with correction for myopia, the patient must be informed about the risks of intraocular surgery. A patient with a shallow anterior chamber from a thickened crystalline lens or small anterior segment would not be a candidate for a PIOL and could benefit from the reduced risk of angle-&#173;closure glaucoma after RLE. In a highly hyperopic eye with an axial length less than 18&#160;mm, nanophthalmos should be considered. Eyes with these characteristics have a higher risk of uveal effusion syndrome and postoperative choroidal detachment. (See BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract,</span> for discussion of cataract surgery for a patient with high hyperopia and nanophthalmos.) Patients with hyperopia have a lower risk of retinal detachment than do patients with myopia.</p>

            <p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Astigmatism</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">With the advent of toric IOLs that cover an expanded range, patients with significant astigmatism are also candidates for RLE. In the United States, there are currently no FDA-&#173;approved toric MFIOLs, although a toric accommodating IOL has been approved. Thus, US patients planning to undergo implantation of a nonaccommodating toric IOL must understand the lack of uncorrected near acuity if targeted for distance; patients considering MFIOL implantation should understand that these IOLs will not sufficiently reduce astigmatism. Also, patients need to understand that an additional surgical procedure, usually LASIK, limbal relaxing incisions, or photorefractive keratectomy, may be necessary to maximize spectacle independence. Laser vision correction candidacy should be determined prior to lens-based surgery if it is being considered.</p>
            <p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Presbyopia</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Discussion of correction of presbyopia, in addition to correction of myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism, should be a component of the preoperative discussion in applicable patients. RLE is occasionally used primarily for the purpose of correcting presbyopia, with the implantation of multifocal or accommodating IOLs or the creation of monovision with lens implants. A patient selecting distance-&#173;focused toric or spherical IOLs in both eyes should be informed that reading glasses will be required for functional near vision.</p>
            <p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Surgical Planning and Technique</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although RLE is similar to cataract surgery, there are some additional considerations for planning and performing the procedure, as the primary surgical goal is refractive rather than restoration of vision lost due to cataract. In contrast to keratorefractive procedures, which are usually performed bilaterally in the same surgical session, RLE is usually performed as sequential surgery on separate days to minimize the potential for bilateral endophthalmitis. However, practices continue to evolve, and some surgeons are performing bilateral RLE in the same surgical session.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Preoperative corneal topography is essential to detect irregular astigmatism and to identify patients with corneal ectatic disorders, such as keratoconus and pellucid marginal degeneration. Patients with these conditions may still have RLE performed; however, they must understand the limits of vision correction obtainable and that the quality of vision may still suffer postoperatively from their irregular astigmatism. These patients must further understand that they are not good candidates for postoperative treatment with LASIK or photorefractive keratectomy to refine the refractive correction.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Surgeons must identify the degree of corneal versus lenticular astigmatism present, as only the corneal astigmatism will remain postoperatively. The patient should be informed if substantial astigmatism is expected to remain after surgery, and a plan should be devised to correct it in order to optimize the visual outcome. Small amounts of corneal astigmatism (&lt;1.00&#160;D) may be reduced if the incision is placed in the steep meridian.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Limbal relaxing incisions and arcuate keratotomies with either blade or femtosecond laser may be used to correct residual corneal astigmatism of less than 2.00&#160;D (see Chapter&#160;3). Supplemental surface ablation or LASIK could also be considered (see the following discussion on bioptics). Although glasses or contact lenses are an alternative for managing residual astigmatism, refractive surgery patients frequently reject this option.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Some surgeons obtain preoperative retinal OCT to identify potential macular pathology. Careful attention should be paid to the peripheral retinal examination, especially in patients with higher myopia. If relevant pathology is discovered, appropriate treatment or referral to a retina specialist is warranted. In patients with high axial myopia, retrobulbar injections should be performed with caution because of the risk of perforating the globe. Peribulbar, sub-&#173;Tenon, topical, and intracameral anesthesia are alternative options.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Most surgeons believe that an IOL should be implanted after RLE in a patient with high myopia rather than leaving the patient with aphakia, even when little or no optical power correction is required. Plano power IOLs are available if indicated. The IOL acts as a barrier to anterior prolapse of the vitreous, maintaining the integrity of the aqueous–vitreous barrier, in the event that Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy is required. Some IOL models also reduce the rate of posterior capsule opacification.</p>
            <p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Intraocular Lens Power Calculations in Refractive Lens Exchange</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">High patient expectations for excellent uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA; also called <span class="italic">uncorrected distance visual acuity, UDVA</span>) after RLE make accurate IOL power determination crucial. However, IOL power formulas are less accurate at higher levels of myopia and hyperopia. In addition, in high myopia, a posterior staphyloma can make the axial length measurements less reliable. Careful fundus examination and B-scan ultrasound imaging can identify the position and extent of staphylomas. The subject of IOL power determination is covered in greater detail in BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics,</span> and Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract.</span></p>
            <p class="body-text">In the case of a patient with high hyperopia, biometry may suggest an IOL power beyond what is commercially available. The upper limit of commercially available IOL power is now +40.00&#160;D. A special-&#173;order IOL of a higher power may be available or may be designed, but acquiring or designing such a lens usually requires the approval of the institutional review board at the hospital or surgical center, which delays the surgery. Another option is to use a “piggyback” IOL system, in which 2&#160;posterior chamber IOLs are inserted. One IOL is placed in the capsular bag, and the other is placed in the ciliary sulcus. When piggyback IOLs are used, the combined power may need to be increased +1.50 to +2.00&#160;D to compensate for the posterior shift of the posterior IOL. One serious complication of piggyback IOLs is the potential for developing an interlenticular opaque membrane. These membranes cannot be mechanically removed or cleared with the Nd:YAG laser; the IOLs must be removed. Interlenticular membranes have occurred most commonly between 2&#160;acrylic IOLs, especially when both IOLs are placed in the capsular bag. When piggyback lenses are used, they should be of different materials and the fixation should be split between the bag and the sulcus. Piggyback IOLs may also shallow the anterior chamber and increase the risk of iris chafing, especially in smaller eyes.</p>

            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The intraoperative and postoperative complications for RLE are identical to those of cataract surgery. See BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract,</span> Chapter&#160;8, for a comprehensive discussion of this topic.</p>

        <div id="Chapt8_Top3">
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">For some patients, the best IOL choice for implantation at the time of RLE is a monofocal IOL. There are a variety of IOL choices and styles available, and all are utilized in routine cataract surgery as well (see BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract,</span> for more detail). Patients without significant corneal astigmatism who desire best distance vision only, or individuals who have tolerated monovision well in the past and want it re-&#173;created after cataract surgery, are generally the best candidates for monofocal IOL implantation.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="h1 ParaOverride-11">Toric Intraocular Lenses</p>
        <div id="Chapt8_Top4">
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Residual astigmatism after cataract surgery impacts visual function and patient satisfaction. Large population analyses indicate that more than 50% of patients have 0.75&#160;D or more corneal astigmatism at presentation for cataract surgery, and 15%–29% have 1.50&#160;D or more corneal astigmatism. Thus, toric IOLs can address a major need for vision correction after crystalline lens removal. Current toric IOLs in the United States generally come in powers that can correct from 1.00 to 4.00&#160;D of astigmatism at the spectacle plane, and wider power ranges are available outside the United States; however, this range is continually evolving.</p>
            <p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Patient Selection</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">A toric IOL is appropriate for patients with regular corneal astigmatism, currently up to 4.00&#160;D at the corneal plane (United States). Patients with astigmatism exceeding the upper correction limits require additional measures to obtain full correction. In addition to understanding the risks associated with intraocular surgery, patients must be capable of understanding the limitations of a toric IOL. Not all patients with toric IOL implantation achieve spectacle independence for distance vision. Further, patients should be informed that toric IOL implantation will not eliminate the need for reading glasses (unless monovision is planned). The patient also needs to be informed that the IOL may rotate in the capsular bag shortly after surgery and that an additional procedure may be required to reposition it. A silicone toric IOL may be less appropriate for patients who may carry a significant potential of requiring silicone oil for retinal detachment repair in the future; thus, nonsilicone IOLs are more appropriate choices for these patients.</p>
            <p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Planning and Surgical Technique</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The amount, axis, and regularity of the astigmatism should be measured accurately. First, corneal topography should be examined to determine the regularity and axis of astigmatism and to identify eyes with irregular astigmatism or ectatic disease. Keratometry should be used to confirm the corneal power axis and provide the primary data for corneal astigmatic power. The axis of astigmatism from the refraction should not be the sole source for axis or power determination, but should be considered in context with topographic and keratometric measurements.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Significant disagreement between measurements should prompt re-&#173;examination of the clinical data and may also suggest the effect of lenticular astigmatism or posterior corneal astigmatism. Posterior corneal astigmatism may vary widely from patient to patient, but may add 0.3–0.5&#160;D of net against-the-rule astigmatic power in 80% of patients. While technology to accurately measure the posterior corneal astigmatism is evolving, surgeons may use regression formulas, such as the Baylor nomogram, or theoretical formulas, such as the Barrett toric IOL formula (available at www.ascrs.org/barrett-toric-calculator) to help compensate for the tendency of anterior corneal measurements to overestimate the with-the-rule corneal power and underestimate the against-the-rule corneal power. Intraoperative aberrometry may be useful in these cases.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The manufacturers of toric IOLs have online software available to aid in surgical planning. After the surgeon enters data such as keratometry measurements, axes, IOL spherical power generated by A-scan, average surgeon-&#173;induced astigmatism, and axis of astigmatism, these programs will generate the recommended power and model lens as well as orientation of the lens.</p>
            <p class="body-text">There are many ways that surgeons mark the cornea prior to surgery. The surgeon should establish and mark the vertical and/or horizontal meridians with the patient in an upright position to avoid potential misalignment resulting from torsional globe rotation, which sometimes occurs in the supine position. Intraoperative alignment systems are available. Cataract surgery with a wound that induces a predictable amount of astigmatism is necessary to achieve the intended benefit of a toric lens. All online toric IOL software requires input of the expected surgically induced astigmatism for lens power calculations.</p>
            <p class="body-text">After the IOL is injected into the capsular bag, the viscoelastic behind the IOL is aspirated and the IOL is rotated into position on the steep meridian. Some surgeons prefer to leave the toric IOL purposely underrotated by 10°–20° and then rotate it into position after all viscoelastic substance has been removed; others position the IOL in its planned orientation and then hold it in place with a variety of techniques while removing the viscoelastic material. If the IOL rotates beyond its appropriate position, it will need to be fully rotated around again, as the 1-piece IOLs tend not to rotate well against their haptics. This maneuver should be performed using irrigation or viscoelastic material to prevent capsule rupture during rotation.</p>

            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">In clinical trials of a 1-piece acrylic toric IOL, data provided by the FDA indicated uncorrected acuity of greater than 20/40 in 93.8% of 198&#160;patients implanted with the IOL (all sizes combined). With the plate-&#173;haptic IOL, postoperative astigmatism was less than 0.50&#160;D in 48% of patients and less than 1.00&#160;D in 75%–81% of patients; results were 61.6% and 87.7%, respectively, for the 1-piece acrylic toric IOL.</p>
            <p class="body-text">For those patients with corneal astigmatism greater than that correctable by toric IOLs, surgeons may opt to simultaneously or sequentially correct residual astigmatism with incisional or laser procedures.</p>

            <p class="h2">Complications Specific to Toric Intraocular Lenses</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The primary complication of toric IOLs is the possibility of IOL rotation resulting in a misalignment of the astigmatic correction. Full correction is not achieved unless the IOL is properly aligned in the axis of astigmatism. Astigmatism calculations have shown that every 10° off-&#173;axis rotation of the lens reduces the correction by approximately one-third. Thus, at 30° the lens is functionally astigmatically neutral, and IOL misalignment greater than 30° can increase the cylindrical refractive error. In the FDA clinical trials for a plate-&#173;haptic toric IOL, 76% of lenses were within 10° of preoperative alignment, and 95% were within 30°. In the FDA clinical trials for the 1-piece acrylic toric IOL, the degree of postoperative rotation in 242&#160;implanted eyes was 5° or less in 81.1% and 10° or less in 97.1%. None of the eyes exhibited postoperative rotation greater than 15°.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Typically, a misaligned IOL is recognized within days of the surgery; it should be repositioned before permanent fibrosis occurs within the capsular bag. However, waiting 1&#160;week for some capsule contraction to occur may ultimately help stabilize this IOL. An online calculator is available to help determine the exact amount of IOL rotation necessary to optimize visual outcome (www.astigmatismfix.com).</p>

        <div id="Chapt8_Top5">
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The light-&#173;adjustable IOL is a 3-piece silicone-&#173;optic posterior chamber IOL that can be irradiated with ultraviolet light through a slit-lamp delivery system 1–2&#160;weeks after implantation to induce a change in the shape, and thus the power, of the IOL (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;8-5</span>). This lens is not currently FDA approved but is available for use outside the United States. Specific irradiation patterns can be applied to the lens to induce myopic, hyperopic, and astigmatic shifts. In initial work, results indicate that up to 5.00&#160;D of spherical and up to 2.00&#160;D of astigmatic change can be induced. Once final irradiation is performed, the effect is “locked in” and no further adjustments can be made.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Prior to postoperative irradiation, the lens must be protected from sunlight exposure. Further, it seems possible that an error in the irradiation treatment related to centration or improper data entry could cause irreversible changes in the IOL’s visual properties and require IOL exchange surgery. Despite the refractive alterations available initially, after irradiation, the lens is functionally a monofocal IOL with all the limitations that come from that implantation strategy.

            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Accommodating lenses are another alternative for implantation during refractive lens exchange. Currently, only 1&#160;accommodating IOL and a similar accommodating toric IOL are FDA approved, although others are being investigated. Development is also currently under way for dual-&#173;optic IOLs and deformable IOLs. Additional investigational IOLs are discussed in Chapter&#160;9.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Although the accommodating lens was designed to improve distance, intermediate, and near acuity through movement of its hinged haptics during the accommodative process, studies have found limited IOL movement and limited improvement in near acuity for most patients targeted for best distance acuity. Thus, many surgeons are utilizing a “mini-&#173;monovision” strategy when implanting the accommodating IOL, leaving the nondominant eye targeted for slight myopia (–0.50 to –0.75&#160;D).</p>

        <div id="Chapt8_Top7">
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Multifocal intraocular lenses have the ability to provide appropriate patients with functional vision at near, intermediate, and far distances in each eye. This ability is due to lens multifocality that causes light rays to be split such that different focal points are created where objects will be clearest. However, all have potential trade-offs in vision quality and adverse effects, especially at night, and careful patient selection and counseling are necessary to achieve optimal outcomes. These types of lenses and their outcomes are discussed further in Chapter&#160;9.</p>
            <p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Patient Selection</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients who are likely to be successful candidates for an MFIOL implant after lens surgery tend to be adaptable, less visually demanding, and place a high value on reduced spectacle dependence at all distances. In addition, they should have good potential vision without significant pathology anywhere along the visual axis. Specific preoperative evaluation of macular function and anatomy may be warranted to exclude patients with macular degeneration, epiretinal membrane, or other conditions leading to suboptimal retinal function. Careful attention should be paid to evaluation of the corneal endothelium, as patients with Fuchs dystrophy may not be ideal candidates for MFIOLs. Significant anterior basement membrane dystrophy or tear film abnormality from dry eye syndrome or blepharitis may also adversely affect postoperative performance of these lenses. Patients with more than 0.75&#160;D residual astigmatism after MFIOL implantation frequently have suboptimal vision quality. If this result is expected, strategies to reduce postoperative astigmatism should be evaluated and discussed before IOL implantation. Evidence has shown that patients generally have better visual outcomes if MFIOLs are implanted bilaterally.</p>

            <p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Surgical Technique</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The surgical technique for MFIOL insertion is the same as that used in standard small-&#173;incision cataract surgery with a foldable acrylic IOL. MFIOLs are much more sensitive than are monofocal IOLs to minor optic decentration. If the posterior capsule is not intact, IOL decentration is more likely to occur, and adequate fixation for an MFIOL should be determined before implantation.</p>
            <p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Outcomes</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients are most likely to achieve independence from glasses after bilateral implantation of MFIOLs. Recent meta-&#173;analyses found bilateral MFIOL implantation associated with significant improvement in both distance and near visual acuity with each type of implant studied.</p>
            <p class="body-text">As patients age, the pupillary diameter may decrease. If the pupillary diameter decreases to less than 2.0&#160;mm, unaided reading ability may diminish. Gentle dilation with topical mydriatic drugs or laser photomydriasis may restore near acuity. Photomydriasis may be performed with an argon or dye photocoagulator, by placing green laser burns circumferentially outside the iris sphincter, or with a Nd:YAG photodisruptor, by creating approximately 4&#160;partial sphincterotomies.</p>

            <p class="h2">Adverse Effects, Complications, and Patient Dissatisfaction With Multifocal Intraocular Lenses</p>
            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patient concerns after MFIOL implantation can generally be divided into 2&#160;categories: blurred vision and photic phenomena (glare, halos). Patients may experience both groups of symptoms. These symptoms can occur even after uneventful surgery with a well-&#173;centered MFIOL.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Patients with MFIOLs are more likely to have significant glare, halos, and ghosting than are patients with monofocal, toric, or accommodating IOLs. These issues stem from a variety of different etiologies, including residual refractive error, ocular surface disease, or intrinsic IOL problems. The reports of halos intrinsically related to the IOL tend to subside over several months, perhaps from the patient’s neural adaptation, but they may be persistent. Because of a reduction in contrast sensitivity, the subjective quality of vision after MFIOL insertion may not be as good as after monofocal IOL implantation. The trade-off of decreased quality of vision in return for reduced dependence on glasses must be discussed fully with the patient preoperatively. With MFIOLs, intermediate vision may be less clear than distance or near acuity.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Some patients never adapt to MFIOLs and require IOL exchange to recover vision. All patients should be counseled as to this possibility before surgery. Patients with MFIOLs appear to be more sensitive to posterior capsule opacification (PCO) than are individuals with monofocal IOLs. These patients benefit from Nd:<span class="CharOverride-2">YAG</span> capsulotomy; however, tolerance of the MFIOL must be determined before undergoing the Nd:<span class="CharOverride-2">YAG</span> capsulotomy, as an open posterior capsule significantly complicates IOL exchange. Intrinsic IOL symptoms usually appear very early if not immediately in the postoperative course and do not generally worsen over time. In contrast, symptoms from PCO are not present initially but gradually worsen over the first few weeks to months after the surgical procedure.</p>

            <p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">bioptics</span> was suggested by Zaldivar in the late 1990s. It is used to describe the combination of 2&#160;refractive procedures—1&#160;intraocular and 1&#160;corneal—to treat patients with refractive errors that are suboptimally treated with a single procedure. Examples include extreme myopia, high myopia or hyperopia with significant astigmatism, and MFIOL implantation in patients with significant astigmatism. In these cases, the intraocular procedure is performed first, with keratorefractive surgery performed after both anatomical and refractive stability are achieved, usually 1–3&#160;months after the initial surgery.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Bioptics with LASIK or surface ablation are reasonable alternatives, depending on patient parameters. As new treatment options are developed, the possibilities for other combinations of refractive surgery will increase.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The ability to successfully combine refractive procedures further expands the limits of refractive surgery. The predictability, stability, and safety of LASIK increase when smaller refractive errors are treated. In addition, there is usually sufficient corneal tissue to maximize the treatment zone diameter without exceeding the limits of ablation depth. The LASIK procedure provides the feature of adjustability in the overall refractive operation. These benefits must be balanced against the combined risks of performing 2&#160;surgical procedures rather than 1.</p>
