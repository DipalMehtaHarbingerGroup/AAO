			<p class="chapter-title">Collagen Shrinkage and Crosslinking Procedures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Keratorefractive surgical procedures aim to alter the refractive power of the cornea by changing its shape. Various methods are used to alter corneal curvature, including incising or removing corneal tissue or implanting artificial material into the cornea. Procedures that change the character of the corneal collagen have also been developed. This chapter focuses on 2 such procedures: corneal collagen shrinkage and corneal crosslinking (CLL).</p>
			<p class="h1">Collagen Shrinkage</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The idea of using heat to alter the shape of the cornea was first proposed by Lans, a Dutch medical student, in 1898. When Lans used electrocautery to heat the corneal stroma, he noticed astigmatic changes in the cornea. In 1975, Gasset and Kaufman proposed a modified technique known as <span class="italic">thermokeratoplasty</span> to treat keratoconus. In 1984, Fyodorov introduced a technique of radial thermokeratoplasty that used a handheld, heated Nichrome inoculating needle designed for deeper thermokeratoplasty. The handheld probe contained a retractable 34-gauge wire heated to 600°C. For a duration of 0.3&#160;second, a motor advanced the wire to a preset depth of 95% of the corneal thickness. Fyodorov used different patterns to treat hyperopia and astigmatism. However, excessive heating of the cornea resulted in necrosis, scarring, and variable corneal remodeling; regression and unpredictability of treatment limited the success of this technique. It is now known that the optimal temperature for avoiding stromal necrosis while still obtaining corneal collagen shrinkage is approximately 58°–76°C.</p>

			<p class="h2">Laser Thermokeratoplasty</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the 1990s, numerous lasers were tested for use in laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK) but only the holmium:yttrium-aluminum-&#173;garnet (Ho:YAG) laser reached commercial production. The Ho:YAG laser produces light in the infrared region at a wavelength of 2100&#160;nm and has corneal tissue penetration to approximately 480–530&#160;µm. A noncontact system slit-lamp delivery system was used to apply 8&#160;simultaneous spots at a frequency of 5&#160;Hz and a pulse duration of 250&#160;µsec. The system was approved for the temporary correction of 0.75–2.50&#160;D of hyperopia with less than 1.00&#160;D of astigmatism. Interest in LTK waned, primarily because of the significant refractive regression that frequently occurred. Few LTK units remain in clinical use.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Conductive Keratoplasty</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In 2004, conductive keratoplasty (CK) received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for treatment of presbyopia in the nondominant eye of a patient with an endpoint of –1.00 to –2.00&#160;D. The nonablative, collagen-&#173;shrinking effect of CK is based on the delivery of radiofrequency energy through a fine conducting tip that is inserted into the peripheral corneal stroma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-1</span>). As the current flows through the tissue surrounding the tip, resistance to the current creates localized heat. Collagen lamellae in the area surrounding the tip shrink in a controlled fashion and form a column of denatured collagen. The shortening of the collagen fibrils creates a band of tightening and flattening in the periphery that increases the relative curvature of the central cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For the treatment of hyperopia, the surgeon inserts the tip into the stroma in a ring pattern around the peripheral cornea. The number and location of spots determine the amount of refractive change, with an increasing number of spots and rings used for higher amounts of hyperopia. The CK procedure is performed using topical anesthesia and typically takes less than 5&#160;minutes. The collagen shrinkage leads to visible striae between the treated spots, which fade with time (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-2</span>). The treatment is not advised for use in patients who have undergone radial keratotomy, and it is not FDA approved for such use.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Despite initial reports of refractive stability, long-term follow-&#173;up has revealed regression and/or lack of adequate effect with CK. In a long-term (mean, 73.1&#160;months; range, 44–90&#160;months) follow-&#173;up of patients enrolled in the phase&#160;3 multicenter trial of CK, Ehrlich and Manche found nearly complete regression of treatment effect in the 16&#160;eyes (of the original 25&#160;eyes) available for follow-&#173;up.</p>

			<p class="h3">Other applications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Other potential off-&#173;label uses exist for CK. In cases of overcorrected myopic LASIK and myopic photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), CK can be used to correct hyperopia. In these procedures, CK obviates the need to lift or cut another flap. CK may also be used to treat keratoconus and post-&#173;LASIK ectasia. Although in 1&#160;report corneal irregularities improved immediately, with some improvement in visual acuity, some cases showed regression of effect at 1&#160;month.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Corneal Crosslinking</p>
		    <div id="Chapt7_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal crosslinking (CCL) was first described by Seiler, Spörl, and colleagues in 1997 as the “Dresden protocol.” CCL involves the use of a riboflavin (vitamin&#160;B<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>) solution plus exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light. The activated riboflavin causes collagen fibrils in tissue to form strong chemical bonds with adjacent fibrils. In the cornea, as in the skin, crosslinking of collagen can occur naturally, due to oxidative deamination within the end chains of the collagen molecule. In addition, other pathways can lead to crosslinking of collagen.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most systems of corneal crosslinking employ oxidation through the release of oxygen<br />free radicals. Riboflavin serves as a source for the generation of singlet oxygen and superoxide anion free radicals, which are split from its ring structure after excitation by UVA irradiation. It is this interaction of oxygen free radicals generated by the combination of riboflavin and exposure to UVA light that allows for crosslinking of collagen and increase corneal rigidity. In the presence of riboflavin, approximately 95% of the UVA light irradiance is absorbed in the anterior 300&#160;µm of the corneal stroma. Therefore, a minimal corneal thickness of 400&#160;µm after epithelial removal is recommended so as to avoid corneal endothelial damage by UVA irradiation. Thinner corneas may be thickened temporarily with application of a hypotonic riboflavin formulation prior to UVA treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although there may also be a slight flattening of the cornea, the most important effect of corneal crosslinking is to stabilize the corneal curvature and prevent further steepening and bulging of the cornea in patients with ectatic conditions. There is no significant change in the refractive index or the clarity of the cornea. The primary clinical application of corneal crosslinking is to prevent the progression of keratoconus and post–corneal refractive surgery ectasia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the Dresden protocol, riboflavin solution is continually applied to the de-&#173;epithelialized cornea for 30&#160;minutes (in most studies), and the riboflavin is then activated by illumination of the cornea with UVA light for 30&#160;minutes, during which time application of the riboflavin solution continues. The resultant corneas were shown to be nearly 300% stiffer and more resistant to enzymatic digestion. Investigation also proved that the treated corneas contained higher molecular weight polymers of collagen due to fibril crosslinking. Safety studies showed that the endothelium was not damaged by the treatment if proper UV&#160;irradiance was maintained and if the corneal thickness exceeded 400&#160;µm. This type of cross-&#173;linking is commonly referred to as “epithelium-&#173;off” or “epi-off” CCL. Alternative riboflavin formulations and crosslinking techniques that avoid epithelial removal are being evaluated and seem promising.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal crosslinking has rapidly become a first-line treatment for keratoconus throughout the world and has recently been approved in the United States. Human studies of UV-induced CCL began in 2003 in Dresden, and early results were promising. The initial pilot study enrolled 16&#160;patients with rapidly progressing keratoconus and all patients stopped progressing after treatment. In addition, 70% had flattening of their steep anterior corneal curvatures (decreases in average and maximum keratometric values), and 65% had an improvement in visual acuity. There were no reported complications.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In a clinical trial in the United States, all patients with keratoconus or post-&#173;LASIK ectasia had their corneal epithelium removed. This was followed by a 30-minute application of riboflavin (0.1% diluted in 20% dextran) every 2&#160;minutes, and a subsequent 30-minute UVA treatment (365&#160;nm; 3&#160;mW/cm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> irradiation), with concomitant administration of topical riboflavin as a photosensitizer (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-3</span>). Two control groups—sham and fellow eye—were included in the study, and all patients were monitored for 1&#160;year. Treated eyes initially showed a slight steepening of the cornea with a decrease in best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (BCVA; also called <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity, CDVA</span>), followed by corneal flattening of approximately 1.00–2.00&#160;D, which peaked at between 1 and 3&#160;months after crosslinking. In addition to a reduction in corneal cylinder, a transient compaction of the cornea and an increase in BCVA were observed. There appears to be stabilization in most treated eyes. Some eyes may require re-&#173;treatment, and there have been rare cases of loss of 2 or more lines of BCVA in these studies, however.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Patient Selection</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The primary purpose of crosslinking is to stabilize the progression of ectasia. The most common indication for CCL is keratoconus. Other possible indications include pellucid marginal degeneration and ectasia resulting from refractive surgery.</p>
			<p class="h3">Contraindications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal crosslinking is relatively contraindicated in the following situations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">corneal thickness of less than 400&#160;µm (although some protocols may allow for treatment of corneas thicker than 300&#160;µm)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">prior herpetic infection (due to concern of viral reactivation)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">severe corneal scarring or opacification</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">history of poor epithelial wound healing</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">severe ocular surface disease (eg, dry eye)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-4">autoimmune disorders</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Surgical Technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Variations of CCL procedures include the original Dresden protocol procedure, transepithelial CCL, accelerated CCL, and combined techniques. All have several prerequisites in common. The primary goal of the first stage of therapy is to allow sufficient riboflavin to diffuse into the cornea. In the initial studies, riboflavin was not able to penetrate an intact epithelium, and so the standard Dresden protocol required epithelial removal in order to allow riboflavin to rapidly penetrate into the stroma. However, newer formulations of riboflavin have been shown to penetrate intact epithelium and may have the additional advantage of faster healing, faster visual recovery, less pain, and lower incidence of complications. Studies are investigating the use of iontophoresis via an electrical charge gradient to allow for more complete penetration of riboflavin through the epithelium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once riboflavin has adequately diffused into the cornea, the second component of the CCL procedure is exposure to UVA light. The standard Dresden Protocol calls <br />for 30-minute exposure to 370&#160;nm UVA with an irradiance of 3&#160;mWcm<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">–2</span> for a total of <br />5.4&#160;J/cm<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">2</span>. Newer accelerated protocols attempt to decrease the duration of UVA exposure, while maintaining the same exposure (ie, 30&#160;min at 3&#160;mWcm<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">–2</span> is equivalent to 3&#160;min at 30&#160;mWcm<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">–2</span> or 10&#160;min at 9&#160;mWcm<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">–2</span>). <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;7-1</span> reviews steps in the Dresden protocol.</p>
			<p class="h3">Transepithelial corneal crosslinking</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Postoperative discomfort, possible delayed epithelial healing, infection, stromal haze, and corneal melting represent the disadvantages of epithelial debridement that have led surgeons to explore transepithelial CCL. The reported clinical outcomes are promising. Experimental studies, however, have shown a significantly lower efficacy of transepithelial CCL compared to the standard epithelium-&#173;off approach due to the low epithelial permeability of riboflavin. Chemical agents such as benzalkonium chloride, trometamol, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, as well as the use of hypotonic riboflavin solution without dextran, may to enhance riboflavin’s penetration. The use of iontophoresis and partial disruption of the superficial epithelial layers also enhance riboflavin’s penetration through the epithelium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">No matter which approach is used, stromal saturation with riboflavin is crucial and should always be visualized (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;7-4</span>) before the UVA irradiation. Some researchers claim that, even with a sufficient stromal concentration of riboflavin, the effect of the transepithelial CCL may be decreased due to the attenuation of UVA radiation by the epithelium. That would imply that UVA energy may need to be increased or otherwise modulated beyond the current level of 5.4&#160;J/cm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> when the epithelium is kept intact.</p>

			<p class="h3">Accelerated corneal crosslinking</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">New-&#173;generation lamps have been developed to shorten the duration of UVA irradiation. Some offer fixed treatment times of 10 and 5&#160;minutes with the use of a power of 10 and 18&#160;mW/cm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>.

Kanellopoulos reported that the use of higher-&#173;fluence UVA for a shorter time (7&#160;mW/cm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> for 15&#160;minutes) is safe and effective. He found that this approach achieves similar clinical results to the Dresden protocol in terms of stabilizing ectasia.</p>

			<p class="h3">Combined techniques</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In some cases, patients do not achieve visual acuity improvement sufficient to provide functional vision after CCL treatment. Ophthalmologists, therefore, have attempted to combine CCL with various refractive surgical techniques (see Chapter&#160;12). The implantation of intracorneal ring segments with sequential or subsequent CCL treatment has proven effective. The limited use of topography-&#173;guided transepithelial PRK followed by CCL has also been shown to improve visual acuity and stabilize keratoconus. Same-day PRK followed by CCL appears to be superior to sequential PRK after CCL, and the former has been widely used as the Athens protocol. Combining CCL with the implantation of a phakic toric intraocular lens safely and effectively corrects myopic astigmatism in eyes with mild to moderate keratoconus. The triple procedure of CCL combined with topography-guided PRK to regularize the corneal shape and the implantation of a phakic intraocular to optimize the refraction may rehabilitate the patient’s vision with a higher predictability of the refractive outcome compared with CCL combined with topography-&#173;guided PRK alone.</p>

			<p class="h3">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complications of CCL may include delayed epithelial healing, corneal haze (which may be visually significant), decreased corneal sensitivity, infectious keratitis, persistent corneal edema, and endothelial cell damage.</p>
			<p class="h3">Summary</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal crosslinking is a very promising treatment modality, and studies are evaluating its place among the options for corneal therapy. In addition to conducting studies employing denuded epithelium for crosslinking, investigators are examining riboflavin penetration across intact epithelium for crosslinking. In addition, there have been reports of CCL employed successfully to treat fungal and bacterial infections of the cornea. This use may represent a potential new application of this technology.</p>
