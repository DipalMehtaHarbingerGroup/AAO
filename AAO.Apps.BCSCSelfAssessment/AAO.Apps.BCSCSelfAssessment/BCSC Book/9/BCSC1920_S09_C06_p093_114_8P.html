			</p>
			<p class="body-text">Therapy for uveitis ranges from &#173;simple observation to complex medical or surgical intervention. Many patients with mild, self-&#173;limiting anterior uveitis need no referral to a uveitis specialist. However, in uveitis that is chronic or difficult to treat, early referral to a uveitis specialist may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and determining a therapeutic regimen. Treatment may require coordination with other medical or surgical con&#173;sul&#173;tants and detailed informed consent. Discussion with the patient and other specialists about the prognosis and complications of uveitis helps determine the appropriate therapy.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Medical Management of Uveitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goal of medical management of uveitis is to effectively control disease activity to eliminate or reduce the risk of vision loss from structural complications of uncontrolled inflammation. It is critical to determine &#173;whether the uveitis is related to a systemic or ocular infection, as anti-&#173;inflammatory therapy may severely exacerbate an untreated infection. Once infection is properly addressed, any residual inflammation may be cautiously treated with adjuvant anti-&#173;inflammatory therapy. Some diseases, such as multiple evanescent white dot syndrome or acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, are self-&#173;limited and resolve without treatment. Other diseases, such as Fuchs uveitis syndrome and mild pars planitis, are chronic but do not require treatment. However, most patients with chronic uveitis benefit from sustained suppression of the inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corticosteroids are the best agents to control inflammation quickly. Route and dose are tailored to each patient, considering any systemic disease involvement and other &#173;factors, such as age, immune status, tolerance of adverse effects, local &#173;factors to the eye, and response to treatment. Systemic immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) is used widely in the treatment of noninfectious uveitis when a steroid-&#173;sparing effect is required. In the correct clinical scenario, cycloplegic agents, nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatories (NSAIDs), and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may be used as adjunctive therapy.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Corticosteroids</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corticosteroids are the mainstay of uveitis therapy. They are used to treat active inflammation in the anterior chamber, vitreous, ret&#173;ina, choroid, or optic nerve, and to treat complications such as macular edema. They may be administered locally (as topical eyedrops, or periocular or intraocular injections) or systemically (orally or intravenously or, less frequently, intramuscularly).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy must be individualized. It is generally preferable to begin therapy with a high dose of corticosteroids (topical or systemic) and taper the dose as the inflammation subsides, rather than to begin with a low dose that may have to be progressively increased to control the inflammation. To reduce the complications of therapy, patients should be maintained on the minimum dosage needed to control the inflammation. Systemic corticosteroids must be tapered gradually (over days to weeks), and not stopped abruptly if utilized for longer than 2–3 weeks to prevent cortisol deficiency, resulting from hypothalamic-&#173;pituitary-&#173;adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. If surgical intervention to treat uveitis or its complications is required, the dosage may need to be increased to prevent postoperative exacerbation of the uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For uveitis that is not immediately vision-&#173;threatening and that is not known to be chronic, corticosteroids are slowly tapered, and the disease is closely monitored. The corticosteroid dosage at which disease recrudescence occurs determines whether additional treatments are required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Given enough treatment time and dosage, any route of corticosteroid administration &#173;will have adverse effects, so the risk–&#173;benefit ratio of their use should be considered carefully and discussed with the patient. Corticosteroids in any form, but particularly local corticosteroids, can cause serious adverse effects in the eye, most notably posterior subcapsular cataract and ocular hypertension. The significant systemic risks of ste&#173;roids are discussed &#173;later in this chapter. (See also BSCS <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;1</span>, <span class="italic">Update on General Medicine,</span> and BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology</span>.)</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Topical ste&#173;roid administration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topical corticosteroid drops are effective primarily for anterior uveitis, although they may have beneficial effects on vitritis or macular edema with some patients. &#173;These drops are given at intervals ranging from once daily to hourly. The drugs can also be administered in ointment form for nighttime use. Difluprednate (0.05%), a fluorinated corticosteroid, is highly potent and has deeper tissue penetration than other topical preparations; dosing at 4 times daily is considered the equivalent of 8 or more total drops per day of prednisolone acetate (1%). Clinical studies suggest difluprednate has a similar adverse effect profile to prednisolone but is associated with potentially higher rises and rates of rise in intraocular pressure (IOP), especially in &#173;children. Of the topical preparations, loteprednol and fluorometholone produce a smaller ocular hypertensive effect than that of other medi&#173;cations; however, &#173;these drugs are not as effective as prednisolone in controlling more severe uveitis. Differences in physical properties of branded versus generic suspensions of prednisolone acetate can affect the bioavailability of the formulations, although some of this discrepancy can be overcome by vigorous agitation of the drug before instillation. (See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;2</span>, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology.</span>)</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-5">Slabaugh MA, Herlihy E, Ongchin S, Van Gelder RN. Efficacy and potential complications of difluprednate use for pediatric uveitis. <span class="reference--journal-_italic">Am J Ophthalmol.</span> 2012;153(5):932–938.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Local ste&#173;roid administration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sustained-&#173;release ste&#173;roid may be delivered directly into the vitreous cavity or into the periocular space of an eye with noninfectious uveitis when a more posterior effect is needed, or when a  patient is nonadherent or only partially responsive to topical or systemic administration. Intermediate-&#173; and short-&#173;acting local ste&#173;roid injections may be used intermittently to treat breakthrough inflammation in other&#173;wise well-&#173;controlled or mild uveitis. Long-&#173;acting intravitreal ste&#173;roids can be used as alternatives to long-&#173;term IMT in certain clinical settings. A limitation of regional therapies is the variable duration of effect, with relapse being the only sign of waning ste&#173;roid efficacy. Each relapse before reinjection or reimplantation can result in cumulative damage, creating a phenomenon called a “saw-&#173;tooth decline.” In chronic uveitis, scheduled replacement or reinjection of ste&#173;roid before the effect wears off may improve long-&#173;term prognosis.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Periocular ste&#173;roid administration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Periocular corticosteroids are generally given as depot injections into the sub-&#173;Tenon space or orbital floor. Although systemic absorption is minimal, periocular corticosteroids can cause systemic adverse effects similar to &#173;those of oral corticosteroids. Triamcinolone acetonide (40&#160;mg) and methylprednisolone acetate (40–80&#160;mg) are the most commonly used drugs. Short-&#173;acting nondepot ste&#173;roids, such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, may be injected subconjunctivally for a limited duration of effect.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Periocular injections can be performed using &#173;either a transseptal or a sub-&#173;Tenon (Nozik technique) approach (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 6-1)</span>. The technique for a sub-&#173;Tenon injection given in the superotemporal quadrant is as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-6">The upper eyelid is retracted, and the patient is instructed to look down and nasally.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;After anesthesia is applied with a cotton swab soaked in proparacaine or tetracaine, a 25-&#173; or 27-&#173;gauge, ⅝-inch needle on a 3-&#173;mL syringe is placed bevel-&#173;down against the sclera and advanced through the conjunctiva and Tenon capsule using a gentle side-&#173;to-&#173;side movement, which allows the physician to determine &#173;whether the needle has entered the sclera. If the globe does not torque with the side-&#173;to-&#173;side movement of the needle, the physician can be reasonably sure that the needle has not penetrated the sclera.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">Once the needle has been advanced to the hub, the corticosteroid is injected into the sub-&#173;Tenon space.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Complications of the superotemporal approach include upper eyelid ptosis, periorbital hemorrhage, and globe perforation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An inferotemporal sub-&#173;Tenon injection can also be performed with the Nozik technique, but a transseptal, orbital floor approach (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 6-2</span>) using a short 27-&#173;gauge needle may be preferred:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">The index fin&#173;ger is used to push the temporal lower eyelid posteriorly and to locate the equator of the globe.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The needle is inserted inferior to the globe through the skin of the eyelid and directed straight back through the orbital septum into the orbital fat to the hub of the needle.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">The needle is aspirated, and if &#173;there is no blood reflux, the corticosteroid is injected.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Complications of the inferior approach can include periorbital and retrobulbar hemorrhage, lower eyelid retractor ptosis, orbital fat prolapse with periorbital festoon formation, orbital fat atrophy, and skin discoloration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Periocular injections should be avoided in infectious uveitis; their use in necrotizing scleritis should also be avoided due to rare cases of scleral thinning and perforation (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7</span>). The physician should be aware that periocular corticosteroid injections have the potential to raise the IOP precipitously or for an extended period, particularly with the longer-&#173;acting depot drugs. If this effect occurs, the periocular ste&#173;roid may be removed surgically if it is located anterior to the septum or in a subconjunctival space.</p>

Periocular triamcinolone acetonide injections for cystoid macular edema complicating noninfectious uveitis. <span class="reference--journal-_italic">Am J Ophthalmol.</span> 2011;152(3):441–448.</p>
			<p class="h3">Intravitreal ste&#173;roid administration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intravitreal therapy achieves a higher, more predictable concentration of ste&#173;roids in the posterior segment than periocular injection. Intravitreal ste&#173;roid administration for uveitis currently takes several forms in the United States (US):&#9;</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">triamcinolone acetonide (4&#160;mg/0.1&#160;mL), preservative &#173;free, via pars plana injection with a 30-&#173;gauge needle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-8">fluocinolone acetonide implant (0.59&#160;mg), surgically implantable, via pars plana incision</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-8">fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal insert (0.18 mg), via  pars plan injection with integrated 25-gauge  injector</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">dexamethasone pellet (700 µg), biodegradable, via pars plana injection with an integrated 22-&#173;gauge injector</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide through the pars plana have been shown to produce sustained visual acuity improvements for 3–6 months in nonvitrectomized eyes; the technique is the same as for standard intravitreal injection (see BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;12</span>, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous</span>). Published lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture on intravitreal triamcinolone administration suggests a definite treatment benefit, although of limited duration, for recalcitrant uveitic macular edema. Intraocular pressure elevation may occur transiently in more than one-&#173;half of patients. Up to 25% of patients may require topical medi&#173;cations to control IOP, and 1%–2% may require filtering surgery. Infectious endophthalmitis and rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment may occur, but &#173;these complications are rare when proper technique is used. This method of treatment is not curative of chronic uveitic conditions and should be used judiciously, as its effects are relatively short lived.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A surgically implantable, sustained-&#173;release 0.59-mg fluocinolone acetonide implant is available in the US and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic noninfectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment. The implant is inserted through a small pars plana incision and sutured to the sclera.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Multicenter, controlled clinical studies have shown that the 0.59-mg implant is effective for a median of 30 months, with a mean time of 38 months to first recurrence. At 34&#160;weeks &#173;after implantation, inflammation was well controlled in nearly all eyes, and recurrence rates decreased by 90%, with 77% of patients able to discontinue systemic therapy and 96% able to discontinue local corticosteroid injections. However, nearly all phakic eyes developed cataract within 2&#160;years &#173;after implantation. Elevated IOP necessitating topical therapy developed in nearly 75% of patients &#173;after 3&#160;years, and 37% required filtering surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Postoperative complications (eg, endophthalmitis, wound leaks, hypotony, vitreous hemorrhage, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments) have been reported. Reimplantation or exchange may be performed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The 0.59-mg fluocinolone implant was compared with standard systemic therapy in the Multicenter Uveitis Ste&#173;roid Treatment (MUST) Trial, which enrolled 255 patients over 3&#160;years. Best-&#173;corrected visual acuity was not significantly dif&#173;fer&#173;ent between the 2 treatment groups at the 2- and 4.5-&#173;year primary endpoints; however, 7-&#173;year data published in 2017 showed that the change in vision from baseline favored systemic therapy by 7.1 letters, with the risk of blindness decreasing by 1% in the systemic group but increasing by 8% in the implant group. This difference appeared to be due to ret&#173;i&#173;nal damage from relapse of the uveitis before reimplantation (see Table 6-1).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A sustained-release 0.18-mg fluocinolone acetonide injectable intravitreal insert is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of noninfectious posterior uveitis. The nonbioerodible device is injected via a nonshelved wound through the pars plana into the vitreous cavity, where it releases the drug over 36 months. A prospective randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrated statistically significantly lower uveitis recurrence rates in the implant group compared to sham at 6 months (28% vs 91%) and 12 months (38% vs  98%). Cataract formation was greater in the treatment group, but no significant differences were found in IOP-lowering treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A biodegradable injectable pellet containing 700 µg of dexamethasone is approved by the US FDA and in Eu&#173;rope for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion. This implant is injected through the pars plana into the vitreous cavity by creating a shelved wound using the injector (<span class="xref-video">Video 6-1</span>). A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial demonstrated that, at 8 weeks, 47% of eyes treated with a dexamethasone implant had improved vitreous haze, compared to 12% of eyes in the sham group. Statistically significant improvements in visual acuity and macula thickness &#173;were reported, and fewer eyes required rescue medi&#173;cation. Intraocular pressure elevation and cataracts &#173;were the most commonly reported treatment-&#173;related ocular adverse effects in this study.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Systemic ste&#173;roid administration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Systemic corticosteroids are used for vision-&#173;threatening chronic uveitis when local corticosteroids are insufficient or contraindicated or when systemic disease also requires therapy. Of the many oral corticosteroid formulations that are available, prednisone is the most commonly used. The readily available blister packages of methylprednisolone, which contain predetermined taper schedules, have no role in the treatment of uveitis. Most patients require 1–1.5&#160;mg/kg/day of oral prednisone (usually no higher than 60–80&#160;mg/day), which is gradually tapered &#173;every 1–2 weeks. Doses <span class="symbol">&gt;</span>60&#160;mg/day are associated with an increased risk of ischemic necrosis of bone and should be avoided if pos&#173;si&#173;ble. The lowest pos&#173;si&#173;ble dose that &#173;will effectively quiet the ocular inflammation and minimize adverse effects is desired. If corticosteroid therapy at a dose of more than 7.5&#160;mg/day is required for longer than 3 months, IMT is indicated. Long-&#173;term use at 7.5&#160;mg or less per day shows no increased risk of ste&#173;roid adverse effects over months to years, although &#173;there are data to suggest increased cardiovascular risks with large cumulative doses of prednisone (eg,&#160;5&#160;mg/day over 20&#160;years).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In cases of an explosive onset or severe noninfectious uveitis, therapy with intravenous, high-&#173;dose, pulse methylprednisolone (1&#160;g/day infused over 1 hour) may be administered for 3 days, followed by a gradual taper of oral prednisone starting at 1–1.5&#160;mg/kg/day. Although this mode of therapy may control intraocular inflammation, it should only be administered by a physician experienced with this approach, as &#173;there are multiple adverse effects, some of which can be life-&#173;threatening.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The many adverse effects of both short-&#173; and long-&#173;term use of systemic corticosteroids must be discussed with patients, whose general health must be closely monitored, often with the assistance of an internist. Short-&#173;term risks include ocular hypertension, hyperglycemia, systemic hypertension, gastric reflux, insomnia, emotional lability, weight gain, fluid retention, and &#173;others. Intermediate-&#173;term risks include cataract, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis of joints, diabetes mellitus, and &#173;others. If pos&#173;si&#173;ble, corticosteroids should be avoided in patients at high risk for corticosteroid-&#173;induced exacerbations of existing conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, peptic ulcer or gastroesophageal reflux disease, psychiatric conditions, or a history of immune compromise).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients taking systemic corticosteroids and NSAIDs concomitantly have a higher risk of gastric ulcers; therefore, this combination is best avoided. If necessary, &#173;these and other at-&#173;risk patients should receive a histamine-&#173;H<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> receptor antagonist or proton-&#173;pump inhibitor. Patients receiving long-&#173;term systemic corticosteroid maintenance therapy should supplement their diets with calcium and vitamin D to lessen the risk of osteoporosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The following tests can be used to evaluate patients at risk for corticosteroid-&#173;induced bone loss:</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Systemic Immunomodulatory Therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The use of systemic immunomodulatory therapy (IMT; sometimes referred to as <span class="italic">immunosuppressive</span> or <span class="italic">disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs</span>, <span class="italic">DMARDs</span>) may greatly benefit patients with chronic, severe, or steroid-&#173;dependent noninfectious uveitis. &#173;These drugs can modify or regulate one or more immune functions, and work by dif&#173;fer&#173;ent mechanisms, depending on the class of the medi&#173;cation (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>, &#173;Table&#160;1-3).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Immunomodulatory medi&#173;cations may be loosely divided into nonbiologic-&#173;IMT agents and biologic agents. Nonbiologic-&#173;IMT agents are further divided into antimetabolites, T-&#173;cell inhibitors, and alkylating agents. Biologic agents, a newer and rapidly expanding group of genet&#173;ically engineered proteins targeting specific immune mechanisms, include drugs that inhibit tumor necrosis &#173;factor <span class="greek">α</span> (TNF inhibitors) and drugs inhibiting other pro-&#173;inflammatory immune mediators. In clinical practice, alkylating agents and biologic agents are more likely to be used for severe inflammation. However, use of alkylating agents has decreased due to the growing body of evidence on the relative safety and efficacy of biologic agents. Currently, the use of IMT for treating uveitis is considered off-&#173;label in the US, except for adalimumab, a TNF inhibitor, which is approved for noninfectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although many case series have been published, the largest amount of data on use of nonbiologic-&#173;IMT agents in uveitis comes from the Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Eye Diseases (SITE) Cohort Study, a standardized retrospective study that evaluated each drug’s safety, adverse effect profile, and effectiveness in clinical practice (see <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;6-1</span> and further discussion &#173;later in this section). &#173;There are limited comparative effectiveness data on the immunomodulatory medi&#173;cations for uveitis.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Indications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The use of IMT in treatment of uveitis is warranted for consideration in the following settings:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-14">vision-&#173;threatening intraocular inflammation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">inadequate response to corticosteroid treatment</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">corticosteroids contraindicated &#173;because of systemic prob&#173;lems or intolerable adverse effects</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-15">long-&#173;term corticosteroid dependence</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Certain ocular inflammatory entities warrant the early use of IMT, including ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, serpiginous choroiditis, Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease, sympathetic ophthalmia, Vogt-&#173;Koyanagi-&#173;Harada (VKH) syndrome, and necrotizing scleritis associated with systemic vasculitis. Although &#173;these disorders may initially respond well to corticosteroids, the initial treatment of &#173;these entities with IMT has been shown to improve long-&#173;term prognosis and lessen visual morbidity. Several expert-&#173;panel recommendations have been published to establish consensus on how and when to select, initiate, modify, and withdraw nonbiologic-&#173;IMT or biologic agents.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before initiation of IMT, the physician should evaluate the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-14">absence of infection</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">absence of recent live vaccine administration</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">absence of hepatic, renal, and hematologic contraindications</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">absence of pregnancy or breastfeeding</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">&#173;family planning and contraception</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">meticulous follow-up available from a physician who is, by virtue of training and experience, qualified to counsel, prescribe, and safely monitor such medi&#173;cations and personally manage their potential toxicities</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">objective longitudinal evaluation of the disease pro&#173;cess</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-16">informed consent</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There may be a delay in therapeutic response for weeks to months &#173;after initiation of nonbiologic-&#173;IMT; biologic agents typically have a more rapid onset. Most patients need to be maintained on corticosteroids &#173;until the immunomodulatory agent begins to take effect, at which time the corticosteroid dose may be gradually tapered.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because of the potentially serious complications associated with the use of IMT, patients must be monitored closely by a practitioner experienced with IMT. Blood monitoring, including complete blood count with differential and liver and renal function tests, should be performed regularly. Serious complications of nonbiologic-&#173;IMT include renal and hepatic toxicity and bone marrow suppression. Alkylating agents may cause sterility and are associated with an increased risk of malignancies, such as leukemia or lymphoma. Certain biologic agents may promote an infusion or injection reaction; TNF inhibitors increase the risk of multiple sclerosis and lymphoma. All IMT increases the risk of opportunistic and secondary infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, the SITE cohort study of 7957 patients (66,802 patient-&#173;years) with noninfectious uveitis treated with IMT showed that patients who took azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, or systemic corticosteroids had overall cancer mortality rates similar to &#173;those who never took &#173;those medi&#173;cations; the study confirmed that TNF inhibitors &#173;were associated with increased overall (twofold) and cancer (3.8-fold) risk of mortality. While &#173;there is no direct evidence in uveitis patients, IMT may be associated with an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer, warranting sunscreen counseling. Trimethoprim–&#173;sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis against <span class="italic">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> infection should be considered in patients receiving alkylating agents, or in &#173;those on intermediate-&#173;term high-&#173;dose ste&#173;roids and IMT. The physician should obtain thorough informed consent prior to initiating IMT.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Male and female patients require counseling regarding fertility, birth control, and &#173;family planning prior to initiation of IMT. Many IMT medi&#173;cations have absolute contraindications in pregnancy. Generally, IMT should be discontinued 3 months prior to trying to conceive.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-18">Nonbiologic Immunomodulatory Therapy</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Antimetabolites</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The antimetabolites include azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil. Clinical &#173;trials are lacking, but retrospective series report that, compared with the other antimetabolites, azathioprine has a slightly higher incidence of adverse effects and mycophenolate mofetil has a significantly shorter time to treatment success. Antimetabolites are often the first IMTs used when corticosteroid sparing is desired. A head-&#173;to-&#173;head randomized prospective study of 80 uveitis patients assigned to methotrexate or mycophenolate reported similar efficacy of the 2 medi&#173;cations. While generally effective, ongoing low-&#173;dose systemic corticosteroid therapy is often necessary to achieve complete inflammatory control. When initiated, &#173;these medi&#173;cations require long-&#173;term use, as disease control continues to improve between 6 and 12 months of follow-up.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Azathioprine, a purine nucleoside analogue, interferes with DNA replication and RNA transcription. Azathioprine is administered orally at a dose of up to 2&#160;mg/kg/day in adults. Nausea, vomiting, and upset stomach are the most common adverse effects. Bone marrow suppression is unusual at the doses of azathioprine used to treat uveitis. However, patients taking allopurinol and azathioprine concomitantly are at higher risk for bone marrow suppression. Mild hepatic toxicity can usually be reversed by dose reduction. On average, 25% of patients discontinue therapy due to adverse effects. Complete blood counts and liver function tests must be closely monitored. The variability of clinical response to azathioprine among patients is prob&#173;ably caused by ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variability in the activity of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). A genotypic test is available that can help determine patient candidacy for azathioprine therapy before treatment and can help clinicians individualize patient doses. Evaluation of TPMT activity has revealed 3 groups of patients:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-11">low/no TPMT activity (0.3% of patients); azathioprine therapy not recommended</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">intermediate TPMT activity (11% of patients); azathioprine therapy at reduced dosage</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">normal/high TPMT activity (89% of patients); azathioprine therapy at higher doses than in patients with intermediate TPMT activity</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Azathioprine is beneficial in many types of noninfectious ocular inflammatory diseases, including Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease, intermediate uveitis, VKH syndrome, sympathetic ophthalmia, and necrotizing scleritis. Overall, nearly 50% of patients treated with azathioprine achieve inflammatory control and can taper the prednisone dosage to 10&#160;mg/day or&#160;less.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Methotrexate</span> is a folic acid analogue and inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase; it inhibits DNA replication, but its anti-&#173;inflammatory effects result from extracellular release of adenosine. Treatment with this medi&#173;cation is unique in that it is given &#173;either orally or subcutaneously as a <span class="italic">weekly</span> dose of up to 15–25&#160;mg/week in adults. The dosage is variable in &#173;children and depends on body surface area. Methotrexate can be given orally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously and is usually well tolerated. It has greater bioavailability when given parenterally. Folate is given concurrently at a dose of 1–2&#160;mg/day to reduce adverse effects. Methotrexate may take up to 6&#160;months to produce its full effect in controlling intraocular inflammation. Gastrointestinal distress and anorexia may occur in 10% of patients. Reversible hepatotoxicity occurs in up to 15% of patients, and cirrhosis occurs in fewer than 0.1% of patients receiving methotrexate long-&#173;term. Methotrexate is teratogenic; mixed data exist on safety of male conception while on methotrexate therapy. Complete blood counts and liver function tests should be conducted regularly. Numerous studies have shown methotrexate to be effective in treating vari&#173;ous types of uveitis, including juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)–associated anterior uveitis, sarcoidosis, panuveitis, and scleritis. It has been a first-&#173;line choice for IMT in &#173;children. Uncontrolled clinical &#173;trials have shown that it can enable corticosteroid sparing in two-&#173;thirds of patients with chronic ocular inflammatory disorders. Intravitreal methotrexate is used for primary intraocular lymphoma; its role in uveitis and macular edema is being investigated.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Mycophenolate mofetil</span> inhibits both inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and DNA replication. It is given orally at a dosage of 1–1.5&#160;g twice daily in adults. Median time to successful control of ocular inflammation (in combination with less than 10&#160;mg/day of prednisone) is approximately 4 months. Fewer than 20% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil have adverse effects—&#173;reversible gastrointestinal distress and diarrhea are common—&#173;and &#173;these can usually be managed by dose reduction. Very few patients find the drug intolerable. Regular laboratory monitoring is required to check for adverse effects. Two large, retrospective studies found mycophenolate mofetil to be an effective corticosteroid-&#173;sparing agent in up to 85% of patients with chronic uveitis. It has similar efficacy in &#173;children (88%) and can be a safe alternative to methotrexate in patients with pediatric uveitis.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cyclosporine, a macrolide product of the fungus <span class="italic">Beauveria nivea,</span> and tacrolimus, a product of <span class="italic">Streptomyces tsukubaensis,</span> are calcineurin inhibitors that eliminate T-cell receptor signal transduction and downregulate interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene transcription and receptor expression of CD4<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> T lymphocytes.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cyclosporine</span> is available in 2 oral preparations. One is a microemulsion (Neoral, Novartis) and has better bioavailability than the standard formulation (Sandimmune, Novartis). &#173;These 2 formulations are not bioequivalent. The microemulsion is initiated at 2&#160;mg/kg/day, and the standard formulation at 2.5&#160;mg/kg/day in adults. Dosing is adjusted based on trough levels, toxicity, and clinical response to 1–5&#160;mg/kg/day. The most common adverse effects with cyclosporine are systemic hypertension and nephrotoxicity. Additional adverse effects include paresthesia, gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, hypertrichosis, and gingival hyperplasia. Blood pressure, serum creatinine levels, and complete blood counts must be assessed regularly. If serum creatinine levels rise by 30%, dose adjustment is required; sustained elevation requires medi&#173;cation cessation. Cyclosporine was shown to be effective in a randomized, controlled clinical trial for the treatment of Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et uveitis, with control of inflammation in 50% of patients. However, the dose used in this study was 10&#160;mg/kg/day—&#173;substantially higher than current dosing (5&#160;mg/kg/day)—&#173;and led to substantial nephrotoxicity. Even at standard dosages, toxicity necessitating cessation of therapy is more common in patients over the age of 55&#160;years. Overall, cyclosporine is modestly effective in controlling ocular inflammation (33.4% and 51.9% of patients by 6&#160;and 12 months, respectively). As with antimetabolites, the need for ongoing low-&#173;dose systemic corticosteroid therapy is often necessary to achieve complete inflammatory control.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Tacrolimus</span> is given orally at 0.10–0.15&#160;mg/kg/day in adults. &#173;Because of its lower dose and increased potency, its main adverse effect, nephrotoxicity, is less common than with cyclosporine. Serum creatinine level and complete blood counts are monitored regularly. The dose is escalated &#173;until a therapeutic trough blood level is reached. A prospective trial of cyclosporine and tacrolimus suggested equal efficacy in controlling chronic posterior and intermediate uveitis, with tacrolimus demonstrating greater safety (lower risk of hypertension and hyperlipidemia). Long-&#173;term tolerability and efficacy are excellent as well, with an 85% chance of reducing prednisone dosage to less than 10&#160;mg/day. A randomized uveitis trial of tacrolimus monotherapy versus tacrolimus plus prednisone showed no difference, confirming that ste&#173;roid discontinuation can be achieved in many cases.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-19">Alkylating agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Alkylating agents include cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil. &#173;These drugs are generally used only if other immunomodulators fail to control uveitis, and their use may now be partially supplanted by the targeted efficacy and preferred safety profile of the biologic agents. The most worrisome adverse effect of alkylating agents is an increased risk of malignancy. Use of alkylating agents for a limited duration may be justifiable for severe, vision-&#173; or life-&#173;threatening recalcitrant disease, but other&#173;wise cancer risk may be a relevant constraint on use of this approach. Patients with polycythemia rubra vera treated with chlorambucil had a 13.5-fold-greater risk of leukemia. Patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis treated with cyclophosphamide had a 2.4-fold-increased risk of cancer and a 33-&#173;fold-increased risk of bladder cancer. With the doses and durations used for the treatment of uveitis, the risk is prob&#173;ably lower. Nonetheless, &#173;these drugs should be used with &#173;great caution and only by clinicians experienced in the management of their dosing and potential toxicity. Patients may wish to consider sperm or embryo banking before beginning cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil therapy &#173;because of the high rate of sterility if the cumulative dose exceeds certain limits. Alkylating agents may be used as first-&#173;line therapy for necrotizing scleritis associated with systemic vasculitides, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis or relapsing polychondritis. &#173;These drugs have been found beneficial as well in patients with intermediate uveitis, VKH syndrome, sympathetic ophthalmia, and Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cyclophosphamide</span> is an alkylating agent whose active metabolites alkylate purines in DNA and RNA, resulting in impaired DNA replication and cell death. It is prob&#173;ably more effective in controlling ocular inflammation when given orally at a dose of 2&#160;mg/kg/day in adults than when administered as intermittent intravenous pulses. The dose is adjusted to maintain leukocyte counts between 3000 and 4000 cells/µL &#173;after the patient has been tapered off corticosteroids. Myelosuppression and hemorrhagic cystitis are the most common adverse effects. Hemorrhagic cystitis is more common when cyclophosphamide is administered orally, but fluid intake of more than 2&#160;L/day reduces the risk. Complete blood counts and urinalysis are monitored weekly to monthly. Microscopic hematuria is a warning for the patient to increase hydration, and gross hematuria is an indication to discontinue therapy. If the leukocyte count falls below 2500 cells/µL, cyclophosphamide should be discontinued &#173;until the cell count recovers. Other toxicities include teratogenicity, sterility, and reversible alopecia. Opportunistic infections such as <span class="italic">Pneumocystis </span><span class="italic">jirovecii</span> pneumonia occur more commonly in patients receiving cyclophosphamide; trimethoprim–&#173;sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis is recommended for &#173;these patients. Inflammation control is achieved in three-&#173;fourths of patients within 12 months; disease remission occurs in two-&#173;thirds of patients within 2&#160;years; and one-&#173;third of patients discontinue therapy within 1 year &#173;because of reversible adverse effects.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Chlorambucil</span> is a very long-&#173;acting alkylating agent that also interferes with DNA replication. It is absorbed well when administered orally. The drug is traditionally given as a single daily dose of 0.1–0.2&#160;mg/kg in adults. It may also be administered as short-&#173;term, high-&#173;dose therapy. &#173;Because chlorambucil is myelosuppressive, complete blood counts should be monitored closely. Like cyclophosphamide, it is associated with increased hematologic malignancy risk. It is also teratogenic and &#173;causes sterility. Uncontrolled case series suggest that chlorambucil is effective, providing long-&#173;term, drug-&#173;free remissions in 66%–75% of patients with recalcitrant sympathetic ophthalmia, Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease, and other vision-&#173;threatening uveitic syndromes.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Biologic agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Inflammation is driven by a complex series of cell–&#173;cell and cell–&#173;cytokine interactions. Inhibitors of vari&#173;ous cytokines and inflammatory mechanisms have been labeled <span class="italic">biologic agents</span> or, occasionally, <span class="italic">biologic response modifiers.</span> They play an impor&#173;tant role in the treatment of uveitis, as &#173;these drugs result in targeted immunomodulation, thereby theoretically reducing the short-&#173;term systemic adverse effects that are common with the previously discussed nonbiologic immunomodulatory drugs. Biologic agents are considerably more expensive and may carry higher long-&#173;term risks of serious infections or secondary malignancies than anti&#173;metabolites and T-&#173;cell inhibitors. Therefore, biologic agents are reserved for specific conditions, such as Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease or situations in which nonbiologic-&#173;IMT agents have failed.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Tumor Necrosis &#173;Factor Inhibitors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The best-&#173;studied inhibitors of TNF-&#173;<span class="greek">α</span> for uveitis are adalimumab and infliximab; their emergence over the last de&#173;cade has changed the management of some types of uveitis. &#173;There is expert consensus that the TNF inhibitors should be considered first-&#173;line for Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease. Other TNF inhibitors include certolizumab and golimumab, which have far fewer uveitis data, and etanercept, which is not effective for ocular inflammatory diseases. TNF-&#173;<span class="greek">α</span> is believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of JIA, ankylosing spondylitis, and other spondyloarthropathies. &#173;These drugs are generally prescribed and administered by uveitis specialists and rheumatologists experienced with their use, adverse effects, and toxicities. TNF inhibitors have been associated with central ner&#173;vous system demyelination (promoting or unmasking multiple sclerosis), increased risk of malignancy (such as lymphoma), hepatitis B reactivation, and deep fungal and other serious aty&#173;pi&#173;cal infections. Their use may be contraindicated in congestive heart failure, and latent tuberculosis must be ruled out or completely treated with oversight of a specialist in infectious diseases prior to use. Live vaccines should not be administered to a patient taking TNF inhibitors. Although individual case reports have been made for intravitreal TNF inhibitors, their intravitreal use is untested, potentially retinotoxic, and should not be used without further study.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Adalimumab</span>, a fully &#173;human monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody directed against TNF-&#173;<span class="greek">α</span> is the first US FDA–&#173;approved systemic medi&#173;cation for noninfectious uveitis. Self-&#173;administered via subcutaneous injection, the initial dosage is 80&#160;mg, followed by a maintenance dose of 40&#160;mg/0.8&#160;mL &#173;every other week starting 1 week &#173;after the initial dosage. &#173;Because it is a fully &#173;human antibody, risk of antidrug–&#173;antibody formation is lower than in infliximab, a mouse/human chimeric antibody. Injection site reactions may occur and are usually mild. An industry-&#173;sponsored, randomized, double-&#173;masked controlled trial in adults with noninfectious uveitis (VISUAL I/II), with an open label extension arm (VISUAL III) demonstrated that adalimumab was associated with significant reductions in treatment failure compared to placebo for both active and controlled uveitis. Also, significantly higher rates of quiescence and steroid-&#173;free quiescence &#173;were achieved and maintained through 52 weeks compared to placebo, regardless of disease status at entry. Adverse events and serious adverse events &#173;were reported more frequently among patients who received adalimumab compared to placebo.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adalimumab has been shown to be as effective as infliximab in controlling inflammation, with success rates of up to 88% without relapse in pediatric patients with uveitis and 100% in adult patients with Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, uveitis relapses requiring local corticosteroid injections may occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of anterior uveitis flares and recurrences in HLA-&#173;B27–associated uveitis. Another randomized, placebo-&#173;controlled trial—&#173;involving patients with JIA-&#173;associated uveitis (SYCAMORE) comparing methotrexate alone to methotrexate plus adalimumab—&#173;demonstrated that the addition of adalimumab reduced time to treatment failure and increased likelihood of reducing topical ste&#173;roid usage. Adverse events in this pediatric study &#173;were seen in 5% of the adalimumab group, 22% of which &#173;were considered serious adverse events. (See also &#173;Table&#160;6-1.)</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Infliximab</span> is a mouse/human-&#173;chimeric, immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1<span class="greek">κ</span>) monoclonal antibody directed against TNF-<span class="greek">α</span>. It is administered through infusions at weeks 0, 2, and 4 and &#173;every 4–8 weeks thereafter for maintenance. It is effective in controlling current inflammation and decreasing the likelihood of &#173;future attacks in Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et uveitis, undifferentiated uveitis, sarcoidosis, VKH syndrome, and many other entities in more than 75% of patients. Similar favorable effects have been reported in patients with HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;associated anterior uveitis treated with infliximab. However, one study showed that despite treatment success, nearly one-&#173;half of patients could not complete the 50 weeks of therapy &#173;because of adverse events, including drug-&#173;induced lupus, systemic vascular thrombosis, congestive heart failure, new malignancy, demyelinating disease, and vitreous hemorrhage. As many as 75% of patients receiving more than 3 infusions developed antinuclear antibodies; greater likelihood of antibody formation may occur with higher doses and more frequent infusions. Increasing the dose and frequency may benefit the most severe ocular inflammatory diseases, however. Low-&#173;dose methotrexate (5–7.5&#160;mg/week) may be administered concomitantly to reduce the risk of drug-&#173;induced lupus syndrome and the formation of &#173;human antichimeric antibodies, which can lead to reduced efficacy of infliximab.</p>
