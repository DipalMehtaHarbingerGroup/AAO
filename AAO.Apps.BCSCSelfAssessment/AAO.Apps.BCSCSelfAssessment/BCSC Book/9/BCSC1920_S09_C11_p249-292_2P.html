			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h4-head">Anterior uveitis</span> Acute anterior uveitis can be associated with herpetic viral disease. BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="h4-text_italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> extensively discusses herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-&#173;zoster virus (VZV) infections. Anterior uveitis in herpetic viral infections may be associated with corneal involvement (keratouveitis) but also occurs without noticeable keratitis. The inflammation may become chronic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chickenpox (varicella), which is caused by the same virus that is responsible&#160;for secondary VZV reactivation, may be associated with an acute, mild, nongranulomatous, self-&#173;limiting, and bilateral anterior uveitis. Cutaneous vesicles at the tip of the nose (Hutchinson sign) indicate nasociliary nerve involvement and a greater likelihood that the eye &#173;will be affected (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-1</span>). Most patients are asymptomatic; however, monitored prospectively, up to 40% of patients with primary VZV infection may develop anterior uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Herpes zoster (HZ) is defined as varicella zoster emerging from latency, and herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is defined as HZ within V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> (ophthalmic division of cranial nerve V). In HZO, the most commonly affected patients are between the ages of 50 and 69, and the eye may or may not be involved. Ophthalmic manifestations of HZO include keratitis, uveitis, conjunctivitis, episcleritis, scleritis, acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis, and cranial nerve palsy. Potential skin manifestations include a painful vesicular eruption within the V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> dermatome. Infection with VZV can be considered in the differential diagnosis of chronic unilateral anterior uveitis, even if the cutaneous component of the condition occurred in the past or was minimal when pres&#173;ent. Patients may develop anterior uveitis without ever having had a cutaneous component (varicella-&#173;zoster sine herpete).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with intraocular viral infections, particularly with herpes group viruses, may exhibit granulomatous, nongranulomatous, or stellate (fine and fibrillar) keratic precipitates (KPs). If stellate KPs develop, they are often distributed diffusely, as opposed to a regional distribution in the inferior third of the cornea. Diffuse or stellate KPs are not pathognomonic of any par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar condition. For example, Fuchs uveitis syndrome (FUS, historically known as <span class="italic">Fuchs heterochromic uveitis)</span> may also feature diffuse stellate KPs. Also, notably, patients with herpetic keratouveitis may exhibit diffuse or localized decreased corneal sensation and neurotrophic keratitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular hypertension associated with herpetic uveitis may be a helpful diagnostic hallmark. Most other inflammatory syndromes are associated with decreased intraocular pressure (IOP) as a result of ciliary body hyposecretion. However, herpesvirus may cause trabeculitis and thus increase IOP, often to as high as 50–60&#160;mm Hg. In addition, inflammatory cells may contribute to trabecular obstruction and congestion. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-&#173;related anterior uveitis may also pres&#173;ent with high IOP (see the section on glaucomatocyclitic crisis in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>). Other potential findings associated with herpesvirus include &#173;hyphema, hypopyon, posterior synechia, KPs, and corneal edema.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Iris atrophy is characteristic of herpetic inflammation and can be pres&#173;ent with HSV-&#173;, VZV-&#173;, or CMV-&#173;associated anterior uveitis. The atrophy may be patchy or sectoral (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-2</span>) and is visualized as transillumination defects upon retroillumination at the slit lamp (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Viral retinitis may occur with &#173;these entities, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Vasculitis may occur with HZO, and it may lead to anterior segment ischemia, ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion, and scleritis. Vasculitis in the orbit may cause cranial nerve palsies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment for viral anterior uveitis includes topical corticosteroids and cycloplegic agents. Topical antiviral drugs are in&#173;effec&#173;tive for intraocular inflammation but may prevent dendritic disease in patients receiving topical ste&#173;roids. Systemic antiviral drugs such as acyclovir (400–800&#160;mg, 5 times/day), famciclovir (250–500&#160;mg, 3 times/day), or valacyclovir (500&#160;mg to 1&#160;g, 3 times/day) may help treat HSV- or VZV-&#173;related intraocular inflammation, with the higher doses used for VZV uveitis. Initiation of oral antiviral therapy at the onset of VZV uveitis is recommended. Patients with herpetic uveitis may require prolonged corticosteroid therapy with very gradual tapering. In fact, some patients with VZV infection require very long-&#173;term, albeit extremely low, doses of topical corticosteroids (as infrequent as 1 drop per week) for the condition to remain quiescent. Systemic corticosteroids are sometimes necessary. Long-&#173;term, suppressive, low-&#173;dose antiviral therapy may be indicated in patients with herpetic uveitis, but controlled studies are lacking. The oral prophylactic dosage for patients with herpes simplex is acyclovir, 400&#160;mg 2 times/day, or valacyclovir, 500&#160;mg/day. For VZV disease, dosage is either acyclovir, 800&#160;mg 2 times/day, or valacyclovir, 1&#160;g/day.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis, progressive outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis, and nonnecrotizing herpetic retinitis</span><span class="h4-head"> </span>The necrotizing retinopathies include acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis (ARN), CMV retinitis, and progressive outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis (PORN). Ret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions of presumed herpetic etiology that are not consistent with ARN, CMV retinitis, or PORN are grouped &#173;under the umbrella designation <span class="h4-text_italic">nonnecrotizing herpetic retinopathy.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis may occur in healthy adults or &#173;children, but may also occur in immunocompromised patients, including patients with HIV. Acute, fulminant disease may arise without a systemic prodrome, often months or years &#173;after primary infection or following cutaneous or systemic herpetic infection such as chickenpox, herpes zoster, or herpetic encephalitis. Patients may have a history of recurrent cutaneous herpetic outbreaks. The prevalence is nearly equal between the sexes, with the majority of cases clustering in patients between the fifth and seventh de&#173;cades of life. The American Uveitis Society has established criteria for the diagnosis of ARN solely on the basis of clinical findings and disease progression, in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent of viral etiology or host immune status (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;11-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with ARN usually pres&#173;ent with acute unilateral loss of vision, photophobia, floaters, and pain. Fellow eye involvement occurs in approximately 36% of cases, usually within 6 weeks of disease onset, but sometimes months or years &#173;later. Panuveitis develops, beginning with significant anterior segment inflammation, Keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and elevated IOP, together with heavy vitreous cellular infiltration and oftentimes vitreous haze. Within 2 weeks, the classic triad of occlusive ret&#173;i&#173;nal arteriolitis, vitritis, and a multifocal yellow-&#173;white peripheral retinitis evolves. Early on, the peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions may be discontinuous and have scalloped edges that appear to arise in the outer ret&#173;ina. Within days the lesions coalesce to form a confluent 360° creamy retinitis that progresses in a posterior direction, leaving full-&#173;thickness ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis, arteriolitis, phlebitis, and occasional ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage in its wake (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-4</span>). Widespread necrosis of the peripheral and midzonal ret&#173;ina, multiple posterior ret&#173;i&#173;nal breaks, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy may lead to combined tractional–&#173;rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments in 75% of patients (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 11-5, 11-6</span>). Optic nerve swelling and a relative afferent pupillary defect may develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In most cases, the diagnosis is made clinically. The differential includes CMV retinitis, aty&#173;pi&#173;cal toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis, syphilis, lymphoma, leukemia, and autoimmune retinitis with ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis such as that of Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease. Acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis may also be pres&#173;ent in association with concurrent or antecedent herpetic encephalitis (HSV-1 or -2).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, classically intraocular antibody production was assayed from an aqueous humor sample, and a Goldmann-&#173;Witmer (GW) coefficient calculated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of aqueous or vitreous specimens has largely supplanted viral culture, intraocular antibody titers, and serology. For presumed ARN, aqueous sampling is usually sufficient. Quantitative PCR may add information with re&#173;spect to viral load, disease activity, and response to therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Studies using PCR-&#173;based assays suggest that the most common cause of ARN is VZV infection, followed by infections with HSV-1, HSV-2, and, in rare cases, CMV. Patients with ARN caused by HSV-1 or VZV infection tend to be older (mean age, 40&#160;years), whereas &#173;those with ARN due to HSV-2 infection tend to be younger (below age 25&#160;years). &#173;There is a higher risk of encephalitis and meningitis among patients with ARN caused by HSV-1 infection than by VZV infection. In rare cases in which PCR results are negative but the clinical suspicion for necrotizing herpetic retinitis is high, endoret&#173;i&#173;nal biopsy may be diagnostic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Timely diagnosis and prompt initiation of antiviral therapy are essential, given the rapidity of disease progression, the frequency of ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, and the guarded visual prognosis. Intravenous acyclovir, 10&#160;mg/kg &#173;every 8 hours for 10–14 days, is effective against HSV and VZV. Reversible elevations in levels of serum creatinine and liver enzymes may occur; in the presence of frank renal insufficiency, the dosage &#173;will need to be reduced. &#173;After 24–48 hours of antiviral therapy, systemic corticosteroids (prednisone, 1&#160;mg/kg/day) are introduced to treat active inflammation and are subsequently tapered over several weeks. Aspirin and other anticoagulants have been used to treat an associated hypercoagulable state and prevent vascular occlusions, but the results have been inconclusive. Following intravenous antiviral induction for VZV infection, treatment with acyclovir at 800&#160;mg orally 5 times daily, valacyclovir at 1&#160;g orally 3 times daily, or famciclovir at 500&#160;mg orally 3 times daily should be continued for 3 months. For ARN associated with HSV-1 infection, the follow-on oral dose is one-&#173;half of that for VZV. Extended antiviral therapy may reduce the incidence of contralateral disease or bilateral ARN by 80% over 1 year.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Oral valacyclovir at doses of up to 2&#160;g 3 times daily has been used successfully as an alternative to intravenous acyclovir as induction therapy. In addition, intravitreal ganciclovir (2.0&#160;mg/0.05 or 0.1&#160;mL) and foscarnet (1.2–2.4&#160;mg/0.1&#160;mL) have been used to achieve a rapid induction in combination with both intravenous and oral antivirals as first-&#173;line therapy or for disease that fails to respond to systemic acyclovir (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span>). High-&#173;dose systemic oral therapy, alone or in combination with intravitreal antiviral drugs, has not been demonstrated as superior to the classic intravenous approach. Given the short intravitreal half-&#173;life of &#173;these drugs, injections may need to be repeated twice weekly &#173;until the retinitis is controlled. Effective treatment inhibits the development of new lesions and promotes lesion regression over 4 days.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment may occur within weeks to months of disease onset. The use of prophylactic barrier &#173;laser photocoagulation, applied to the areas of healthy ret&#173;ina at the posterior border of the necrotic lesions once the view permits, is controversial and employed by some prac&#173;ti&#173;tion&#173;ers. If detachment occurs, vitrectomy techniques are preferred over standard scleral buckling. Optic nerve atrophy may be visually limiting even with a favorable ret&#173;i&#173;nal anatomic outcome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Progressive outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis is a morphologic variant of acute necrotizing herpetic retinitis, occurring in &#173;those who are profoundly immunosuppressed, most often in advanced AIDS (CD4<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-2">+</span> T lymphocytes <span class="symbol">≤</span>50 cells/µL). The most common cause of PORN is VZV infection; HSV has also been isolated. As with ARN, the retinitis begins as patchy areas of outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal whitening that coalesce rapidly. In contrast to ARN, the posterior pole may be involved early in the disease course, significant vitreous cell and haze are typically absent, and the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculature is minimally involved, at least initially (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-7</span>). Patients with PORN and HIV infection or AIDS frequently have a history of cutaneous zoster (67%) and eventually incur bilateral involvement (71%); they also have a similarly high rate (70%) of ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment as in ARN. The visual prognosis is poor; in the largest series reported to date, 67% of patients had a final visual acuity of no light perception. Although PORN is often resistant to treatment with intravenous acyclovir alone, successful management has been reported with combination systemic and intraocular therapy using foscarnet and ganciclovir. Long-&#173;term suppressive antiviral therapy is required in patients with HIV/AIDS who are not able to achieve immune reconstitution through combination antiretroviral treatment. See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;12</span>, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous,</span> for additional discussion of viral retinitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nonnecrotizing herpetic retinitis (nonnecrotizing posterior uveitis) may occur in patients with herpetic infections, including acute retinochoroiditis with diffuse hemorrhages following acute VZV infection in &#173;children and chronic choroiditis or ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis in adults. Patients may be immune competent or immune compromised. In a study using PCR-&#173;based assays and local antibody analy&#173;sis of aqueous fluid samples for herpesviruses, a viral etiology was confirmed in 13% of cases deemed “idiopathic posterior uveitis.” Inflammation is typically bilateral, and the disorder may pres&#173;ent with uveitic macular edema, as a birdshot uveitis–&#173;like chorioretinopathy, or as an occlusive bilateral retinitis. The disease is initially resistant to conventional therapy with systemic corticosteroids and/or immunomodulatory therapy (IMT), but favorable response is achieved when patients are switched to systemic antiviral medi&#173;cation.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Cytomegalovirus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cytomegalovirus is a double-&#173;stranded DNA virus in the Herpesviridae &#173;family. It is the most common cause of congenital viral infection and &#173;causes clinically relevant disease in neonates. It also &#173;causes illness in immunocompromised &#173;children and adults (leukemia, lymphoma, or HIV/AIDS), transplant recipients, and patients with conditions requiring systemic IMT. CMV retinitis is the most common ophthalmic manifestation of both congenital CMV infection and CMV as an opportunistic coinfection in patients with HIV/AIDS. The clinical appearance is similar regardless of clinical context, with 3 distinct variants:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-11">a classic or fulminant retinitis with large areas of ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage against a background of whitened, edematous, or necrotic ret&#173;ina. The retinitis typically appears in the posterior pole, near the vascular arcades, in the distribution of the nerve fiber layer, and associated with blood vessels (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-8</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">a granular or indolent form found more often in the ret&#173;i&#173;nal periphery, characterized by &#173;little or no hemorrhage, edema, or vascular sheathing. Active retinitis may pro&#173;gress from the borders of the lesion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-9</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-12">a perivascular form often described as a variant of “frosted-&#173;branch” angiitis, an &#173;undifferentiated ret&#173;i&#173;nal perivasculitis initially described in immunocompetent &#173;children (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-10</span>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of congenital CMV disease is suggested by the clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion; positive serum antibodies or PCR testing of urine, saliva, or intraocular fluids; and systemic findings. Serum antibody testing may be useful 5–24 months &#173;after the loss of maternal antibodies transferred &#173;after pregnancy. Congenital CMV retinitis is usually associated with other systemic manifestations of disseminated infection, including fever, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pneumonitis, and hepatosplenomegaly; the reported prevalence in &#173;children with congenital CMV infection is between 11% and 22%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, CMV retinitis has been reported to occur &#173;later in life among &#173;children with no discernible lesions ophthalmoscopically and no evidence of systemic disease reactivation. This pattern suggests that even asymptomatic &#173;children with evidence of congenital CMV infection should be monitored at regular intervals for potential ocular involvement &#173;later into childhood. Resolution of the retinitis leaves both pigmented and atrophic lesions, with ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment occurring in up to one-&#173;third of &#173;these &#173;children. Optic atrophy and cataract formation are not uncommon sequelae.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of CMV retinitis in patients with HIV/AIDS or undergoing IMT is essentially clinical. Early CMV retinitis may pres&#173;ent as a small, white ret&#173;i&#173;nal infiltrate and look like a cotton-&#173;wool spot. Patients may have coincidental HIV-&#173;associated retinopathy (dot-&#173;blot hemorrhages, cotton-&#173;wool spots), and early CMV retinitis is distinguished by its inevitable progression without treatment. In patients with aty&#173;pi&#173;cal lesions or whose disease is not responding to therapy, early treatment and close follow-up are impor&#173;tant. Polymerase chain reaction testing of aqueous or vitreous may help differentiate CMV from necrotizing retinitis secondary to HSV1/2 or VZV and from toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. Toxoplasmosis may masquerade as a viral retinitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prior to modern antiretroviral therapy, an estimated 30% of patients with HIV/AIDS, usually with CD4<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-2">+</span> T lymphocyte counts <span class="symbol">≤</span>50 cells/µL, experienced CMV retinitis. Secondary to breaks in areas of peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis, rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments occurred at a rate of approximately 33% per eye per year. Modern antiretroviral regimens have reduced the incidence of CMV retinitis and its associated complications, such as ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, by 80%. This decrease has stabilized, and new cases of CMV retinitis can occur in patients where combination antiretroviral treatment fails or in &#173;those who abandon treatment or experience immune reconstitution but do not develop CMV-&#173;specific immunity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cytomegalovirus reaches the eye hematogenously, with passage of the virus across the blood–&#173;ocular barrier, infection of ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular endothelial cells, and cell-&#173;to-&#173;cell transmission of the virus within the ret&#173;ina. The histologic features of both congenital and acquired disease include a primary, full-&#173;thickness, coagulative necrotizing retinitis and secondary diffuse choroiditis. Infected ret&#173;i&#173;nal cells show pathognomonic cytomegalic changes consisting of large eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions and small basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. Viral inclusions may also be pres&#173;ent in the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE) and vascular endothelium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Management of CMV retinitis requires antiretroviral regimens and anti-&#173;CMV therapy. Anti-&#173;CMV therapy is particularly impor&#173;tant, since CMV retinitis signifies a twofold-increased mortality risk in patients with a CD4<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-2">+</span> T-&#173;cell count below 100 cells/µL (an effect not observed with counts <span class="symbol">≥</span>100 cells/µL). Resistant CMV infection is further associated with increased mortality in patients with HIV/AIDS and CMV retinitis. Options for systemic coverage include high-&#173;dose induction with &#173;either intravenous ganciclovir (5&#160;mg/kg twice daily) or foscarnet (90&#160;mg/kg twice daily) for 2 weeks followed by low-&#173;dose daily maintenance therapy or oral valganciclovir (900&#160;mg twice daily) for 3 weeks followed by maintenance therapy (900&#160;mg/day).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intravitreal injection of ganciclovir or foscarnet effectively treats intraocular disease and is a useful alternative in patients who cannot tolerate intravenous therapy &#173;because of myelotoxicity. However, intravitreal therapy alone leaves extraocular systemic CMV and the fellow eye untreated. Combination treatment with oral valganciclovir may ameliorate this limitation. This combination is also useful for vision-&#173;threatening, posteriorly located retinitis. In patients with CMV retinitis who are on antiretroviral regimens and experience sustained immune recovery (CD4<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-2">+</span> T lymphocytes <span class="symbol">≥</span>100 cells/µL for 3–6 months), systemic anti-&#173;CMV maintenance therapy may be safely discontinued. Antiretroviral therapy–&#173;naive patients may require only 6 months of anti-&#173;CMV therapy with good immune reconstitution, whereas antiretroviral therapy–&#173;experienced patients may require long-&#173;term maintenance therapy. Despite immune recovery, patients with a history of CMV retinitis who discontinue maintenance anti-&#173;CMV therapy remain at risk for recurrence and should be monitored at 3-&#173;month intervals.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with immune recovery may, months or years &#173;later, develop intermediate uveitis in the absence of CMV reactivation. Rather, the reconstituted immune system reacts to residual CMV antigens within the eye. Cystoid macular edema may develop. Topical, periocular, and oral ste&#173;roids are utilized. Initial aggressive anti-&#173;CMV therapy initiated at the same time as antiretroviral treatment may ultimately decrease the incidence of immune recovery uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Among immunocompetent adults, CMV infection may produce a chronic or recurrent unilateral anterior uveitis associated with ocular hypertension, corneal edema, and variable degrees of sectoral iris atrophy. Positive PCR testing of aqueous fluid for CMV DNA combined with negative testing for HSV and VZV is diagnostic. Treatment options for CMV anterior uveitis include systemic anti-&#173;CMV treatment (usually valganciclovir), topical ganciclovir gel 0.15%, and intravitreal ganciclovir injections. Relapses are common &#173;after discontinuation of therapy.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Epstein-&#173;Barr virus </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epstein-&#173;Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous double-&#173;stranded DNA virus with a complex capsid and envelope; it belongs to the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. EBV is commonly associated with infectious mononucleosis (IM) and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma (especially among African &#173;children), nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin disease, and Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren syndrome. EBV has a tropism for B lymphocytes, the only cells known to have surface receptors for the virus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular manifestations may arise either as a consequence of congenital EBV infection or, more commonly, during primary infection in the context of IM. Cataract may occur with congenital EBV infection. In contrast, a mild, self-&#173;limiting follicular conjunctivitis is most common with acquired IM. Other, less frequently reported anterior ocular manifestations of acquired IM include epithelial or stromal keratitis; episcleritis; bilateral, granulomatous anterior uveitis; dacryoadenitis; and, less frequently, cranial nerve palsies and Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A variety of posterior segment manifestations have been reported in association with EBV infection, including isolated optic disc edema and optic neuritis, macular edema, ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages, retinitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-11</span>), punctate outer retinitis, choroiditis, multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis (MCP), pars planitis and vitritis, progressive subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis, uveitis, and secondary choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis has also been reported. Epstein-&#173;Barr virus is rarely a cause of &#173;these findings in the absence of proper systemic context (eg, recent IM). Antibody testing against a variety of EBV-&#173;specific capsid antigens is rarely useful given the very high seroprevalence of EBV (90%) in the adult population; PCR assay from intraocular fluid can be helpful.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most EBV-&#173;associated ocular disease is self-&#173;limiting. The presence of anterior uveitis may necessitate topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia. Systemic corticosteroids can treat posterior segment inflammation. Systemic antiviral therapy for EBV infection may be considered for the management of necrotizing retinitis/ARN.</p>

			<p class="h2">Rubella</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The rubella virus is the prototypical teratogenic viral agent. It consists of single-&#173;stranded RNA surrounded by a lipid envelope, or “toga,” hence its inclusion in the Togaviridae &#173;family. Although rubella remains an impor&#173;tant cause of blindness in resource-&#173;limited regions and nations, the epidemic pattern of the disease was interrupted in the United States by introduction of the rubella vaccine in 1969. The peak age incidence shifted from 5–9&#160;years (young &#173;children) in the prevaccine era to 15–19&#160;years (older &#173;children) and more recently to 20–24&#160;years (young adults). Approximately 5%–25% of &#173;women of childbearing age are susceptible to primary infection. Rubella may involve the ret&#173;ina as part of the congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) or during acquired infection (German measles).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The fetus is infected with the rubella virus transplacentally, secondary to maternal viremia during the course of primary infection. The frequency of fetal infection is highest during the first 10 weeks and the final month of pregnancy, with the rate of congenital defects varying inversely with gestational age. Although obvious maternal infection during the first trimester of pregnancy may end in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or severe fetal malforma&#173;tions, seropositive asymptomatic maternal rubella may also result in severe fetal disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The classic features of CRS include cardiac malformations (patent ductus arteriosus, interventricular septal defects, and pulmonic stenosis), ocular findings (chorioretinitis, cataract, corneal clouding, microphthalmia, strabismus, and glaucoma), and deafness (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-12</span>). Hearing loss is the most common systemic finding. Individuals with CRS are at greater risk for diabetes mellitus and subsequent diabetic retinopathy &#173;later in life.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A unilateral or bilateral pigmentary retinopathy is the most common ocular manifestation of CRS (25%–50%), followed by cataract (15%) and glaucoma (10%). The pigmentary disturbance, often described as “salt-&#173;and-&#173;pepper” fundus, shows considerable variation, ranging from finely stippled, bone spicule–&#173;like, small, black, irregular masses to gross pigmentary irregularities with coarse, blotchy mottling (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-13</span>). It can be stationary or progressive. Despite loss of the foveal light reflex and prominent pigmentary changes, neither vision nor electroretinogram results are typically affected. Congenital (nuclear) cataracts and microphthalmia are the most frequent &#173;causes of poor visual acuity and, rarely, CNV. &#173;Unless other&#173;wise compromised by glaucoma, the optic nerve and the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels are typically normal in appearance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Histologic studies of the lens reveal retained cell nuclei in the embryonic nucleus as well as anterior and posterior cortical degeneration. Poor development of the pupil dilator muscle, necrosis of the iris pigment epithelium, and chronic nongranulomatous inflammation may be pres&#173;ent in the iris. The RPE displays alternating areas of atrophy and hypertrophy. The anterior chamber &#173;angle appears similar to that of congenital glaucoma. Although the mechanism of rubella embryopathy is not known at the cellular level, it is thought that the virus inhibits cellular multiplication and establishes a chronic, per&#173;sis&#173;tent infection during organogenesis. The per&#173;sis&#173;tence of viral replication &#173;after birth, with ongoing tissue damage, is central to the pathogenesis of CRS and may explain the appearance of hearing and neurologic and/or ocular deficits long &#173;after birth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The pigmentary ret&#173;i&#173;nal changes and associated systemic findings, together with a history of maternal exposure to rubella, suggest the diagnosis of CRS. Serologic criteria for rubella infection include a fourfold increase in rubella-&#173;specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in paired sera 1–2 weeks apart or the new appearance of rubella-&#173;specific IgM. &#173;Because the fetus is capable of mounting an immune response to the rubella virus, specific IgM or IgA antibodies to rubella in the cord blood confirm the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of congenital rubella retinitis consists of entities constituting the TORCH (<span class="italic">t</span>oxoplasmosis, <span class="italic">o</span>ther agents, <span class="italic">r</span>ubella, <span class="italic">c</span>ytomegalovirus, and <span class="italic">h</span>erpesviruses) syndrome. See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;6</span>, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>, for additional discussion of congenital rubella. Other viral illnesses, such as mumps, roseola subitum, and postvaccination encephalitis, should be considered and ruled out by appropriate serologic tests. &#173;There is no specific antiviral therapy for congenital rubella, and treatment is supportive.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Acquired infection (German measles) pres&#173;ents with a prodrome of malaise and fever in adolescents and adults before onset of the rubella exanthem. An erythematous, maculopapular rash appears first on the face, spreads &#173;toward the hands and feet, involves the entire body within 24 hours, and dis&#173;appears by the third day. Although the rash is not always prominent and the occurrence of fever is variable, lymphadenopathy is invariably pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most frequent ocular complication of postnatally acquired rubella is conjunctivitis (70%), followed by the infrequent occurrence of epithelial keratitis and retinitis. Acquired rubella retinitis has been described in adults presenting with acute-&#173;onset decreased vision and multifocal chorioretinitis, with large areas of bullous neurosensory detachment, under&#173;lying pigment epithelial detachment involving the entire posterior pole, anterior chamber and preret&#173;i&#173;nal vitreous cells, dark gray atrophic lesions of the RPE, normal appearance of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels and optic nerve, and absence of ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage. The neurosensory detachments resolve spontaneously, and visual acuity returns to normal. Chronic rubella virus infection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of FUS, as evidenced by the presence of rubella-&#173;specific intraocular antibody production and the intraocular per&#173;sis&#173;tence of the virus (for more detailed discussion of FUS, see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Uncomplicated acquired rubella does not require specific therapy; however, rubella retinitis and postvaccination optic neuritis may respond well to systemic corticosteroids.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital and acquired measles infection is caused by a single-&#173;stranded RNA virus of the genus <span class="italic">Morbillivirus</span> in the Paramyxoviridae &#173;family. The virus is highly contagious and is transmitted &#173;either directly or via aerosolization of nasopharyngeal secretions to the mucous membranes of the conjunctiva or respiratory tract of susceptible individuals, or transplacentally from a pregnant &#173;woman to her fetus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Despite the existence of an effective vaccine, measles remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide among &#173;children. In the United States, however, measles is rare.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Congenital measles infection may cause cataract, optic nerve head drusen, and a bilateral diffuse pigmentary retinopathy involving the posterior pole and ret&#173;i&#173;nal peri&#173;phery. The retinopathy may be associated with normal or attenuated ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels, ret&#173;i&#173;nal edema, and macular star formation. Electroretinographic results and visual acuity are usually normal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common ocular manifestations of acquired measles are keratitis and a mild, papillary, nonpurulent conjunctivitis. Corneal scarring in countries with prevalent malnutrition may cause post-&#173;measles blindness, a significant prob&#173;lem worldwide.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Measles retinopathy is more common in acquired than in congenital disease, presenting with profound loss of vision 6–12 days &#173;after the appearance of the characteristic exanthem; it may be accompanied by encephalitis. Measles retinopathy is characterized by attenuated arterioles, diffuse ret&#173;i&#173;nal edema, macular star formation, scattered ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages, blurred disc margins, and clear media. Optic disc pallor and a secondary pigmentary retinopathy with &#173;either a bone spicule or salt-&#173;and-&#173;pepper appearance may subsequently develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of congenital measles retinopathy includes the TORCH entities, aty&#173;pi&#173;cal retinitis pigmentosa, and neuroretinitis. For acquired measles retinopathy, considerations include central serous chorioretinopathy, Vogt-&#173;Koyanagi-&#173;Harada (VKH) syndrome (bullous detachments may resolve, leaving extensive RPE disruption), retinitis pigmentosa, syphilis, and other viral retinopathies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of measles and its ocular sequelae is made clinically and through serologic testing. Systemic corticosteroids should be considered in cases of acute measles retinopathy.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, late complication of acquired measles infection. It most often affects unvaccinated &#173;children 6–8&#160;years &#173;after the primary infection. In late childhood or adolescence, visual impairment, behavioral disturbances, and memory impairment may insidiously develop, followed by myoclonus and progression to spastic paresis, dementia, and death within 1–3&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular findings are reported in up to 50% of patients with SSPE and may precede the neurologic manifestations by several weeks to 2&#160;years. The most consistent finding is a maculopathy, consisting of focal retinitis and RPE changes, occurring in 36% of patients (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-14</span>). Retinitis may pro&#173;gress to involve the peripheral ret&#173;ina. Other findings include disc swelling and papilledema, optic atrophy, macular edema, macular pigment epithelial disturbances, small intraret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages, gliotic scar, whitish ret&#173;i&#173;nal infiltrates, serous macular detachment, drusen, preret&#173;i&#173;nal membranes, macular hole, cortical blindness, hemianopsia, horizontal nystagmus, and ptosis. Characteristically, &#173;there is &#173;little, if any, vitritis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis is based on clinical examination, electroencephalographic abnormalities, raised IgG antibody titer against measles in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, and/or panencephalitis found on magnetic resonance imaging or brain biopsy.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">West Nile Virus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">West Nile virus (WNV) is a single-&#173;stranded RNA virus of the &#173;family Flaviviridae; it belongs to the Japa&#173;nese encephalitis virus serocomplex and is endemic to Eu&#173;rope, Australia, Asia, and Africa. The virus is transmitted from birds (the natu&#173;ral host) to &#173;humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. The peak onset of the disease occurs in late summer, but it can occur anytime between July and December. The incubation period ranges from 3 to 14 days. Eighty &#173;percent of WNV infections are subclinical. Twenty &#173;percent of infections pres&#173;ent as a febrile illness, often accompanied by myalgia, arthralgia, headache, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and a maculopapular or roseolar rash. Severe neurologic disease (meningitis or encephalitis) may occur, frequently found in association with diabetes mellitus and advanced age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Presenting ocular symptoms include pain, photophobia, conjunctival hyperemia, and blurred vision. A characteristic multifocal chorioretinitis is pres&#173;ent in most patients, together with nongranulomatous anterior uveitis and vitreous inflammatory cells. Chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions vary in size (200–1000 µm) and number and may affect the midzone and/or posterior pole, often in linear arrays following the course of ret&#173;i&#173;nal nerve fibers. Active lesions appear whitish to yellow, are flat and deep, and evolve with varying degrees of pigmentation and atrophy.</p>
			<p class="body-text"> Fluorescein angiography reveals central hypofluorescence with late staining of active lesions, and early hyperfluorescence with late staining of inactive lesions. Inactive or partly active lesions may show a target-&#173;like appearance with central hypofluorescence caused by blockage from pigment and peripheral hyperfluorescence due to atrophy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-15</span>). Indocyanine green angiography reveals hypofluorescent spots, more numerous than &#173;those apparent on fluorescein angiography or funduscopy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other findings may include intraret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages, disc edema, optic atrophy, and, less commonly, focal ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular sheathing and occlusion, cranial nerve VI palsy, and nystagmus. Congenital WNV infection has been reported in an infant presenting without intraocular inflammation but with chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal scarring.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In most patients, intraocular inflammation associated with WNV infection has a self-&#173;limiting course, with a return of visual acuity to baseline &#173;after several months. Loss of vision may occur &#173;because of CNV, foveal scar, ischemic maculopathy, vitreous hemorrhage, tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, optic nerve pathology, and retrogeniculate damage. Diabetes mellitus has been implicated as a risk &#173;factor for WNV-&#173;related death and may increase the risk of WNV-&#173;associated ocular involvement.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular findings in patients with systemic symptoms suggestive of WNV infection or with meningoencephalitis may suggest the diagnosis and may prompt serologic testing. The differential diagnosis includes syphilis, MCP, histoplasmosis, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Currently &#173;there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for WNV infection. Patients receive supportive therapy. Anterior uveitis may be treated with topical ste&#173;roids. The efficacy of systemic and periocular corticosteroids for chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal manifestations is unknown. Public health strategies directed at prevention are the mainstays of WNV infection control.</p>

Patients pres&#173;ent with blurred vision and floaters caused by a mild granulomatous anterior uveitis (20%), unilateral vitritis (60%), membranous vitreous opacities, and/or “snowballs.” Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis (60%), exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions (25%), optic disc abnormalities (20%), and uveitic &#173;macular edema (3%) may also be observed. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis is responsive to corticosteroids.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For cases that pro&#173;gress despite therapy, the clinician must consider a masquerade syndrome, as ret&#173;i&#173;nal infiltration caused by ATL (see Fig<span class="xref-figure">&#160;11-17</span>) and ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration associated with HAM/TSP may mimic HU.

			<p class="h2">Dengue Fever</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dengue fever is the most common mosquito-&#173;borne viral disease in &#173;humans. A member of the Flaviviridae &#173;family and transmitted by the <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> mosquito, dengue is endemic within more than 100 countries in the tropical and subtropical regions of the globe.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic signs and symptoms include fever, headache, myalgia, purpuric rash, and other bleeding manifestations secondary to thrombocytopenia. For many patients, however, this initial infection may be low grade and escape obvious mention &#173;unless specifically elicited upon history. The most common ocular manifestation is petechial subconjunctival hemorrhage. A variable degree of anterior chamber and vitreous cells may occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Maculopathy or “foveolitis” may develop in approximately 10% of patients 1 month &#173;after the onset of systemic disease, causing a sudden decrease in vision and central scotoma. Fluorescein angiography may show early focal arteriolar knobby hyperfluorescence in the macula with late leakage and/or staining; optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography may show disruption of the foveal avascular zone (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-18</span>). Despite no apparent lesions on clinical exam, OCT may show macular edema, subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid, or disruption of the inner segment/outer segment junction.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis is based on clinical findings combined with positive serologic testing. While the infection is not endemic to the United States, dengue virus–&#173;associated maculo&#173;pathy should be considered in patients presenting with suggestive findings and a history of recent travel to an endemic area. &#173;There is no well-&#173;defined treatment algorithm for dengue affecting the posterior segment, but local and systemic ste&#173;roids may be utilized.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chikungunya fever is a potentially fatal illness resembling dengue fever that is caused by an arthropod-&#173;borne <span class="italic">Alphavirus.</span> Patients pres&#173;ent with fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, and skin rash. Chikungunya translates to “that which bends up,” a reference to the polyarthropathy, tenosynovitis, and stooped posture of some affected patients. The virus is typically transmited to &#173;humans via mosquito bite. Maternal-&#173;fetal transmission has been documented. Recent outbreaks have occurred in Africa, Asia, Eu&#173;rope, and the Amer&#173;i&#173;cas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ocular manifestations in a 2006 epidemic in India included both anterior uveitis and retinitis, and, less frequently, nodular episcleritis. Each had a typically benign course. The anterior uveitis may be granulomatous or nongranulomatous and associated with diffuse pigmented KPs, iris pigment release, and elevated IOP. Chikungunya retinitis may resemble herpetic retinitis. However, chikungunya retinitis features focal, multifocal, or confluent retinochoroiditis in the posterior pole with ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage and minimal vitritis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-19</span>), while herpetic retinitis includes the peripheral ret&#173;ina and a more intense vitritis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnosis may be confirmed serologically by IgM antibodies, virus isolation, or PCR. Although retinitis has been treated with systemic acyclovir and prednisone, &#173;there is no evidence to suggest that such therapy improves visual outcome.</p>

			<p class="h2">Zika Virus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Zika virus (ZIKV), an arbovirus and member of the Flaviviridae &#173;family, is named &#173;after a forest in Uganda. Similar to dengue and chikungunya viruses, mosquitos (often <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span>) transmit ZIKV to &#173;humans. Coinfection with any of &#173;those 3 distinct viral diseases may occur in endemic areas. Sexual transmission has been reported. A large proportion of patients infected with ZIKV &#173;will have no symptoms or minimal symptoms (fever, headache, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis) that typically resolve within a week.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Acute infection in adults has been reported to cause individual cases of conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis with numerous chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions, and unilateral acute maculopathy. &#173;There is no defined treatment, but topical, systemic, or local ste&#173;roids may be considered.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Brazil experienced an epidemic of ZIKV that began in April&#160;2015. A 20-&#173;fold spike in newborns with microcephaly was noted in the ensuing months, suggesting ZIKV congenital infection. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has defined congenital Zika syndrome with the following 5 features:</p>

			<p class="h2">Ebola Virus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in Congo. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with blood or body fluids or needles/syringes from a person who is sick or who has died from Ebola infection. Sexual contact with semen from a man who has recovered from Ebola is debated as a pos&#173;si&#173;ble mode of transmission. Symptoms are fever, bruising, headache, weakness and fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain. Patients with acute EVD may experience conjunctivitis, conjunctival hemorrhage, and acute vision loss of unclear etiology. Symptoms may appear 2–21 days &#173;after initial exposure. &#173;There is no vaccine or curative medi&#173;cation for EVD; treatment is aggressive supportive care.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Survivors of EVD may experience “post–Ebola virus disease syndrome,” which can include arthralgias, myalgias, fatigue, weight loss, headache, neurocognitive deficits, and psychosocial issues. Uveitis can affect Ebola survivors. In 1 patient, Ebola virus was isolated from aqueous humor 9 weeks &#173;after viremia resolved. Iris heterochromia and uveal edema may develop (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-21</span>). Ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelial cells may be a potential reservoir for the virus. Patients may have episcleritis, interstitial keratitis, anterior uveitis, chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-22</span>), or optic neuropathy. Uveitis relapses may occur up to 13 months &#173;after a negative PCR test on serum.</p>
			<p class="h2">Other Viral Diseases</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute anterior uveitis may also occur with other viral infectious entities. The uveitis observed with influenza, adenovirus infection, and IM is mild and transient. Synechiae and ocular damage seldom occur. Uveitis associated with adenovirus infection is usually secondary to corneal disease (see BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea)</span>.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Fungal Uveitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (OHS) is a multifocal chorioretinitis presumed to be caused by infection with <span class="italic">Histoplasma capsulatum</span> early in life. Primary infection occurs &#173;after inhalation of the fungal spores. Hematogenous dissemination likely results in ocular disease. Initial infection is usually asymptomatic. The initial focal infection of the choroid may subside and leave an atrophic scar and depigmentation of the RPE. The choroiditis may disrupt Bruch membrane, choriocapillaris, and RPE, allowing proliferation of subret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels years &#173;later. The syndrome is usually found in endemic areas such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys but may occur in nonendemic areas as well. Men and &#173;women are affected equally, and the vast majority of patients are of northern Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean descent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis is suggested by the clinical triad of multiple white, atrophic choroidal scars (so-&#173;called <span class="italic">histo spots</span>); peripapillary pigment changes; and macular CNV in the absence of vitreous cells. Histo spots may appear in the macula or periphery, are discrete and punched out, and are usually asymptomatic (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-23</span>). Approximately 1.5% of patients from endemic areas exhibit typical peripheral histo spots, first appearing during adolescence. &#173;Linear equatorial streaks are pres&#173;ent in 5% of patients (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-24</span>). In contrast, metamorphopsia and a profound reduction in central vision herald macular CNV and bring the patient to the attention of the ophthalmologist. The mean age of patients presenting with maculopathy is 41&#160;years. Funduscopy of active neovascular lesions reveals a yellow-&#173;green subret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane typically surrounded by a pigment ring. &#173;There may be associated intraret&#173;i&#173;nal or subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid and subret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage. Subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis may develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis includes entities associated with CNV, such as age-&#173;related macular degeneration, myopic degeneration, angioid streaks, choroidal rupture, undifferentiated CNV, MCP, and punctate inner choroidopathy. Granulomatous fundus lesions (toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, syphilis, sarcoidosis, and toxocariasis) may mimic the scarring of OHS.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Over time, new choroidal scars develop in more than 20% of patients; however, only 3.8% of &#173;these cases pro&#173;gress to CNV. If histo spots appear in the macular area, the patient has a 15% chance of developing CNV within 5&#160;years; if no spots are observed, the chances fall to 5%. Occasionally massive subret&#173;i&#173;nal exudation and hemorrhagic ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments may occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The early, acute granulomatous lesions of OHS are rarely seen but may be treated with oral or regional (periocular) corticosteroids (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-25</span>). Early in a fluorescein angiography image, foci of active choroiditis hypofluoresce. &#173;These lesions hyperfluoresce in a staining pattern late in the imaging.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In contrast, areas of active CNV hyperfluoresce early and then hyperfluoresce in a leak pattern in &#173;later fluorescein angiography. Intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors have become mainline therapy for OHS-&#173;associated macular CNV. One large retrospective study suggests &#173;little benefit to combining VEGF inhibitor therapy with photodynamic therapy. See BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous</span>, for further detail about thermal &#173;laser photocoagulation, PDT, VEGF inhibitors, intravitreal corticosteroids, and submacular surgery for the treatment of CNV.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Toxoplasmosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of infectious posterior uveitis in adults and &#173;children. It is caused by the parasite <span class="italic">Toxoplasma gondii,</span> a single-&#173;cell obligate intracellular apicomplexan parasite with a worldwide distribution (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-26</span>). Felines are the definitive hosts of <span class="italic">T gondii,</span> and &#173;humans and a variety of other animals serve as intermediate hosts. <span class="italic">T gondii</span> has a complex life cycle and exists in 3 major forms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">the oocyst, or soil form (10–12 µm), which contains sporozoites</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">the tachyzoite, or infectious form (4–8 µm)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">the tissue cyst, or latent form (10–200 µm), which contains as many as 3000 bradyzoites</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Transmission of <span class="italic">T gondii</span> to &#173;humans and other animals may occur with all 3 forms of the parasite through a variety of vectors. The oocysts reproduce in the cat intestine and are shed in feces, contaminating the environment. &#173;After maturation in the soil, &#173;these oocysts may then be ingested by intermediate hosts. Tachyzoites, the proliferative form of the parasite, are found in the circulatory system and may invade nearly all host tissue. In an immunocompetent host, tachyzoites proliferation eventually stops. However, some microorganisms may persist as dormant bradyzoites within intercellular tissue cysts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As of this writing, the CDC estimates that 11% of the United States population age 6 and older has been infected with <span class="italic">T gondii.</span> Of that group, 2% may develop ocular toxoplasmosis. The reported seropositivity rates among healthy adults vary considerably worldwide. An estimated 80% of the population in southern Brazil is infected with <span class="italic">T gondii,</span> and up to 18% of &#173;these individuals may develop eye disease. Some studies show a greater genotypic heterogeneity of parasites in Brazil than in North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca. Such differences may contribute to variance in disease severity and ocular involvement in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent regions of the world.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Human infection by <span class="italic">T gondii</span> may be &#173;either acquired or congenital. The principal modes of transmission include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">ingestion of undercooked, infected meat containing tissue cysts</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ingestion of contaminated &#173;water, fruit, or vegetables with oocysts</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">inadvertent contact with cat feces, cat litter, or soil containing oocysts</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">transplacental transmission with primary infection during pregnancy</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">blood transfusion or organ transplantation</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Five of the epidemics that occurred between 1979 and 2003 have been well studied, and contaminated &#173;water supplies or inhaled/ingested sporulated oocysts in dirt &#173;were implicated as sources of infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Data collected from the 2009–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study shows an age-&#173;adjusted seroprevalence among &#173;women of childbearing age (15–44&#160;years) of 9.1% in the United States population. Thus, most &#173;women of childbearing age in the United States are susceptible to <span class="italic">T gondii</span> infection. The American Acad&#173;emy of Pediatrics estimates that the incidence of primary infection during pregnancy in the United States is approximately 0.2–1.1 per 1000 pregnant &#173;women, translating to 800–4400 &#173;women per year with acute <span class="italic">T gondi</span> infection during the 4 million yearly pregnancies in the U.S.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Overall, 40% of primary maternal infections result in congenital infection; transplacental transmission is highest during the third trimester. The risk of severe disease developing in the fetus is inversely proportional to gestational age. Disease acquired early in pregnancy may result in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or severe congenital disease. Disease acquired &#173;later in gestation may produce an asymptomatic, normal-&#173;appearing infant with latent infection. Chronic or recurrent maternal infection during pregnancy is not thought to confer a significant risk of congenital toxoplasmosis &#173;because maternal immunity protects against fetal transmission. However, congenital toxoplasmosis may occur in an immune pregnant &#173;mother reinfected with a new, more virulent strain.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pregnant &#173;women without serologic evidence of <span class="italic">T gondii</span> infection should be advised to take the following precautions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Avoid ingestion of raw/undercooked meat (freezing at −20°C/−4°F overnight also destroys tissue cysts).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Drink only well-&#173;filtered or boiled &#173;water.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Carefully wash vegetables and fruits before consumption.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Use gloves and wash hands and kitchen utensils well &#173;after &#173;handling meat or soil.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">Avoid contact with felines and their feces (including in soil or litter boxes).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The classic pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of congenital toxoplasmosis, which includes retinochoroiditis, hydrocephalus or microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, and cognitive impairment (Sabin’s tetrad), occurs in less than 10% of infected &#173;children. Retinochoroidal lesions, found in up to 80% of cases, are the most common abnormality in patients with congenital toxoplasmosis. Lesions are bilateral in approximately 85% of affected individuals and carry a predilection for the posterior pole and macula (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-27</span>). Posterior segment involvement may be subclinical and chronic. As many as 85% of infected &#173;children develop retinochoroiditis &#173;after a mean of 3.7&#160;years, and 25% of &#173;these become blind in 1 or both eyes. Most experts recommend antiparasitic therapy for newborns with congenital toxoplasmosis during the first year of life to reduce disease burden, regardless of the presence of ocular and/or systemic signs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although toxoplasmosis &#173;after infancy was previously considered exclusively congenital disease reactivation, it is now recognized that ocular toxoplasmosis in &#173;children and adults may represent newly acquired infection in a significant proportion of cases. In one study, acquired postnatal infection was thought to represent up to two-&#173;thirds of cases of toxoplasmic ocular disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although dependent on the location of the lesion, presenting symptoms frequently include unilateral blurred or hazy vision and floaters. A mild to moderate granulomatous anterior uveitis is often observed, and up to 20% of patients have acutely elevated IOP at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion. Classically, ocular toxoplasmosis appears as a focal, white retinochoroiditis, with overlying moderate vitreous inflammation (“headlight in the fog”), often adjacent to a pigmented retinochoroidal scar (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 11-28</span>, <span class="xref-figure">11-29</span>). &#173;These lesions occur more commonly in the posterior pole but are occasionally found immediately adjacent to or directly involving the optic nerve; they may be mistaken for optic neuritis. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels in the vicinity of an active lesion may show perivasculitis with diffuse venous sheathing and segmental arterial plaques (Kyrieleis arteriolitis). Vascular occlusions may also be pres&#173;ent. Additional ocular complications include cataract, per&#173;sis&#173;tent vitreous opacities, macular edema, ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membranes, optic atrophy, and CNV. Recently acquired disease often pres&#173;ents as a focal retinochoroiditis in the absence of a retinochoroidal scarring (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-30</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retinochoroiditis developing in immunocompromised and older patients may pres&#173;ent with aty&#173;pi&#173;cal findings, including large, multiple, and/or bilateral lesions, with or without associated retinochoroidal scars. This more severe clinical picture can also occur in patients receiving ste&#173;roids without concomitant antiparasitic therapy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-31</span>).

Other aty&#173;pi&#173;cal pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions include neuroretinitis, punctate outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxoplasmosis (PORT), unilateral pigmentary retinopathy simulating retinitis pigmentosa, and other forms of intraocular inflammation in the absence of retinochoroiditis. Characteristics of PORT include small, multifocal lesions at the level of the outer ret&#173;ina, with exudation to subret&#173;i&#173;nal space and scant overlying vitreal inflammation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-32</span>).</p>

			<p class="h3">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In most cases, toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis is clinically diagnosed on the basis of the characteristic fundus lesion. Positive serologic testing for anti–&#173;<span class="italic">T gondii</span> IgG or IgM confirms exposure to the parasite. IgG antibodies appear &#173;after the first 2 weeks of infection, typically remain detectable for life at variable levels, and cross the placenta. IgM antibodies, however, increase in number early during the acute phase of the infection, typically remain detectable for less than 1 year, and do not cross the placenta. The presence of anti–&#173;<span class="italic">T gondii</span> IgG antibodies supports the diagnosis of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis in the appropriate clinical context, whereas a negative antibody titer essentially rules out the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The presence of IgM in newborns confirms congenital infection and indicates acquired disease in adults. In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, PCR testing of aqueous humor and vitreous fluid may be performed.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-22">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular toxoplasmosis is a progressive and recurrent disease. New lesions may occur at the margins of old scars as well as elsewhere in the fundus, and toxoplasmic cysts may be pres&#173;ent in a normal-&#173;appearing ret&#173;ina. In the immunocompetent patient, the disease can have a self-&#173;limiting course. The borders of the lesions become sharper and less edematous over a 6–8-&#173;week period without treatment, and RPE hyperplasia occurs gradually over a period of months. In the immunocompromised patient, the disease is often more severe and progressive. Treatment can shorten the duration of parasitic replication, leading to more rapid cicatrization and ultimately a smaller retinochoroidal scar. Treatment may also reduce the frequency of inflammatory recurrences and minimize structural complications associated with intraocular inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Numerous medi&#173;cations may be used to treat toxoplasmosis, and &#173;there is no consensus as to the most efficacious regimen. Most antibiotic agents have efficacy against the active tachyzoite, not the tissue-&#173;encysted bradyzoite. &#173;Little firm evidence exists that antimicrobial therapy alters the natu&#173;ral history of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis in immunocompetent patients. Some clinicians may elect to observe small lesions in the ret&#173;i&#173;nal periphery that are not associated with a significant decrease in vision or vitritis; &#173;others treat virtually all patients in an effort to reduce the number of subsequent recurrences. Relative treatment indications include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">lesions threatening the optic nerve or fovea</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">decreased visual acuity</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">lesions associated with moderate to severe vitreous inflammation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">lesions greater than 1 disc dia&#173;meter in size</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">per&#173;sis&#173;tence of disease for more than 1 month</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">presence of multiple active lesions</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment is indicated in immunocompromised patients (&#173;those with HIV/AIDS, with neoplastic disease, or undergoing IMT), patients with congenital toxoplasmosis, and pregnant &#173;women with recently acquired disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The classic regimen for the treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis consists of 4–8 weeks of pyrimethamine (loading dose, 50–100&#160;mg; treatment dose, 25–50&#160;mg/day) and sulfadiazine (treatment dose, 1&#160;g, 4 times/day). Pyrimethamine has recently become prohibitively expensive. Folinic acid (5–10&#160;mg/day) is added to prevent myelosuppression (leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia), which may result from pyrimethamine therapy. A complete blood count may be checked approximately &#173;every 2 weeks during therapy. Potential adverse effects of sulfa compounds include skin rash, gastrointestinal intolerance, crystalluria, kidney stones, and Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome. Clindamycin (300&#160;mg, 4 times/day) may be added to the above regimen or substituted for sulfadiazine in the case of sulfa allergy. Clindamycin, &#173;either alone or in combination with other drugs, has been effective in managing acute lesions, but pseudomembranous colitis is a potential complication. Azithromycin (500&#160;mg daily) or atovaquone (750&#160;mg, 2–4 times/day) may take the place of sulfadiazine or clindamycin.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many ophthalmologists utilize trimethoprim-&#173;sulfamethoxazole (160&#160;mg/800&#160;mg, 2 times/day) &#173;because of its accessibility, simplicity of administration, and cost. Clindamycin (1&#160;mg/0.1&#160;mL) may also be intravitreally injected in an off-&#173;label fashion, &#173;either in combination with systemic therapy or as monotherapy in patients who do not tolerate systemic therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic corticosteroids (approximately 0.25–0.75&#160;mg/kg, typically not to exceed 60&#160;mg/day) may be considered &#173;after 48 hours of antimicrobial therapy in immunocompetent patients. The use of systemic corticosteroids without appropriate antimicrobial coverage or the use of long-&#173;acting periocular and intraocular corticosteroid formulations such as triamcinolone acetonide is contraindicated &#173;because of the potential for severe panophthalmitis and loss of the eye (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-31</span>). Topical corticosteroids, however, are used liberally in the presence of prominent anterior segment inflammation. Systemic corticosteroid treatment may be used for 3–5 weeks, at which time inflammation begins to subside and the ret&#173;i&#173;nal lesion shows signs of early cicatrization. Antimicrobial coverage should be continued for the entire period of systemic corticosteroid use.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Newborns with congenital toxoplasmosis are commonly treated with pyrimethamine and sulfonamides (plus folinic acid) for 1 year, in consultation with a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In cases of newly acquired toxoplasmosis during pregnancy, treatment is given to prevent infection of the fetus and limit fetal damage if infection has already occurred, as well as to limit the destructive sequelae of intraocular disease in the &#173;mother. Spiramycin (treatment dose, 400&#160;mg 3 times/day) reduces the rate of tachyzoite transmission to the fetus and may be used safely without undue risk of teratogenicity. &#173;Because this drug is commonly unavailable in the United States, alternative medi&#173;cations may be needed; options include azithromycin, clindamycin, and atovaquone (treatment dose, 750&#160;mg &#173;every 6 hours). Sulfonamides may be used safely in the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy. Alternatively, intravitreal injection of clindamycin and short-&#173;acting periocular corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone) may be utilized in pregnant &#173;women to reduce systemic adverse effects.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with HIV/AIDS require extended systemic treatment given the frequent association of ocular disease with ce&#173;re&#173;bral involvement (56%) and the frequency of recurrent ocular disease when antitoxoplasmic medi&#173;cation is discontinued (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-33</span>). The best regimen for secondary prophylaxis remains to be determined; however, atovaquone acts synergistically with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine and thus may be useful for reducing the dose and toxicity of &#173;these drugs in the treatment of patients with AIDS and toxoplasmosis. The management of ocular toxoplasmosis in association with HIV/AIDS is also covered in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;15</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Long-&#173;term intermittent trimethoprim-&#173;sulfamethoxazole treatment (160&#160;mg/800&#160;mg 3 times per week) was shown to decrease the risk of reactivation among patients with recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis observed over a 20-&#173;month period. A similar strategy may be useful as prophylaxis in patients with ocular toxoplasmosis and HIV/AIDS.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Similarly, the utility of prophylactic antimicrobial treatment shortly before and &#173;after intraocular surgery in patients with inactive toxoplasmic scars—&#173;particularly scars that threaten the optic disc or fovea—&#173;was raised by a report that describes an association between cataract surgery and an increased risk of reactivation of other&#173;wise inactive toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. &#173;There is, however, no consensus with re&#173;spect to this treatment approach or to the optimal antibiotic regimen in this clinical situation.</p>

			<p class="h2">Toxocariasis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular toxocariasis (OT) is a zoonotic infection caused by <span class="italic">Toxocara canis</span> and <span class="italic">Toxocara cati.</span> Dogs and cats, the definitive hosts of the roundworm, pass unembryonated eggs via their feces into the environment (often into the soil). According to the CDC, 30% of dogs younger than 6 months may deposit <span class="italic">Toxocara</span> eggs in their feces, and 25% of cats are infected with <span class="italic">Toxocara cati.</span> &#173;After 2–4 weeks, &#173;those eggs embryonate and become infectious. Transmission to &#173;humans occurs through ingestion of soil or contaminated food, or the fecal–&#173;oral route. Exposure to playgrounds, sandboxes, kittens, and puppies, as well as the pica eating disorder, are risk &#173;factors. Rarely, &#173;humans may acquire the infection from under&#173;cooked meat. NHANES data from 2011–2014 suggested an overall seroprevalence in the United States of 5.1%. In &#173;children, an increased rate of antibody positivity correlated to lack of health insurance. The prevalence was recently estimated to be 1% of a large uveitic population treated at tertiary care centers in northern California.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The organisms grow in the small intestine, enter the portal circulation, and disseminate hematogenously. In &#173;humans, the <span class="italic">Toxocara</span> larvae may migrate to dif&#173;fer&#173;ent parts of the body, including the liver, heart, lungs, brains, muscles, or eyes. The larvae do not undergo further development in the &#173;human but rather cause a local inflammatory reaction. &#173;Because ova are not shed in the gastrointestinal tract, stool analy&#173;sis for larvae is not useful.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Visceral toxocariasis (VT) may include fever, coughing, enlarged liver, pneumonia, and meningoencephalitis. It more often affects &#173;children younger than age 3, and &#173;those patients may show peripheral eosinophilia. Ocular toxocariasis is found in older &#173;children, typically without significant eosinophilia. &#173;These infections rarely pres&#173;ent si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ophthalmic pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions include a chronic endophthalmitis (25%), a posterior pole granuloma (25%; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-34</span>), or a peripheral granuloma, sometimes with fibrous bands in the vitreous that may extend posteriorly (50%; <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-35</span>). Any of &#173;these pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions may produce leukocoria. Uncommon variants include unilateral pars planitis with diffuse peripheral inflammatory exudates, granulomas involving the optic nerve, and a diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;11-2</span> lists the characteristics of each pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular toxocariasis is principally a clinical diagnosis. Serologic testing may suggest prior exposure. However, patients with OT may have negative serum serology. Antibody testing of ocular fluids may be positive despite negative serum. Polymerase chain reaction testing is not readily available. Larvae have been recovered from vitrectomy specimens (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-36</span>). In cases of media opacity, B-&#173;scan ultrasonography and/or computed tomography may show vitreous membranes and/or tractional detachment and confirm the absence of calcium, a potential finding in retinoblastoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis includes retinoblastoma, infectious endophthalmitis, Coats disease, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, per&#173;sis&#173;tent fetal vasculature, toxoplasmosis, undifferentiated intermediate uveitis/pars/planitis, retinopathy of prematurity, combined hamartoma of the ret&#173;ina and RPE, and diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN). The migrating larvae of other helminths such as <span class="italic">Baylisascaris procyonis</span> may simulate OT. In contrast to OT, &#173;children with retinoblastoma are typically younger, lack significant inflammation, and show lesion growth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with VT are usually treated with oral albendazole. For OT, the use of antihelminthic therapy is not established but may be considered if the larvae appear active. Typically, local and systemic corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and minimize structural complications, which may &#173;later be amenable to vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal surgical techniques.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-22">Cysticercosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cysticercosis is the most common ocular tapeworm infection. &#173;Human infection is caused by <span class="italic">Cysticercus cellulosae,</span> the larval stage of the cestode <span class="italic">Taenia solium,</span> which is endemic to Mexico, Africa, Southeast Asia, eastern Eu&#173;rope, Central and South Amer&#173;i&#173;ca, and India. &#173;Humans acquire the disease via fecal-&#173;oral transmission or consuming undercooked infected pork. The eggs mature into larvae, penetrate the intestinal mucosa, and spread hematogenously to the eye via the posterior ciliary arteries into the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular cysticercosis usually affects individuals between the ages of 10 and 30&#160;years, without sex predilection. Cysticercosis may involve any structure of the eye, orbit, or adnexa, but involves the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space most often (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-37</span>). Larvae may perforate the ret&#173;ina, gaining access to the vitreous cavity (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-38</span>). Other pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions include a subconjunctival or eyelid nodule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients may be asymptomatic with relatively good vision or may complain of floaters, moving sensations, ocular pain, photophobia, redness, and very poor visual acuity. Larvae may be observed in the vitreous or subret&#173;i&#173;nal space in up to 46% of infected patients. A globular translucent cyst is seen, with an invaginated or evaginated head, or scolex, that undulates in response to the examining light (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 11-38, 11-39</span>). Exudative, rhegmatogenous, or tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment may be observed. Computed tomography may reveal intrace&#173;re&#173;bral calcification or hydrocephalus in patients with neural cysticercosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis includes conditions associated with leukocoria (retinoblastoma, Coats disease, retinopathy of prematurity, per&#173;sis&#173;tent fetal vasculature, toxocariasis, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment) and DUSN.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Larvae death provokes panuveitis. &#173;Laser photocoagulation alone may also provoke severe inflammation. Hence, early removal of intraocular larvae, often with vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal surgical techniques, is advocated. Antihelminthics plus systemic corticosteroids may be utilized for extraocular disease.</p>

			<p class="h2">Diffuse Unilateral Subacute Neuroretinitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis is an uncommon but impor&#173;tant disease likely caused by nematode infection. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of posterior uveitis occurring among other&#173;wise healthy, young patients (mean age, 14&#160;years; range, 11–65&#160;years) &#173;because early recognition and prompt treatment may preserve vision. Evidence to date suggests that DUSN is caused by solitary nematodes of 2 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent sizes, apparently related to geographic region, that migrate through the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space. The smaller worm, mea&#173;sur&#173;ing 400–1000 µm in length, has been proposed to be &#173;either <span class="italic">Ancylostoma caninum</span> (the dog hookworm) or <span class="italic">Toxocara canis</span>, though the latter has never been reported to be isolated from an eye with DUSN. The larger worm is believed to be <span class="italic">Baylisascaris procyonis</span> (the raccoon roundworm), which mea&#173;sures 1500–2000 µm in length and has been found in the northern midwestern United States and Canada. The disease has also been reported outside North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical course of DUSN is characterized by the insidious onset of unilateral loss of vision from recurrent episodes of focal, multifocal, or diffuse inflammation of the ret&#173;ina, RPE, and optic nerve. The early stages of the disease are marked by moderate to severe vitritis; optic disc swelling; and multiple, focal, gray-&#173;white lesions in the postequatorial fundus that vary in size from 1200 µm to 1500 µm (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-40</span>). &#173;These lesions are transient and may be associated with overlying exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. The worms may be visualized in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space, especially in the early stages. Differential diagnosis at this phase of the disease includes sarcoidosis-&#173;associated uveitis, MCP, acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, serpiginous choroidopathy, Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease, toxocariasis, OHS, nonspecific optic neuritis, and papillitis. The &#173;later disease stages are typified by ret&#173;i&#173;nal arteriolar narrowing, optic atrophy, diffuse pigment epithelial degeneration, and abnormal electroretinographic results (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-41)</span>. &#173;These findings may be confused with posttraumatic chorioretinopathy, occlusive vascular disease, toxic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. Although highly unusual, bilateral cases have been reported, as have cases of DUSN associated with neurologic disease (neural larvae migrans).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis is made according to the aforementioned clinical picture and is most strongly supported by the observation of a worm in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space (Video 11-1). Results of systemic and laboratory evaluations are typically negative for patients with DUSN. Electroretinographic abnormalities may be pres&#173;ent even when the test is performed early in the disease course.</p>

			<p class="body-text">Medical therapy alone with corticosteroids may only transiently control inflammation. Direct &#173;laser photocoagulation of the worm in the early phases of the disease does not appear inflammatory and may be highly effective in halting progression of the disease (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-38</span>). Successful treatment and immobilization of the subret&#173;i&#173;nal worm have been reported with oral thiabendazole (22&#160;mg/kg twice daily for 2–4 days with a maximum dose of 3&#160;g) and albendazole (200&#160;mg twice daily for 30 days), which may be a better-&#173;tolerated alternative. Thus, if the worm cannot be visualized, patients may undergo a course of antihelminthic therapy to increase the chance of identifying and treating the nematode. In patients who undergo &#173;laser and inflammation does not improve, antihelminthic therapy may treat a presumed second unvisualized nematode.</p>

			<p class="h2">Onchocerciasis (River Blindness)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Humans are the only host for <span class="italic">Onchocerca volvulus</span> parasite. As the vector, female black flies that breed near rivers bite an infected &#173;human and ingest microfilariae. The infective larvae are then transmitted to another &#173;human with a &#173;future bite. Onchocerciasis is endemic in many areas of sub-&#173;Saharan Africa and in isolated foci in Central and South Amer&#173;i&#173;ca. Worldwide, at least 25 million &#173;people are infected, of whom almost 300,000 are blind and 800,000 are visually impaired. Microfilariae prob&#173;ably reach the eye by vari&#173;ous routes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">direct invasion of the cornea from the conjunctiva</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">penetration of the sclera, both directly and through the vascular bundles</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">hematogenous spread (possibly)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Microfilariae can be observed swimming freely in the anterior chamber. Live microfilariae can be seen in the cornea; dead microfilariae cause a small stromal punctate keratitis. Anterior uveitis may lead to synechiae, secondary glaucoma, and cataract. In the posterior segment, RPE disruption and focal atrophy may occur. &#173;Later, severe chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy develops. Optic atrophy is common in advanced disease (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-42</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnosis is based on clinical appearance and a history of pathogen exposure in an endemic area and confirmed by finding microfilariae in small skin biopsies or in the eye. Ivermectin, the treatment of choice, is given &#173;every 3–6 months as long as &#173;there is evidence of skin or eye infection. Topical corticosteroids can be used to control any anterior uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ivermectin safely kills the microfilariae but does not have a permanent effect on the adult worms. Concomitant doxycycline therapy helps kill the adult worms by eradicating the symbiotic partner—<span class="italic">Wolbachia</span> bacteria. Lastly, patients coinfected with onchocerciasis and <span class="italic">Loa loa</span> are at risk of a fatal encephalitic reaction to ivermectin, so infectious disease consultation should be procured for such individuals.</p>
