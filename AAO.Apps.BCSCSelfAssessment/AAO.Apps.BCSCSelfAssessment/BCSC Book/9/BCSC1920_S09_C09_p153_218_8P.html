			<div id="Chapt9_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Posterior uveitis is defined by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature classification system as intraocular inflammation that involves primarily the ret&#173;ina and/or choroid. Inflammatory cells may be observed diffusely throughout the vitreous cavity, adjacent to foci of active inflammation, or on the posterior vitreous face. The presence of posterior segment structural complications—&#173;such as macular edema, peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, optic disc edema, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal or choroidal neovascularization—is not considered when determining &#173;whether a patient has posterior uveitis. For instance, the presence of macular edema as part of HLA-&#173;B27–&#173;associated anterior uveitis does not mean that the patient also has posterior uveitis. Noninfectious syndromes with primarily posterior segment involvement are included in this section; diagnoses routinely producing both anterior and posterior segment involvement are addressed in the Panuveitis section &#173;later in the chapter.</p>

			<p class="h3-h2">Systemic lupus erythematosus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem connective tissue disorder that affects primarily &#173;women of childbearing age, with higher incidence rates among African American and Hispanic persons in the United States. The pathogenesis of SLE is incompletely understood. It is thought to be an autoimmune disorder characterized by B-&#173;lymphocyte hyperactivity, polyclonal B-&#173;lymphocyte activation, hypergammaglobulinemia, autoantibody formation, and T-&#173;lymphocyte autoreactivity with immune complex deposition, leading to end-&#173;organ damage. Autoantibodies associated with SLE include antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antibodies to both single-&#173; and double-&#173;stranded DNA (anti-&#173;ssDNA and anti-&#173;dsDNA), antibodies to cytoplasmic components (anti-&#173;Sm, anti-&#173;Ro, and anti-&#173;La), and antiphospholipid antibodies.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations </span>The systemic manifestations of SLE include acute cutaneous diseases in approximately 70%–80% of patients (malar rash, discoid lupus, photosensitivity, and mucosal lesions), arthritis in 80%–85%, renal disease in 50%–75%, Raynaud phenomenon in 30%–50%, and neurologic involvement in 35%. Cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, and &#173;hematologic abnormalities can also occur. The diagnosis is clinical and based on criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular manifestations occur in 50% of patients with SLE and include cutaneous lesions on the eyelids (discoid lupus erythematosus), secondary Sj<span class="accent">ö</span>gren syndrome, scleritis, cranial nerve palsies, optic neuropathy, ret&#173;i&#173;nal and choroidal vasculopathy, and, in rare cases, uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lupus retinopathy, the most well-&#173;recognized posterior segment manifestation, is considered an impor&#173;tant marker of systemic disease activity. Prevalence ranges from 3% among patients with mild disease to 29% among &#173;those with more active disease. Its clinical spectrum varies and is characterized by the following signs:</p>

More severe ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular occlusive disease in SLE appears to be associated with central ner&#173;vous system (CNS) lupus and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular thrombosis is thought to be related to a hypercoagulable state induced by autoantibodies, rather than to an inflammatory ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis.

				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-10"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Lupus choroidopathy.</span> This entity is characterized by an immune-&#173;mediated choroidal vasculopathy, causing serous elevations of the ret&#173;ina and/or ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE), as well as choroidal infarction and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). It almost always occurs in patients with known, and usually severe, systemic vascular disease, due to &#173;either hypertension from lupus nephritis or systemic vasculitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-3</span>).

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-11"><span class="h4-head">Limits to ANA testing</span> Uveitis is not commonly associated with SLE. However, ANA testing is often done in patients with uveitis who have no systemic or ocular findings to suggest SLE. &#173;Under &#173;those circumstances, the test has a very high false-&#173;positive rate; ANA testing should be limited to use in patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of SLE or who have juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), for whom the test can help determine the level of risk for uveitis.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-11"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> The treatment of ophthalmic disease in SLE is directed &#173;toward control of the under&#173;lying systemic disease, which may involve corticosteroids and IMT (immunomodulatory therapy), including hydroxychloroquine. Patients with severe vaso-&#173;occlusive disease or antiphospholipid antibodies may benefit from antiplatelet therapy or systemic anticoagulation. Ischemic complications, including proliferative retinopathy and vitreous hemorrhage, are managed with panret&#173;i&#173;nal photocoagulation, intravitreal anti-&#173;vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF) injections, and, in some cases, vitrectomy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some patients with SLE may remain on glucocorticoids for extended periods and thus need monitoring for cataracts and glaucoma. In addition, patients taking hydroxychloroquine should be informed about the ophthalmic risks and the need for regular ophthalmic examinations to screen for ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxicity.

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Polyarteritis nodosa</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is an uncommon systemic vasculitis characterized by subacute or chronic, focal, necrotizing inflammation of medium-&#173;sized and small arteries. The disease pres&#173;ents in patients between the ages of 40 and 60&#160;years and affects men 3 times more frequently than &#173;women; the annual incidence rate is approximately 0.7 per 100,000 individuals. Although &#173;there are no racial or geographic predisposing &#173;factors, 10% of patients test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, implicating hepatitis B as an etiologic agent. Indeed, the demonstration of circulating immune complexes composed of hepatitis B antigen and antibodies to hepatitis B in vessel walls during the early stages of the disease strongly implicates immune-&#173;complex–&#173;mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of PAN.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-11"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> PAN most commonly affects skin, nerves, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. Fatigue, fever, weight loss, and arthralgia are pres&#173;ent in up to 75% of patients. Vasculitis-&#173;induced peripheral neuropathies are also common, as are skin manifestations, which include subcutaneous nodules, purpura, livedo reticularis, and Raynaud phenomenon. Renal involvement often manifests as secondary hypertension and affects approximately one-&#173;third of patients. Gastrointestinal disease with small-&#173;bowel ischemia and infarction occurs less frequently but may lead to serious complications. Other systemic manifestations include coronary arteritis, pericarditis, and hematologic abnormalities. CNS disease associated with PAN is rare. The American College of Rheumatology has developed specific criteria for the diagnosis of PAN.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular involvement is pres&#173;ent in up to 20% of patients with PAN and arises &#173;because of the under&#173;lying vascular disease. Posterior pole manifestations include hypertensive retinopathy, characterized by macular star formation, cotton-&#173;wool spots, intraret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages, ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusions, and choroidal infarcts. Patients may have a ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-4</span>) or a vasculitis involving the posterior ciliary arteries and choroidal vessels, with resultant exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments. Elschnig spots—&#173;focal areas of choroidal hyperpigmentation surrounded by hypopigmentation—&#173;may be observed in the posterior pole &#173;because of lobular choroidal ischemia and infarcts (see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous</span>). Neuro-&#173;ophthalmic manifestations include cranial nerve palsies, amaurosis fugax, homonymous hemianopia, Horner syndrome, and optic atrophy. Scleral inflammatory disease of all types, including necrotizing and posterior scleritis, has been reported. Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK), typically accompanied by scleritis, may be the presenting manifestation of PAN.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treatment and prognosis</span> Unlike granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; previously known as <span class="h4-text_italic">Wegener granulomatosis</span>), polyarteritis nodosa is not associated with antineutrophil &#173;cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). The 5-&#173;year mortality rate of untreated PAN is 90%. Although systemic corticosteroid use may reduce this rate to 50%, combination therapy with IMT, such as cyclophosphamide, improves 5-&#173;year survival to 80% and may induce long-&#173;term remission of the disease. It is therefore impor&#173;tant to consider PAN in the differential diagnosis of ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis presenting in patients in whom an under&#173;lying necrotizing vasculitis is suspected; appropriate diagnosis and management can be life-&#173;saving. Tissue biopsy confirms the diagnosis.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Granulomatosis with polyangiitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a multisystem autoimmune disorder characterized by the classic triad of necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tract, focal segmental glomerulonephritis, and necrotizing vasculitis of small arteries and veins. Involvement of the paranasal sinuses is the most characteristic clinical feature of this disorder, followed by pulmonary and renal disease. Renal involvement may or may not be evident at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, but its early detection is impor&#173;tant, as glomerulonephritis develops in up to 85% of patients during the course of the disease and carries significant mortality if left untreated. A limited form of this disease has been described, consisting of granulomatous inflammation involving the respiratory tract without overt involvement of the kidneys.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another entity believed to belong to the GPA spectrum is microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Patients with MPA may have clinical features similar to &#173;those of GPA but lack granulomatous changes on biopsy. Patients with MPA are also more likely to have ANCA directed at myeloperoxidase (MPO; discussed further shortly). &#173;There is some controversy in the rheumatologic lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture about differentiating the 2 entities; however, ophthalmic involvement is much less common in MPA.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-12"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> Patients with GPA may pres&#173;ent with sinusitis associated with bloody nasal discharge, pulmonary symptomatology, and arthritis. Dermatologic involvement is pres&#173;ent in approximately one-&#173;half of patients, with purpura involving the lower extremities occurring most frequently; less common are ulcers and subcutaneous nodules. Ner&#173;vous system involvement may occur in approximately one-&#173;third of patients. Mononeuritis multiplex is the most common, but cranial neuropathies, seizures, stroke syndromes, and ce&#173;re&#173;bral vasculitis may also occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular or orbital involvement is found in 15% of patients at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion and in up to 50% of patients during the course of the disease. Orbital involvement is usually secondary to contiguous extension of the granulomatous inflammatory pro&#173;cess from the paranasal sinuses into the orbit. Orbital cellulitis and dacryocystitis may arise from the involved and secondarily infected nasal mucosa. Orbital pseudotumor, distinct from the&#160;sinus inflammation, may also occur. Scleritis of any type, particularly diffuse anterior or necrotizing disease, with or without peripheral ulcerative keratitis, affects up to 40% of patients. Posterior scleritis has been reported.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Approximately 10% of patients with GPA and ocular involvement have been reported to have an associated nonspecific, unilateral or bilateral anterior, intermediate, or posterior uveitis, with varying degrees of vitritis. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal involvement is relatively uncommon, occurring in up to 10% of patients. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular manifestations range from relatively benign cotton-&#173;wool spots, with or without associated intraret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages, to more severe vaso-&#173;occlusive disease, including branch or central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery or vein occlusion. Retinitis has been reported in up to 20% of patients; &#173;those with accompanying ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis may develop ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, and neovascular glaucoma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-5</span>). Orbital involvement can lead to compressive ischemic optic neuropathy. Vision loss in GPA may occur in up to 40% of patients, especially among &#173;those with long-&#173;standing or inadequately treated disease.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Diagnosis</span> Tissue biopsy establishes the histologic diagnosis; chest radiograph may disclose nodular, diffuse, or cavitary lesions; and laboratory evaluation may reveal proteinuria or hematuria, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-&#173;reactive protein levels, as well as the presence of ANCA. ANCA are antibodies directed against cytoplasmic azurophilic granules of neutrophils and monocytes that are specific markers for a group of related systemic vasculitides, including GPA, MPA, eosinophilic GPA (Churg-&#173;Strauss syndrome), renal-&#173;limited vasculitis, and pauci-&#173;immunoglomerulonephritis. Two main classes of ANCA have been described according to their immunofluorescence staining patterns:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">The cytoplasmic, or c-&#173;ANCA, pattern is both sensitive to and specific for GPA and is pres&#173;ent in up to 95% of patients; proteinase 3 is the most common target antigen (referred to as PR3-&#173;ANCA).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">The perinuclear, or p-&#173;ANCA, pattern is associated with MPA, renal-&#173;limited vasculitis, and pauci-&#173;immunoglomerulonephritis.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Myeloperoxidase is the most common antigenic target (MPO-&#173;ANCA). Standardized testing for ANCA should include both immunofluorescence testing for c-&#173; and p-&#173;ANCA and specific antibody testing for PR3-&#173;ANCA and MPO-&#173;ANCA; the latter 2 are most specific.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> Appropriate treatment of GPA mandates combination therapy with oral corticosteroids and IMT, such as rituximab and cyclophosphamide. Without therapy, the 1-&#173;year mortality rate is 80%. However, 93% of patients treated with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids successfully achieve remission with resolution of eye disease. The ophthalmologist’s role in recognizing GPA-&#173;associated eye disease can be critical, since timely diagnosis and treatment are essential in reducing not only ocular morbidity but also patient mortality.</p>
			<p class="h2">Susac Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Susac syndrome (also known as <span class="italic">SICRET syndrome,</span> for <span class="italic">s</span>mall <span class="italic">i</span>nfarctions of <span class="italic">c</span>ochlear, <span class="italic">r</span>etinal, and <span class="italic">e</span>ncephalic <span class="italic">t</span>issue) is a rare entity, initially reported in 1979 by Susac and colleagues. The clinically observed triad consists of encephalopathy, hearing loss, and branch ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusions (BRAO). The syndrome occurs mostly in young &#173;women but has been noted in patients aged 16–58&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="h3">Manifestations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The differential diagnosis at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion includes multiple sclerosis, herpetic encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease; however, ocular findings are highly specific and may aid in diagnosis. Ophthalmoscopy shows diffuse or localized narrowing of ret&#173;i&#173;nal arteries with a “boxcar” segmentation of the blood column at the level of peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal arteries (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-6A</span>). Vitreous haze or cells are absent. Angiography demonstrates focal nonperfused ret&#173;i&#173;nal arterioles with hyperfluorescent walls (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-6B</span>). &#173;There is usually no evidence of embolic material or inflammatory reactions around the vessels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another useful diagnostic tool and shows multifocal supratentorial white &#173;matter lesions; the corpus callosum may be involved. Audiometry should be performed in any patient being evaluated for this entity; sensorineural hearing loss is a common finding.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> Treatment remains controversial and includes high-&#173;dose intravenous corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and IMT, such as intravenous immunoglobulin and mycophenolate mofetil. The course of Susac syndrome is not always self-&#173;limiting, and isolated ret&#173;i&#173;nal arteriolar involvement may occur as a very late manifestation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Inflammatory Chorioretinopathies of Unknown Etiology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The inflammatory chorioretinopathies, or white dot syndromes, are a heterogeneous group of inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical features that share the presence of discrete, multiple, well-&#173;circumscribed, yellow-&#173;white lesions at the level of the ret&#173;ina, outer ret&#173;ina, RPE, choriocapillaris, and/or choroid during some phase of their course. The white dot syndromes consist of the predominantly noninfectious ocular syndromes listed in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;9-1</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Their differential diagnosis includes systemic and ocular infectious entities such as syphilis, diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN), and ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (OHS), as well as noninfectious entities such as sarcoidosis, sympathetic ophthalmia, Vogt-&#173;Koyanagi-&#173;Harada (VKH) syndrome, and intraocular lymphoma. Common presenting symptoms include photopsias, blurred vision, nyctalopia, floaters, and visual field loss contiguous with the blind spot. In many cases, a prodromal viral syndrome can be identified. Bilateral involvement, albeit asymmetrically (with the exception of multiple evanescent white dot syndrome [MEWDS]), is the rule. Excepting patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy or serpiginous choroiditis, most individuals are younger than 50&#160;years of age. A female predominance is observed in patients with MEWDS, birdshot chorioretinopathy, multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis, punctate inner choroiditis (PIC), subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis and uveitis syndrome, and acute zonal occult outer retinopathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The etiology of the white dot syndromes is unknown. Some investigators have postulated an infectious cause; &#173;others have suggested an autoimmune/inflammatory pathogenesis arising in individuals with common non–&#173;disease-&#173;specific ge&#173;ne&#173;tics, triggered by some exogenous agent. An increased prevalence of systemic autoimmune disease, both in patients with white dot syndromes and in their first-&#173; and second-&#173;degree relatives, suggests that inflammatory chorioretinopathies may occur in families with inherited immune dysregulation that predisposes to autoimmunity. It is also unclear &#173;whether the white dot syndromes represent a clinical spectrum of a single disease entity or are discrete diseases. Although they share common features, the white dot syndromes can be differentiated by their variable lesion morphology and evolution, distinct natu&#173;ral histories, and appearance with multimodal imaging. This differentiation has impor&#173;tant implications with re&#173;spect to disease-&#173;specific treatments and visual prognosis.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Birdshot chorioretinopathy (also known as <span class="italic">birdshot uveitis, birdshot retinochoroidopathy,</span> and <span class="italic">vitiliginous chorioretinitis</span>) is an uncommon disease presenting predominantly in white &#173;women of northern Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean descent past the fourth de&#173;cade of life. Although no consistent systemic disease association has been identified, birdshot chorioretinopathy is highly correlated with the HLA-&#173;A29 gene, with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 93%. The presence of the haplotype confers considerably increased relative risk (224-&#173;fold) for the development of this disease. HLA-&#173;A29 is confirmatory rather than diagnostic, as 7% of the general population carries this haplotype, and in the absence of characteristic clinical features, an alternative diagnosis should be considered.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-15"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> Presenting symptoms include blurred vision, floaters, nyctalopia, and disturbance of color vision. Visual complaints may be out of proportion to the mea&#173;sured Snellen visual acuity, reflecting the diffuse ret&#173;i&#173;nal dysfunction that occurs in this disease. Patients may also report unusual peripheral visual phenomena, such as pinwheels, sparkles, or flickering lights, and &#173;these symptoms may be indicators of subtle disease activity. Anterior segment inflammation may be minimal or absent; however, varying degrees of vitritis are commonly noted.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Funduscopy reveals characteristic multifocal, hypopigmented, ovoid, cream-&#173;colored lesions (50–1500 µm) at the level of the choroid and RPE in the postequatorial fundus. Typically, &#173;these lesions show a nasal and radial distribution, emanating from the optic nerve, and frequently they follow the under&#173;lying choroidal vessels (Fig<span class="xref-figure"> 9-7</span>). The lesions do not become pigmented over time and are best appreciated by indirect ophthalmoscopy, although they may not be readily apparent at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, uveitic macular edema, and optic nerve head inflammation are impor&#173;tant components of active disease. Late complications include optic atrophy, epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane (ERM) formation, and, rarely, CNV.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fluorescein angiography (FA) findings are variable, depending on duration of disease and clinical activity. Although early birdshot chorioretinopathy lesions may show initial hypofluorescence with subtle late staining, in general, FA is more useful in identifying more subtle indices of active inflammation, such as ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, macular edema, and optic nerve head leakage (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-8</span>). Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography discloses multiple hypocyanescent spots, which are typically more numerous than &#173;those apparent on clinical examination or FA (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-9</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging reveals hypoautofluorescence in areas of RPE atrophy that are more numerous and not uniformly correspondent with lesions on examination, suggesting that the choroid and RPE may be affected in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dently &#173;(<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;9-10</span>). Macular hypoautofluorescence has been associated with vision loss and disease severity. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) may show macular edema or demonstrate patchy or diffuse loss of photoreceptors (inner/outer segment line or ellipsoid zone) and macular atrophy, especially with long-&#173;standing disease (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-11</span>). Enhanced-&#173;depth OCT imaging may be useful to evaluate choroidal thickening early in the disease course and thinning in advanced disease.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Differential diagnosis</span> Impor&#173;tant differential diagnostic considerations include pars planitis, VKH syndrome, sympathetic ophthalmia, OHS, intraocular lymphoma, and especially sarcoidosis, which may pres&#173;ent with chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions of similar morphology and distribution as &#173;those pres&#173;ent in birdshot chorioretinopathy.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Disease course</span> Birdshot chorioretinopathy can be insidious, and simply monitoring visual acuity and clinical examination findings is insufficient to protect patients from vision loss. Progressive worsening of the visual field and abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) results are commonly found with extended follow-up. This suggests a more diffuse ret&#173;i&#173;nal dysfunction not fully explained by the presence of uveitic macular edema or other structural abnormality. For this reason, full-&#173;field ERGs (with attention to the 30-&#173;Hz flicker implicit time and scotopic b-&#173;wave amplitudes) and Goldmann and automated visual field (30-2 with attention to the mean deviation) testing are more useful par&#173;ameters for monitoring disease course and response to therapy than are changes in funduscopic examination or visual acuity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A small subset of patients with birdshot chorioretinopathy may have self-&#173;limited disease and do well without treatment. However, &#173;there is no way to determine which patients &#173;will have disease progression, so close monitoring with the testing modalities discussed earlier is critical. Studies have shown that early and aggressive control of inflammation in this disease results in better visual outcomes.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> Treatment consists of the initial administration of systemic and/or local corticosteroids, with early introduction of corticosteroid-&#173;sparing IMT. Birdshot chorioretinopathy is typically incompletely responsive to corticosteroid monotherapy. Extended IMT is anticipated in most patients, given the chronic nature of the disease. Treatment with IMT may include cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate, and tumor necrosis factor <span class="symbol">α</span> (TNF-<span class="symbol">α</span>) inhibitors. This approach is effective in reducing intraocular inflammation, inflammatory recurrences, and the risk of developing uveitic macular edema, as well as in preserving visual acuity and visual field. Periocular or intravitreal corticosteroid injections are useful as adjunctive therapy in managing macular edema and inflammatory recurrences. The intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide implant is an option for patients who cannot tolerate systemic therapy, or in whom systemic therapy is insufficient, although multiple implants may be necessary to maintain inflammation control over time.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-16">Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy </p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) is an uncommon condition presenting in other&#173;wise healthy young adults, affecting men and &#173;women equally. It may be associated with an influenza-&#173;like illness (50%) and may have a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic predisposition, given the association of HLA-&#173;B7 and HLA-&#173;DR2 with this entity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several noninfectious systemic conditions have been reported in connection with APMPPE, including erythema nodosum, GPA, PAN, ce&#173;re&#173;bral vasculitis, scleritis and episcleritis, sarcoidosis, and ulcerative colitis. Infectious etiologies, including group A streptococcus, adenovirus type 5, tuberculosis, Lyme disease, and mumps virus have also been associated with APMPPE, as has hepatitis B vaccination. It has been postulated that APMPPE is an immune-&#173;driven vasculitis. Of greatest concern is the rare but potentially life-&#173;threatening association of APMPPE with ce&#173;re&#173;bral vasculitis. Patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of CNS disease should undergo urgent neurologic evaluation.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> Patients typically pres&#173;ent with a sudden onset of unilateral vision loss associated with central and paracentral scotomata; the fellow eye becomes involved within days to weeks. Photopsias may precede loss of vision. &#173;There is minimal or no anterior segment inflammation; vitritis may be pres&#173;ent but is usually mild. Funduscopic examination demonstrates multiple large, flat, yellow-&#173;white placoid lesions at the level of the RPE. The lesions vary in size from 1 to 2 disc areas and are scattered throughout the posterior pole (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-12)</span>. New peripheral lesions may appear in a linear or radial array over the next few weeks. Papillitis may be observed, but macular edema is uncommon. Aty&#173;pi&#173;cal findings include ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular occlusive disease, ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization, and exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. The lesions resolve over a period of 2–6 weeks, leaving a permanent, well-&#173;defined alteration in the RPE, consisting of alternating areas of depigmentation and pigment clumping. Rapid evolution of the pigmentary changes, often over days, is a typical feature of the disease.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Diagnosis</span> The diagnosis of APMPPE is based on the characteristic clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion and FA findings during the acute phase of the disease: early hypofluorescent lesions &#173;(<span class="xref-figure">Fig </span><span class="xref-figure">9-13A</span>) corresponding to, but typically more numerous than, &#173;those apparent on funduscopy and late hyperfluorescent staining (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-13B</span>). Subacute lesions may show increased central hyperfluorescence with late staining; with resolution, transmission defects are typically observed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Indocyanine green angiography reveals choroidal hypocyanescence with hypervisu&#173;alization of the under&#173;lying choroidal vessels in both the acute and inactive stages of the disease; &#173;these lesions become smaller in the inactive stages (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-14</span>). Choroidal perfusion abnormalities revealed early on FA and ICG angiography are more numerous than the overlying placoid lesions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Abnormalities noted on FAF imaging lag the clinical appearance of &#173;these lesions and are fewer in number. Typically, lesions are initially hyperautofluorescent and may evolve into areas of hypoautofluorescence over time (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-15</span>). RPE alterations observed during recovery appear well &#173;after the choroid is affected.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It remains controversial &#173;whether the lesions of APMPPE are due primarily to involvement of the RPE or represent choroidal/choriocapillary perfusion abnormalities with secondary involvement of the RPE and photoreceptors; however, taken together, the FA, ICG, and FAF imaging findings suggest a primary choroidal pro&#173;cess. OCT of acute lesions demonstrates hyperreflectivity of the outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal layers; subret&#173;i&#173;nal or intraret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid may also be pres&#173;ent (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-16</span>). As the lesions resolve, outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal and photoreceptor loss may be observed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An impor&#173;tant differential diagnostic consideration—in addition to choroidal metastasis, viral retinitis, sarcoidosis, VKH syndrome, and pneumocystis choroiditis—is serpiginous choroiditis. APMPPE is an acute, usually nonrecurring disease, whereas serpiginous choroiditis is insidious and progressive.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Prognosis</span> In most patients with APMPPE, visual acuity returns to 20/40 or better within 6 months, although 20% are left with residual visual dysfunction. Risk &#173;factors for loss of vision include foveal involvement at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, older age at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, unilateral disease, a longer interval between initial and fellow eye involvement, and recurrence. No convincing data suggest that treatment with systemic corticosteroids is beneficial in altering the visual outcome, although some authorities advocate such treatment in patients presenting with extensive macular involvement in an effort to limit subsequent RPE derangement of the foveal center. Systemic corticosteroids are also indicated in individuals with an associated CNS vasculitis.</p>

Men or &#173;women between the second and sixth de&#173;cades of life pres&#173;ent with floaters, photopsias, paracentral scotomata, and decreased vision, as well as variable degrees of anterior segment inflammation and vitritis. The acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions are similar to &#173;those of APMPPE or serpiginous choroiditis, both clinically and angiographically, but the clinical course is aty&#173;pi&#173;cal for both entities. Patients have numerous posterior and peripheral lesions predating or occurring si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously with macular involvement (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-17</span>). Acute lesions heal over a period of weeks, with resultant chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy. Older pigmented areas are observed together with new, active, white placoid lesions that are not necessarily extensions of previous areas of activity. Prolonged periods of disease activity occur, with the appearance of numerous (<span class="h4-text_symbol">&gt;</span>50) multifocal lesions scattered throughout the fundus. Relapses are common, and new lesions may appear and pro&#173;gress for up to 2&#160;years &#173;after the initial pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Serpiginous choroiditis, also known as <span class="italic">geographic</span> or <span class="italic">helicoid choroidopathy,</span> is an uncommon, chronic, progressive inflammatory condition affecting adult men and &#173;women equally in the second to seventh de&#173;cades of life. Its etiology is unknown, but it is thought to represent an immune-&#173;mediated occlusive vasculitis. With the exception of tuberculosis, which can cause a serpiginous-&#173;like choroidopathy, no other infectious organisms have been definitively implicated in this disease. Serpiginous choroiditis has been reported to occur in patients with Crohn disease, sarcoidosis, and PAN, but no consistent systemic disease associations have been identified.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-17"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> Patients pres&#173;ent with painless, paracentral scotomata and decreased vision, with minimal vitreous involvement and a quiet anterior chamber. Although patients may pres&#173;ent with unilateral symptoms, funduscopy usually reveals asymmetric bilateral scarring. Active areas appear as gray-&#173;white lesions at the level of the RPE that proj&#173;ect in a pseudopodial or geographic manner from the optic nerve in the posterior fundus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-18)</span>. Far less commonly, macular or peripheral lesions may pres&#173;ent without peripapillary involvement. Disease activity is typically confined to the leading edge of the advancing lesion and may be associated with shallow subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid. Occasionally, vascular sheathing has been reported along with RPE detachment and neovascularization of the disc. Late findings include atrophy of the choriocapillaris, RPE, and ret&#173;ina, with extensive RPE hyperpigmentation and subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis. CNV may occur at the border of an old scar in up to 25% of patients.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Disease course</span> The disease course is marked by progressive centrifugal extension, with marked asymmetry between the 2 eyes. New lesions and recurrent attacks are typical; up to 38% of affected eyes deteriorate to a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Fluorescein angiography may show blockage of the choroidal flush in the early phase and staining of the active edge of the lesion in the &#173;later stage of the angiogram (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-19</span>). In contrast, early hyperfluorescence with late leakage is indicative of the presence of CNV. Indocyanine green angiography reveals hypocyanescence throughout all phases of both acute and old lesions. It may reveal more extensive involvement than FA or clinical examination and may be useful in distinguishing active new serpiginous lesions, which are hypofluorescent, from CNV, which may appear as localized areas of hyperfluorescence during the &#173;middle to late phases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fundus autofluorescence imaging may be an exquisitely sensitive modality for detecting damage to the RPE and monitoring the clinical course of serpiginous choroiditis. Characteristic hypoautofluorescence corresponds closely to areas of regressed disease activity, and hyperfluorescence highlights areas of active disease (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-20A</span>). OCT can show increased outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal reflectivity and disruption and thickening of the under&#173;lying choroid in active disease (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-20B</span>), and atrophic changes in the ret&#173;ina and RPE in quiescent areas.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> Given the small number of patients with serpiginous choroiditis, no consensus has evolved regarding the optimal treatment regimen or its efficacy. Treatments include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Systemic, periocular, and intravitreal corticosteroids may be used in the treatment of active lesions, particularly lesions threatening the fovea.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The addition of systemic IMT at the outset has been suggested, as corticosteroids alone are typically insufficient, and patients require prolonged anti-&#173;inflammatory therapy.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Combination therapy with an antimetabolite and a T-cell inhibitor may be effective.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Cytotoxic therapy with cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil has been shown to induce long, drug-&#173;free remissions.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Intravitreal ste&#173;roid implants, including the fluocinolone acetonide and dexamethasone implants, may be used in patients intolerant of systemic therapy.</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">It is impor&#173;tant to distinguish presumed immune-&#173;mediated serpiginous choroiditis from infectious entities that can simulate the disease. Although herpetic and syphilitic choroiditis can occasionally mimic serpiginous choroiditis, much more commonly, <span class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span> can cause inflammation in a pattern that simulates typical serpiginous choroiditis. Tuberculosis (TB)-&#173;associated disease has been called <span class="italic">multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis</span> or <span class="italic">serpiginous-&#173;like choroiditis</span> (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with serpiginous-&#173;like choroiditis tend to be from countries where TB is endemic or have been exposed to active pulmonary TB. In such cases, results of tuberculin skin testing and the interferon-&#173;gamma release assay are usually positive for TB, although the chest x-ray often appears normal. The ocular involvement in TB-&#173;related serpiginous-&#173;like choroiditis is mostly unilateral, with serpiginoid lesions involving the posterior pole, midperiphery, and periphery but usually sparing the juxtapapillary area &#173;until late in the disease. The lesions tend to appear and pro&#173;gress in multiple areas rather than to spread out centrifugally as they do in serpiginous choroiditis. Patients with serpiginous-&#173;like choroiditis exhibit a more prominent inflammatory cellular reaction in the vitreous than do patients with serpiginous choroiditis. The disease usually responds to anti-&#173;TB treatment, although complete control may take months and corticosteroids may also be needed to control inflammation.

When the disorders are considered a continuum, the term <span class="italic">multifocal choroiditis</span> may be used to describe all the entities, and the presence of fibrosis or panuveitis is then described separately. For this discussion, the traditional nomenclature is used to discuss the three related diseases as discrete entities.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> MCP is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder affecting the choroid, ret&#173;ina, and vitreous. It pres&#173;ents asymmetrically, most often in young &#173;women with myopia. Symptoms include floaters, photopsias, enlargement of the physiologic blind spot, and decreased vision. The ophthalmoscopic hallmarks include the presence of multiple old, atrophic lesions that appear as punched-&#173;out, white-&#173;yellow dots (50–200 µm) in a peripapillary, midperipheral, and anterior equatorial distribution (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-21)</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Acute lesions have a creamier, opaque appearance and develop more discrete borders over time. Varying degrees of anterior segment inflammation and vitritis are uniformly pres&#173;ent, which differentiate this condition from OHS or PIC. The lesions are smaller than &#173;those pres&#173;ent in birdshot chorioretinopathy or APMPPE, are larger than &#173;those found in PIC, and evolve into atrophic scars with varying degrees of hyperpigmentation. New lesions may appear, and peripheral chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal streaks and peripapillary pigment changes similar to &#173;those pres&#173;ent in OHS have been observed. Subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis with RPE clumping is much more common in MCP than in OHS. Structural complications noted at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion may include cataract, uveitis macular edema, ERM, and CNV and are frequent &#173;causes of visual impairment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fluorescein angiography shows early hypofluorescence with late staining of acute active lesions, whereas atrophic lesions produce transmission defects (early hyperfluorescence that fades in the late phases of the angiogram). Early hyperfluorescence and late leakage are observed in the presence of macular edema and CNV (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-22</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">As in birdshot chorioretinopathy, ICG angiography reveals multiple midphase hypocyanescent lesions compatible with active choroiditis that are more numerous than &#173;those apparent on clinical examination or FA; they are frequently clustered around the optic nerve. This finding may correlate with an enlarged blind spot on visual field testing. The hypofluorescent spots may fade with resolution of the intraocular inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common findings on FAF imaging are punctate hypoautofluorescent spots (<span class="symbol">≥</span>125 µm) corresponding to multiple areas of chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy; however, smaller (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>125 µm) spots numbering in the hundreds may be seen in the macular and peripapillary regions that are not vis&#173;i&#173;ble on fundus examination. Some of &#173;these lesions &#173;will &#173;later develop into clinically evident chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal scars (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-23</span>). Active MCP lesions display hyper&#173;autofluorescence that dis&#173;appears with minimal RPE disruption following anti-&#173;inflammatory treatment. Fundus autofluorescence findings in MCP suggest that patients have more widespread involvement of the RPE than indicated by other imaging modalities; therefore, FAF may be useful in monitoring response to treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Optical coherence tomography may show drusenlike material beneath the RPE at the site of vis&#173;i&#173;ble spots that can be associated with more widespread disruption of the overlying outer ret&#173;ina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-24</span>). &#173;There is also choroidal hyperreflectivity beneath &#173;these deposits.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The herpes simplex and Epstein-Barr viruses have been implicated in this disease pro&#173;cess; however, a viral etiology has not been proven. Pathologic specimens obtained from eyes with MCP have shown variable findings, ranging from large numbers of B lymphocytes in the choroid to a predominance of T lymphocytes, suggesting that dif&#173;fer&#173;ent immune mechanisms may produce a similar clinical picture, and that an initial viral infection may trigger an autoimmune pro&#173;cess.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Diagnosis</span> The diagnosis is one of exclusion, as many other conditions—&#173;such as sarcoidosis, syphilis, and TB—&#173;may produce lesions similar in appearance to &#173;those of MCP.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-12"><span class="h4-head">Treatment</span> Systemic and periocular corticosteroids may be effective for the treatment of macular edema and have been shown to induce regression of CNV in some patients. Corticosteroid-&#173;sparing strategies with IMT are frequently required &#173;because of the chronic, recurrent nature of the inflammation; &#173;these treatments have been successful in achieving not only inflammatory quiescence but also an 83% reduction in the risk of posterior pole complications (macular edema, ERM, and CNV) and a 92% reduction in the risk of vision loss to 20/200 or worse in affected eyes. The intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide implant is also a potential treatment option for patients who cannot tolerate systemic therapy. Intravitreal anti-&#173;VEGF drugs are impor&#173;tant adjuncts for the treatment of CNV. However, active inflammation can stimulate neovascularization and blunt the effectiveness of &#173;these treatments, so it is impor&#173;tant that inflammation also be well controlled. This concept applies to any uveitic entity complicated by CNV.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-12"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> Patients with PIC can pres&#173;ent with metamorphopsia, paracentral scotomata, photopsias, and asymmetric loss of central acuity. In contrast to the lesions of MCP, &#173;those of PIC are smaller (100–200 µm), rarely extend to the midperiphery, and are never associated with vitritis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-25</span>). They pro&#173;gress to atrophic scars, sometimes leaving a halo of pigmentation, and appear deeper and more punched-&#173;out than &#173;those of MCP. Macular edema is rarely seen in this condition, although serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments may be found over confluent PIC lesions. With the exception of CNV, patients with PIC have few structural complications (cataract, macular edema, or ERM) at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, unlike patients with MCP, a difference undoubtedly related to the presence of chronic intraocular inflammation in MCP. Choroidal neovascularization, a common vision-&#173;threatening complication in both entities, may be more frequent at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion in patients with PIC (79%) than with MCP (28%), but patients with MCP are more likely to have bilateral visual impairment of visual acuity 20/50 or worse.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fluorescein angiography studies in patients with PIC show early hypofluorescence of the inflammatory lesions with late staining, although early hyperfluorescence can also occur, especially if CNV is pres&#173;ent (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 9-26, 9-27</span>). Indocyanine green angiography displays midphase hypocyanescence throughout the posterior pole in a peripapillary distribution that may exceed the lesions apparent on FA and clinical examination (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-28</span>); &#173;these imaging studies may be employed to delineate disease extent and monitor its activity.

An antecedent viral prodrome occurs in approximately one-&#173;third of cases. Funduscopy during the acute phase of the disease reveals multiple, discrete, white-&#173;to-&#173;orange spots (100–200 µm) at the level of the RPE or deep ret&#173;ina, typically in a perifoveal location (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-32),</span> but can be found in the midperiphery and peripheral ret&#173;ina as well. &#173;These spots are transitory and frequently missed.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) is typified by acute loss of 1 or more zones of outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal function associated with photopsias and visual field loss, often in the setting of a normal-&#173;appearing fundus. Patients are typically young, myopic &#173;women who pres&#173;ent with acute unilateral visual disturbances, sometimes associated with a mild vitritis (50%), and visual acuity in the 20/40 range.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Manifestations</span> Electrophysiological studies demonstrate abnormality not only at the photoreceptor–&#173;RPE complex but also at the inner ret&#173;i&#173;nal level. Essentially, this dysfunction consists of a delayed 30-Hz flicker ERG and a reduction in the EOG light rise, which, when pres&#173;ent with classic symptomatology, may be helpful diagnostically. Visual field changes include paracentral defects and enlargement of the blind spot, even in the absence of any vis&#173;i&#173;ble fundus changes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With disease progression, subtle RPE changes may develop, with depigmentation in areas of vision loss (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-38</span>). Occasionally a demarcation line can be seen at the edge of active disease expansion. In &#173;later stages of disease, vessel attenuation, late pigment migration, and focal perivenous sheathing may be seen.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Optical coherence tomography demonstrates areas of loss or irregularity of the ellipsoid zone, corresponding to the visual field defects, and suggests that photoreceptor outer segment dysfunction and/or degeneration is the primary lesion in AZOOR (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-39</span>).</p>

The fundus may initially appear normal, but arteriolar attenuation, RPE mottling, and diffuse ret&#173;i&#173;nal and optic nerve atrophy may develop as the disease progresses. Inflammatory cells are rare or absent. Both visual field testing and ERG are typically abnormal, often markedly so. While the ERG in CAR typically demonstrates depressed cone responses, the ERG in MAR most commonly shows a normal photoreceptor response, followed by an attenuated b-&#173;wave. Visual prognosis is variable but generally poor.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Pathophysiology and diagnosis</span> The pathophysiology of AIR is thought to be related to an immune response to ret&#173;i&#173;nal proteins, some of which have been identified as potential targets. Recoverin, a photoreceptor-&#173;specific calcium-&#173;binding protein, is the most commonly associated antibody target in paraneoplastic retinopathy but has also been implicated in nonparaneoplastic retinopathy. The role of testing for antiret&#173;i&#173;nal antibodies is unclear at this point, as &#173;these antibodies are nonspecific, and it is not well understood which of them cause disease. Additionally, no standardized laboratory detection techniques for antiret&#173;i&#173;nal antibodies exist at this time, so test results between laboratories may vary widely.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis is one of exclusion; importantly, workup should include a thorough search for malignancy. The most common malignancy associated with CAR is small cell lung cancer.</p>

			<p class="h1">Panuveitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">By definition, <span class="italic">panuveitis</span> requires involvement of all anatomical compartments of the eye—&#173;namely, the anterior chamber, vitreous, and ret&#173;ina or choroid—&#173;with no single predominant site of inflammation. As with posterior uveitis, structural complications (eg, macular edema, ret&#173;i&#173;nal or choroidal neovascularization, and peripheral vasculitis) are not considered essential features in the anatomical classification of panuveitis. Generally, panuveitis is bilateral, although one eye may be affected first, and disease severity may be asymmetric. The discussion of panuveitis in this chapter is limited to the noninfectious entities.</p>
			<p class="h2">Sarcoidosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology with protean systemic and ocular manifestations. Although pulmonary manifestations are most common (90%), other sites frequently involved include the lymph nodes, skin, eyes, CNS, bones and joints, liver, and heart. Ocular involvement may be pres&#173;ent in up to 50% of patients with systemic disease, and uveitis is the most frequent manifestation. In most large series, sarcoidosis accounts for up to 10% of all cases of uveitis. The basic lesion of sarcoidosis is a noncaseating granuloma without histologic evidence of infection or foreign body (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-41</span>). See BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> for a more detailed description of the pathology of sarcoidosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sarcoidosis has a worldwide distribution and affects all ethnic groups; the highest prevalence is in the northern Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean countries (40 cases per 100,000 &#173;people). In the United States, the disease is up to 20 times more prevalent among African Americans than whites. Both sexes are affected, albeit with a slight female predominance. Although onset usually occurs between the ages of 20 and 50&#160;years, sarcoidosis is also an impor&#173;tant diagnostic consideration in older patients. In a recent review, sarcoidosis was a common cause of newly diagnosed uveitis among patients ages 60&#160;years and older. Patients with late-&#173;onset sarcoidosis may be more likely to have uveitis and less likely to have asymptomatic chest radiograph abnormalities than younger patients with the disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pediatric involvement is uncommon, and the clinical course is aty&#173;pi&#173;cal. &#173;Children with early-&#173;onset sarcoidosis (younger than 5&#160;years) are less likely than adults to manifest pulmonary disease and far more likely to have cutaneous and articular involvement; the disease course in older &#173;children (8–15&#160;years) approximates that in adults.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although numerous environmental, infectious, and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;factors have been implicated in causing the disease, no single etiologic agent or ge&#173;ne&#173;tic locus has been clearly identified in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. For instance, the ACCESS (A Case Control Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis) proj&#173;ect suggested that exposure to microbe-&#173;rich environments may modestly increase the risk of developing sarcoidosis; however, no dominant &#173;factor could be determined. Molecular studies of tissue specimens provide evidence suggesting that mycobacteria and, less convincingly, propionibacteria may be impor&#173;tant etiologic &#173;factors. A ge&#173;ne&#173;tic predisposition for the disease is suggested by familial clustering; siblings of patients have a fivefold-increased risk of developing the disease.</p>

			<p class="h3">Manifestations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Systemic sarcoidosis may pres&#173;ent acutely, frequently with associated anterior uveitis in young patients, and spontaneously remit within 2&#160;years of onset. One form of acute sarcoidosis, called <span class="italic">L</span><span class="accent_italic">ö</span><span class="italic">fgren syndrome,</span> consists of erythema nodosum, febrile arthropathy, bilateral hilar adenopathy, and acute iritis. This syndrome is quite responsive to systemic corticosteroids and has a good long-&#173;term prognosis. Another, termed <span class="italic">Heerfordt syndrome</span> (uveoparotid fever), is characterized by uveitis, parotitis, fever, and facial nerve palsy. Chronic sarcoidosis pres&#173;ents insidiously and is characterized by per&#173;sis&#173;tent disease of more than 2&#160;years’ duration, frequently with pulmonary involvement and chronic uveitis. Extended corticosteroid therapy may be required. Pulmonary disease is the major cause of morbidity; overall mortality from sarcoidosis approaches 5% but may be as high as 10% with neurosarcoidosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sarcoidosis can affect any ocular tissue, including the orbit and adnexa. Cutaneous involvement is frequent, and orbital and eyelid granulomas are common (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-42</span>). Palpebral and bulbar conjunctival nodules may also be observed and provide a readily accessible site for tissue biopsy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-43</span>). Lacrimal gland infiltration may cause dacryoadenitis and keratoconjunctivitis sicca.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anterior uveitis, presenting &#173;either acutely or as a chronic granulomatous uveitis, is the most common ocular manifestation, occurring in approximately two-&#173;thirds of patients with ocular sarcoidosis. Symptoms of uveal involvement are variable and frequently include mild-&#173;to-&#173;moderate blurring of vision and aching around the eyes. Typical biomicroscopic findings include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-7">mutton-&#173;fat keratic precipitates (KPs; Fig<span class="xref-figure"> 9-44</span>), including &#173;those involving the anterior chamber &#173;angle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Koeppe and Busacca iris nodules at the pupil margin and in the iris stroma, respectively (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-45</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">white clumps of cells (“snowballs”) in the anterior vitreous, typically settling inferiorly</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Although the cornea is infrequently involved, nummular corneal infiltrates and inferior corneal endothelial opacification may be pres&#173;ent; band keratopathy may develop as a result of &#173;either chronic uveitis or hypercalcemia. Large iris granulomas may also be noted. Extensive posterior synechiae may lead to iris bomb<span class="accent">é</span> and angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. Peripheral anterior synechiae may also be extensive, encompassing the entire &#173;angle in advanced cases. Secondary glaucoma, together with sarcoid uveitis, may be severe and portends a poor prognosis with associated severe vision loss.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Posterior segment manifestations occur in up to 20% of patients with ocular sarcoidosis. Vitreous involvement is common and often pres&#173;ents as clumps of snowballs with or without diffuse cellular infiltration. Vitreous cells may also form linear strands known as “strings of pearls.” Nodular granulomas mea&#173;sur&#173;ing from <span class="frac">¼</span> to 1 disc dia&#173;meter may be pres&#173;ent on the optic nerve, in both the ret&#173;ina and the choroid, &#173;either posteriorly or peripherally (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-46</span>). Perivascular sheathing is also common, appearing most commonly as &#173;either a linear or segmental periphlebitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-47</span>). Ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery macroaneurysms can occur. Irregular nodular granulomas along venules have been termed <span class="italic">candlewax </span><span class="italic">drippings</span> or <span class="italic">taches de bougie.</span> Occlusive ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular disease, especially branch ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion and, less commonly, central ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion, together with peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal capillary nonperfusion, may lead to ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization and vitreous hemorrhage. Macular edema is frequently pres&#173;ent, and optic disc edema without granulomatous invasion of the optic nerve may be observed in patients with papilledema and neurosarcoidosis. In addition, sarcoidosis may be associated with an inflammatory optic neuropathy, with or without concurrent intraocular inflammation.</p>

			<p class="h3">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Given its heterogeneous pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, sarcoidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient presenting with intraocular inflammation. Early-&#173;onset sarcoidosis in &#173;children (5&#160;years of age or younger) must be differentiated from JIA-&#173;associated anterior uveitis and from familial juvenile systemic granulomatosis (Blau syndrome), given the overlap of ocular and articular involvement. Familial juvenile systemic granulomatosis, an autosomal dominantly inherited syndrome with 100% phenotypic correspondence to mutations in the <span class="italic">NOD2</span> gene (also known as <span class="italic">CARD15</span>), may produce ocular disease that is virtually identical to sarcoidosis and should be suspected in patients with a &#173;family history of granulomatous disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chest radiograph abnormalities are pres&#173;ent at some point in up to 90% of sarcoid patients, but &#173;these abnormalities do not persist throughout the disease course and thus may be absent at the time of workup. High-&#173;resolution chest computed tomography is a more sensitive imaging modality and may be particularly valuable in patients with a normal appearance on chest radiograph but for whom a high clinical index of suspicion remains; the risk of increased radiation must be weighed against the clinical utility of the information gained in such cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the serum angiotensin-&#173;converting enzyme (ACE) and lysozyme levels may be abnormally elevated, neither result is diagnostic nor specific; rather, they are reflective of total-&#173;body granuloma content and, as such, may be useful in tracking active disease. (Note that the ACE levels may be artificially low in patients taking ACE-&#173;inhibitor medi&#173;cations.) Other laboratory evaluations that may have utility include serum and urinary calcium levels and liver function tests; they are not specific for sarcoidosis but may suggest more widespread involvement in patients likely to have the disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Gallium scanning has been used to check for occult disease activity, but it has limited sensitivity. Fluorine-18-&#173;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is considered more accurate in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sarcoidosis, but its utility in ophthalmic sarcoidosis is not well defined. The finding of mononuclear alveolitis with increased CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> lymphocytes, as revealed by bronchoalveolar lavage, can also help support the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The traditional approach for suspected ophthalmic involvement with sarcoidosis is to obtain a chest radiograph, possibly along with ACE and lysozyme levels. The additional tests mentioned above can then supplement the workup, depending on the degree of suspicion and/or preference of the managing physician.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ultimately, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made histologically from tissue obtained from the lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes, skin, peripheral lymph nodes, liver, conjunctiva, minor salivary glands, or lacrimal glands. Readily accessible and clinically evident lesions (such as &#173;those on the skin, palpable lymph nodes, and nodules on the conjunctiva) should be sought for biopsy, &#173;because they are associated with a high yield and low morbidity and may obviate the need for more invasive transbronchial biopsy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Currently, &#173;there is no gold standard for diagnosing ocular sarcoidosis. Diagnostic criteria for ocular sarcoidosis &#173;were proposed in an international workshop of ophthalmologists in 2009. &#173;These criteria consist of diagnostic grades ranging from “definitive” (based on tissue biopsy), to “presumed” (based on typical ocular findings in combination with bilateral hilar adenopathy), to “probable” or “pos&#173;si&#173;ble” disease (with supporting ancillary evidence). When &#173;these criteria &#173;were evaluated using a large group of patients with uveitis, &#173;there was no clinical sign or test that was highly sensitive in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, with the exception of bilateral hilar adenopathy; in fact, a large percentage (40%) of clinician-&#173;suspected cases did not meet any of the criteria.</p>
			<p class="h3">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topical, periocular, and systemic corticosteroids are the mainstays of therapy for ocular sarcoidosis. Cycloplegia is useful for comfort and prevention of synechiae. Vision-&#173;threatening posterior segment disease generally requires, and is responsive to, systemic corticosteroids. Intravitreal corticosteroids, including the fluocinolone acetonide and dexamethasone implants, are potential treatment options for patients intolerant of systemic therapy, but they do not treat systemic disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic IMT with methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclosporine can provide good control of the disease while minimizing the risks of long-&#173;term corticosteroid therapy. The TNF-&#173;<span class="symbol">α</span> inhibitors infliximab and adalimumab have been shown to be effective in the treatment of sarcoidosis-&#173;associated uveitis. Paradoxically, the TNF-&#173;<span class="symbol">α</span> inhibitor etanercept has been reported to cause a sarcoid-&#173;like syndrome in some patients. The likelihood of significant visual improvement is substantially increased with systemic therapy; patients with chronic vision-&#173;threatening sarcoidosis seem to respond better to IMT than to management with intermittent local or systemic corticosteroids.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prognostic &#173;factors associated with vision loss in patients with ocular sarcoidosis include chronic intermediate or posterior uveitis, glaucoma, and a delay in pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion to a uveitis specialist of more than 1 year.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-24">Sympathetic Ophthalmia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) is a rare, bilateral, diffuse, granulomatous, nonnecrotizing panuveitis that may develop &#173;after &#173;either surgical or accidental trauma to 1 eye (called the <span class="italic">exciting eye</span>), followed by a latent period and the appearance of uveitis in the uninjured fellow eye (the <span class="italic">sympathizing eye</span>). Although the precise incidence of SO is difficult to ascertain &#173;because of its rarity, significant improvements in the management of ocular trauma have led to an overall decrease. Earlier estimates of the incidence of SO ranged from 0.01% &#173;after intraocular surgery to 0.5% in eyes with nonsurgical trauma. Although the most recent minimum incidence estimate is low (0.03/100,000), SO remains a disease with a per&#173;sis&#173;tent and potentially devastating presence.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Accidental penetrating ocular trauma was once the most common precipitating event for SO. Ocular surgery—&#173;particularly vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal surgery—&#173;has emerged as the main risk for the development of SO. In the early 1980s, the prevalence of SO in patients who had under&#173;gone pars plana vitrectomy was reported to be 0.01%, increasing to 0.06% when the procedure was performed in the context of other penetrating ocular injuries. More recent studies suggest that the risk of developing SO following pars plana vitrectomy is more than twice this figure and may be significantly higher than the risk of infectious endophthalmitis &#173;after vitrectomy. Improved access to emergency surgical care following penetrating ocular trauma and improved microsurgical technique have undoubtedly influenced this etiologic shift from penetrating injury to surgical trauma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Similarly, the demographic of SO has changed from earlier reports, in which &#173;there was higher prevalence among men, &#173;children, and older patients (due to their presumed increased risk of accidental trauma), to more recent studies, which show no sex predominance and a lower risk in &#173;children (resulting in part from a reduced incidence of pediatric ocular injuries), as well as an increased risk in older patients (likely stemming from an increased frequency of ocular surgery and ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment in this population).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, although SO has traditionally been reported to develop in 80% of patients within 3 months of injury and in 90% within 1 year, &#173;these time intervals may actually be longer than previously thought. In a recent series, only one-&#173;third of patients developed SO within 3 months, and less than one-&#173;half did so within 1 year of injury.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Manifestations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with SO typically pres&#173;ent with asymmetric bilateral panuveitis, in which the exciting eye exhibits more severe inflammation than the sympathizing eye, at least initially. Signs and symptoms vary in their severity and onset. Anterior segment findings include mutton-&#173;fat KPs, thickening of the iris from lymphocytic infiltration, and posterior synechiae formation. Intraocular pressure (IOP) may be elevated, due to trabeculitis, or low as a result of ciliary body shutdown.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Posterior segment findings include moderate to severe vitritis with characteristic &#173;yellowish white, midperipheral choroidal lesions (<span class="italic">Dalen-&#173;Fuchs nodules</span>) that may become confluent. Peripapillary choroidal lesions and exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment may also develop (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-48</span>). Structural complications of SO include cataract, chronic macular edema, peripapillary and macular CNV, and optic atrophy. In a recent study, complications in the sympathizing eye at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion &#173;were frequent (up to 47%); cataract and optic nerve abnormalities &#173;were most often associated with decreased vision and the further development of new complications, which occurred at a rate of 40% per person-&#173;year. Furthermore, a history of traumatic injury, the presence of active intraocular inflammation, and exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment correlated with poorer vision in the sympathizing eye. Extraocular findings similar to &#173;those observed with VKH syndrome, including ce&#173;re&#173;bral spinal fluid pleocytosis, sensory neural hearing disturbance, alopecia, poliosis, and vitiligo, may be noted, although they are uncommon.</p>
			<p class="body-text">During the acute stage of the disease, FA reveals multiple hyperfluorescent sites of leakage during the early phase, which persists into the late phase of the study (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-49</span>). Pooling of dye is observed in areas of exudative neurosensory ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Multiple chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions may be pres&#173;ent and appear hypofluorescent in early phases, simulating the pattern seen in APMPPE, or hyperfluorescent with late staining. Indocyanine green angiography reveals numerous hypocyanescent foci, which are best visualized during the intermediate phase of the angiogram; some of &#173;these foci may become less visible in the late stage of the study (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-50</span>). Optical coherence tomography may demonstrate a shallow, serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment and/or intraret&#173;i&#173;nal edema, and monitoring &#173;these findings can help determine the efficacy of treatment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-51</span>). B-&#173;scan ultrasonography frequently reveals choroidal thickening.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The histologic features of SO are similar for both the exciting and sympathizing eyes. Findings include diffuse, granulomatous, nonnecrotizing infiltration of the choroid that classically spares the choriocapillaris in the early stage. Dalen-&#173;Fuchs nodules, which are clusters of epithelioid cells located between the RPE and Bruch membrane, are pres&#173;ent in about one-&#173;third of patients. The nodules are not specific to SO and can also be found in VKH syndrome and sarcoidosis (see BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;4</span>, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors</span>).</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-25">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The precise etiology of SO is unknown; however, in the overwhelming majority of patients, &#173;there is a history of surgery or penetrating ocular injury complicated by incarceration of uveal tissue. The disorder may result from altered T-&#173;lymphocyte responses to previously sequestered ocular antigens derived from the RPE or choroid. The penetrating wound itself may facilitate exposure of uveoret&#173;i&#173;nal antigens to conjunctival lymphatic channels and thereby initiate this immunopathologic response. Furthermore, &#173;there may be a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic predisposition to the development of the disease, as patients with SO are more likely to express HLA-&#173;DR4, -&#173;DRw53, and -&#173;DQw3 haplotypes. It should be noted that the immunoge&#173;ne&#173;tics of SO and VKH syndrome are virtually identical, as the same associations have been found in both diseases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of SO is clinical, and the disorder should be suspected in the presence of bilateral uveitis following any ocular trauma or surgery. Differential diagnosis includes other &#173;causes of panuveitis, including TB, sarcoidosis, syphilis, and fungal infections, as well as traumatic or postoperative endophthalmitis. Lens-&#173;associated uveitis has been reported with SO in up to 25% of cases and may pres&#173;ent with a similar clinical picture. The clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions of SO and VKH syndrome may be strikingly similar; however, a history of prior ocular injury is by definition absent in patients with VKH syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h3">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The course of SO is chronic, with frequent exacerbations; however, it is a treatable condition, and in cases with penetrating trauma, &#173;every attempt should be made to salvage eyes with a reasonable prognosis for useful vision. Enucleation within 2 weeks of injury to prevent the development of SO should be considered in patients with grossly disor&#173;ga&#173;nized globes and no discernible visual potential. Although controversial, enucleation may still be preferred to evisceration as the operation of choice for the removal of ocular contents in severely injured eyes, &#173;because it eliminates the possibility of residual uveal tissue, which may predispose to the development of sympathetic disease. BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;7</span>, <span class="italic">Oculofacial </span><span class="italic">Plastic and Orbital Surgery,</span> discusses the advantages and disadvantages of enucleation&#160;and evisceration in greater detail. Regardless of visual potential, once SO has developed, enucleation of the exciting eye has not been shown to be beneficial in altering the disease course of the sympathizing eye. In fact, the exciting eye may eventually become the better-&#173;seeing eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The initial treatment of SO involves systemic corticosteroids, with the frequent addition of corticosteroid-&#173;sparing drugs such as azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, chlorambucil, and cyclophosphamide, as chronic therapy is anticipated in most patients. Topical corticosteroids are essential in the treatment of the acute anterior uveitis associated with SO. Periocular and intravitreal corticosteroids, including the intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide implant, are options for patients intolerant of systemic corticosteroid therapy. With prompt and aggressive systemic therapy, the visual prognosis of SO is good; 60% of patients achieve a final visual acuity of 20/40, although up to 25% may decline to 20/200 or worse in the sympathizing eye.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vogt-&#173;Koyanagi-&#173;Harada syndrome is a multisystem disease of presumed autoimmune etiology that is characterized by chronic, bilateral, diffuse, granulomatous panuveitis with accompanying integumentary, neurologic, and auditory involvement. Although the disease more commonly affects some of the more darkly pigmented ethnic groups—&#173;including &#173;people of Asians, Hispanic, Native American, and &#173;Middle Eastern ancestry—&#173;and is uncommon among whites, VKH syndrome is also rare among sub-&#173;Saharan Africans, suggesting that additional &#173;factors, other than skin pigmentation, are impor&#173;tant in its pathogenesis. The incidence of VKH syndrome varies geo&#173;graph&#173;i&#173;cally, accounting for up to 4% of all uveitis referrals in the United States and 8% in Japan. In Brazil and Saudi Arabia, it is the most commonly encountered cause of noninfectious uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The precise etiology and pathogenesis of VKH syndrome are unknown, but current clinical and experimental evidence suggests a cell-&#173;mediated autoimmune pro&#173;cess driven by T lymphocytes directed against self-&#173;antigens associated with melanocytes of all organ systems in genet&#173;ically susceptible individuals. A ge&#173;ne&#173;tic predisposition for the development of the disease is further supported by the strong association with HLA-&#173;DR4 among Japa&#173;nese patients and with HLA-&#173;DR1 or HLA-&#173;DR4 among Hispanic patients from southern California.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Histologic findings</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are 4 clinically distinct stages of VKH syndrome: (1) prodromal, (2) acute uveitic, (3) convalescent, and (4) chronic recurrent. Histologic findings vary depending on the stage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">During the acute uveitic stage, &#173;there is a diffuse, nonnecrotizing, granulomatous inflammation virtually identical to that seen in SO, consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages admixed with epithelioid and multinucleate &#173;giant cells, with preservation of the choriocapillaris. Proteinaceous fluid exudates are observed in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space between the detached neurosensory ret&#173;ina and the RPE. Although the peripapillary choroid is the predominant site of granulomatous inflammatory infiltration, the ciliary body and iris may also be affected.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The convalescent stage is characterized by nongranulomatous inflammation, with uveal infiltration of lymphocytes, few plasma cells, and the absence of epithelioid histiocytes. The number of choroidal melanocytes decreases with loss of melanin pigment, which corresponds with the characteristic clinical feature known as <span class="italic">sunset-&#173;glow fundus</span>. In addition, the appearance of numerous nummular chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal scars in the peripheral ret&#173;ina histologically corresponds to the focal loss of RPE cells with chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal adhesions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The chronic recurrent stage is characterized by granulomatous choroiditis with damage to the choriocapillaris. The numerous clinical, pathologic, and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic similarities between SO and VKH syndrome suggest that they share a similar immunopathogenesis, albeit with dif&#173;fer&#173;ent triggering events and modes of sensitization.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-26">Manifestations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinical features of VKH syndrome also vary depending on the stage of the disease. The prodromal stage is marked by flulike symptoms. Several days preceding the onset of ocular symptoms, patients may pres&#173;ent with headache, nausea, meningismus, dysacusia, tinnitus, fever, orbital pain, photophobia, and hypersensitivity of the skin to touch. Focal neurologic signs, although rare, may include cranial neuropathies, hemiparesis, aphasia, transverse myelitis, and ganglionitis. Cerebrospinal fluid analy&#173;sis reveals lymphocytic pleocytosis with normal levels of glucose in more than 80% of patients; this finding may persist for up to 8 weeks. Central dysacusia, usually involving higher frequencies, occurs in approximately 30% of patients early in the disease course, typically improving within 2–3 months; however, per&#173;sis&#173;tent deficits may remain.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The acute uveitic stage is heralded by the onset of sequential blurring of vision in both eyes, 1–2 days &#173;after the onset of CNS signs, and is marked by bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis, a variable degree of vitritis, thickening of the posterior choroid, edema of the optic nerve, and multiple serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-52</span>). The focal serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments are often shallow, exhibiting a cloverleaf pattern around the posterior pole, but they may coalesce and evolve into large, bullous, exudative detachments. Profound vision loss may occur during this phase. Less commonly, mutton-&#173;fat KPs and iris nodules at the pupillary margin may be observed. IOP may be elevated, and the anterior chamber may be shallow &#173;because of forward displacement of the lens–&#173;iris diaphragm as the result of ciliary body edema or annular choroidal detachment. Alternatively, IOP may be low, secondary to ciliary body shutdown.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The convalescent stage occurs several weeks &#173;later and is marked by resolution of the exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments and gradual depigmentation of the choroid, resulting in the classic orange-&#173;red discoloration, or sunset-&#173;glow fundus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-53</span>). In addition, small, round, discrete depigmented lesions develop in the inferior peripheral fundus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-54</span>). Juxtapapillary depigmentation may also be seen (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-55</span>). The sunset-&#173;glow fundus may show focal areas of ret&#173;i&#173;nal hyper-&#173; or hypopigmentation. Perilimbal vitiligo (Sugiura sign) may be pres&#173;ent in up to 85% of Japa&#173;nese patients but is rarely observed among white patients (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-56</span>). Integumentary changes, including vitiligo, alopecia, and poliosis, typically appear during the convalescent stage in about 30% of patients and correspond with the development of fundus depigmentation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-57</span>). In general, skin and hair changes occur weeks to months &#173;after the onset of ocular inflammation, but in some cases, they may appear si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously. Between 10% and 63% of patients develop vitiligo, depending on ethnic background; among Hispanic patients, the incidence of cutaneous and other extraocular manifestations is relatively low.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The chronic recurrent stage is marked by repeated bouts of granulomatous anterior uveitis, with the development of KPs, posterior synechiae, iris nodules, iris depigmentation, and stromal atrophy. Recurrent posterior segment inflammation can occur but is uncommon during this stage. Visually debilitating sequelae of chronic inflammation develop during this stage and include posterior subcapsular cataract, glaucoma, CNV, and subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis.</p>

			<p class="h3">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Based on the clinical features and their distinctive appearance within the overall disease course, comprehensive diagnostic criteria for the complete, incomplete, and probable forms of VKH syndrome &#173;were revised in 2001 (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;9-2</span>). Regardless of the form of the disease, essential features for the diagnosis of VKH syndrome include bilateral involvement, no history of penetrating ocular trauma, and no evidence of other ocular or systemic disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of VKH syndrome is essentially clinical; exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment during the acute disease and sunset-&#173;glow fundus during the chronic phase are highly specific to this entity. In patients presenting without extraocular manifestations, FA, ICG angiography, OCT, FAF imaging, lumbar puncture, and ultrasonography may be useful confirmatory tests. During the acute uveitic stage, FA typically reveals numerous punctate hyperfluorescent foci in the early stage of the study, followed by pooling of dye in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space in areas of neurosensory detachment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-58</span>). The vast majority of patients show disc leakage, but macular edema and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular leakage are uncommon. In the convalescent and chronic recurrent stages, focal RPE loss and atrophy produce multiple hyperfluorescent win&#173;dow defects without progressive staining.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Indocyanine green angiography highlights the choroidal pathology, demonstrating a delay in choroidal perfusion, early choroidal hypercyanescence and leakage, multiple hypocyanescent spots throughout the fundus (thought to correspond to foci of lymphocytic infiltration), and hypercyancescent pinpoint changes within areas of exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. The hypocyanescent spots may be pres&#173;ent even when the funduscopic and FA findings are unremarkable; thus, they serve as sensitive markers for the detection and monitoring of subclinical choroidal inflammation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ultrasonography may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis, especially in the presence of media opacity. Findings include diffuse, low to medium reflective thickening of the posterior choroid that is most prominent in the peripapillary area, with extension to the equatorial region, exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, vitreous opacification, and posterior thickening of the sclera.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Optical coherence tomography may be useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of serous macular detachments, macular edema, and choroidal neovascular membranes. Patients may have characteristic fibrin bands extending from the ret&#173;ina to the RPE in the acute phase (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-59</span>). Enhanced-&#173;depth OCT imaging demonstrates choroidal thickening in the acute phase that decreases with treatment. The combined use of OCT and FAF imaging, which shows granular hyperautofluorescence in areas of inflammation, offers a noninvasive assessment of RPE and outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal inflammation that may not be apparent on clinical examination in patients with chronic VKH syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In highly aty&#173;pi&#173;cal cases—&#173;particularly patients presenting early in the course of the disease with prominent neurologic signs and a paucity of ocular findings—&#173;a lumbar puncture, revealing lymphocytic pleocytosis, may be useful diagnostically. However, in the vast majority of cases, the history and clinical examination, together with results of FA and/or ultrasonography, are sufficient to establish the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The differential diagnosis of VKH syndrome includes SO, uveal effusion syndrome, posterior scleritis, primary intraocular lymphoma, uveal lymphoid infiltration, APMPPE, bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation, TB-&#173;associated uveitis, and sarcoidosis. &#173;These entities may be differentiated from VKH syndrome by a thorough history, review of systems, and examination, together with a directed laboratory evaluation.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-27">Treatment and prognosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The acute stage of VKH syndrome is responsive to early and aggressive treatment with corticosteroids. Initial dosages typically are 1–1.5&#160;mg/kg/day of oral prednisone or up to 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone daily for 3 days, followed by high-&#173;dose oral corticosteroids. Oral versus intravenous routes of administration show no demonstrable differences in visual acuity outcomes or the development of visually significant complications. For patients intolerant of systemic therapy, use of intravitreal corticosteroids, including the intravitreal fluocinolone acetonide and dexamethasone implants, is an option. Systemic corticosteroids are tapered slowly according to the clinical response, on average over a 6–12-&#173;month period, in an effort to prevent progression of the disease to the chronic recurrent stage and to minimize the incidence and severity of extraocular manifestations. Tapering corticosteroids too soon can result in early recurrence.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Despite adequate initial treatment with systemic corticosteroids, many patients experience recurrent episodes of inflammation. This risk has led many experts to initiate IMT earlier to achieve more prompt inflammatory control and to facilitate more rapid tapering of corticosteroids. The overall visual prognosis for patients treated in this fashion is fair, with up to 70% of patients retaining visual acuity of 20/40 or better.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Structural complications associated with ocular morbidity include cataract formation (50%), glaucoma (33%), CNV (up to 15%), and subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis, the development of which is associated with increased disease duration, more frequent recurrences, and an older age at disease onset.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The use of &#173;either oral corticosteroids or IMT with extended follow-up has been shown to reduce the risk of vision loss and the development of some structural complications. Specifically, oral corticosteroids reduced the risk of CNV and subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis by 82% and the risk of visual acuity decline to 20/200 or worse (in better-&#173;seeing eyes) by 67%. IMT was associated with risk reductions of 67% for vision loss to 20/50 or worse and 92% for vision loss to 20/200 or worse in better-&#173;seeing eyes.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-28">Beh<span class="h2_accent">ç</span>et Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease (BD) is a chronic, relapsing, multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. It can affect both the anterior and the posterior segments of the eye, often si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously. The disease symptoms have been described for more than 2500&#160;years. They &#173;were formally characterized in the early 20th&#160;&#173;century by Adamantiades and Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et as a triad of aphthous ulceration, genital lesions, and recurrent uveitis. It is now known to affect almost any organ system and occurs in a variety of ethnic populations all over the world. It is most common in the Northern Hemi&#173;sphere in the countries of the eastern Mediterranean and on the eastern rim of Asia, particularly along the ancient Silk Road. The prevalence of BD varies from as high as 20–421 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Turkey to 8–13.5 per 100,000&#160;in Japan and 5.2 per 100,000&#160;in the United States. The age of onset is typically in the third and fourth de&#173;cades but can also occur &#173;after age 50 or in childhood. Both genders are affected equally, but BD may have a more severe course in males. Although &#173;there have been some familial cases of BD, most are sporadic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of BD is clinical and is based on the presence of multiple systemic findings. The diagnostic system for BD in &#173;Table&#160;9-3 was suggested by researchers in Japan, and another diagnostic system was suggested by the International Study Group for Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et’s Disease (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;9-4</span>). Although BD is a multisystem disease, it can have its predominant effect on a single system; thus, special clinical types of BD occur—&#173;namely, neuro-&#173;BD, ocular BD, intestinal BD, and vascular BD. However, importantly, being &#173;free from major organ involvement early in the disease does not protect against its development &#173;later on. Epidemiologic studies also report significant regional variability in organ-&#173;specific disease expression.</p>

			<p class="h3">Nonocular systemic manifestations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Recurrent, painful oral aphthae are the most frequent finding and often the presenting sign in BD (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-60</span>). They can occur on the lips, gums, palate, tongue, uvula, and posterior pharynx. They are discrete, rounded, white ulcerations with red rims varying in size from 2 to 15&#160;mm. They typically last 7–10 days and heal with &#173;little scarring &#173;unless large.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Genital ulcers appear grossly similar to oral aphthous ulcers, but tend to be deeper and larger and heal with more scarring. In male patients, they can occur on the scrotum or penis. In female patients, they can appear on the vulva and vaginal mucosa. Genital scarring may be apparent on examination even if patients have no acute symptoms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Skin lesions can include painful or recurrent erythema nodosum, often over extensor surfaces such as the tibia, but also on the face, neck, and buttocks. Acne vulgaris or folliculitis-&#173;like skin lesions may frequently appear on the upper thorax and face. Skin lesions may dis&#173;appear spontaneously with minimal or no scarring. Nearly 40% of patients with BD exhibit cutaneous pathergy, which is characterized by the development of a sterile pustule at the site of a venipuncture or an injection but is not pathognomonic of BD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Systemic vasculitis affecting any size artery or vein in the body may occur in up to 25% of patients with BD. Common manifestations are arterial occlusions and aneurysms, and superficial or deep venous occlusions and varices. Cardiac involvement can include granulomatous endocarditis, myocarditis, endomyo&#173;car&#173;dial fibrosis, coronary arteritis, and pericarditis. Gastrointestinal lesions, such as ulcers involving the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, may be seen in over 50% of BD patients in Japan, where it is a significant cause of morbidity. Pulmonary involvement is mainly pulmonary arteritis with aneurysmal dilatation of the pulmonary artery. Fifty &#173;percent of patients with BD develop arthritis, commonly of the knee, elbow, hand, or ankle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Neurologic involvement is among the most serious of all manifestations of BD. &#173;Lesions&#160;of the white &#173;matter of the brain and brainstem may lead to motor dysfunction, stroke, and cognitive/behavioral changes. Headaches and aseptic meningitis have been associated with CNS vasculitis and meningeal involvement, respectively. Ten &#173;percent of patients with neuro-&#173;BD can have ocular disease, and 30% of patients with ocular BD may have neurologic involvement. Mortality has previously been reported to be as high as 10% in patients with neuro-&#173;BD, but it may be lower currently, especially with the use of IMT. Neuro-&#173;ophthalmic involvement can include cranial nerve palsies, papillitis, and papilledema resulting from thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus or other venous sinuses.</p>
			<p class="h3">Ocular manifestations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular manifestations affect up to 70% of patients with BD. They carry serious implications &#173;because they are often recurrent and relapsing, resulting in permanent ocular damage. Severe vision loss can occur in up to 25% of patients with BD. Ocular disease most often pres&#173;ents as panuveitis that appears to be more severe and more common in men; over 80% of cases are bilateral. Ocular involvement as an initial presenting prob&#173;lem is relatively uncommon, and &#173;there may be a delay of years between presenting signs in other organs and the first occurrence of uveitis. The intraocular inflammation is characterized by a nongranulomatous, necrotizing, obliterative vasculitis that can affect any or all portions of the uveal tract.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In a minority of cases, anterior uveitis may be the only ocular manifestation of BD, classically described as the sudden onset of a hypopyon that dis&#173;appears over weeks with or without treatment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-61</span>). The anterior uveitis may be accompanied by redness, pain, photophobia, and blurred vision, though occasionally &#173;there is a striking lack of inflammatory signs and symptoms, manifesting as a relatively quiet eye, despite the presence of hypopyon. On clinical examination, the hypopyon can shift with the patient’s head position or disperse with head shaking, and it may not be vis&#173;i&#173;ble &#173;unless viewed by gonioscopy. With relapses, posterior synechiae, iris bomb<span class="accent">é</span>, and angle-&#173;closure glaucoma may all develop. Other less-&#173;common anterior segment findings of BD include cataract, episcleritis, scleritis, conjunctival ulcers, and corneal immune ring opacities.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Posterior segment manifestations of ocular BD are often profoundly sight threatening. The essential finding is an occlusive ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis affecting both arteries and veins, which may be associated with multifocal areas of chalky white retinitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-62</span>). Posterior and panuveitis are the most common types of BD ocular inflammation, seen in 50%–80% of cases of BD patients with uveitis. Other posterior manifestations can include ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery and vein occlusions, vascular sheathing with variable amounts of vitritis, and associated uveitic macular edema. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal ischemia can lead to the development of ret&#173;i&#173;nal and iris neovascularization with neovascular glaucoma. &#173;After repeated episodes of ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis and vascular occlusions, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels may become white and sclerotic. The ischemic nature of the vasculitis and accompanying retinitis may produce a funduscopic appearance that may be confused with acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis syndrome or other necrotizing herpetic entities (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-63</span> and <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11)</span>. The optic nerve is affected in 25% of patients with BD. Optic papillitis can occur, but progressive optic atrophy may occur as a result of the vasculitis affecting the arterioles that supply blood to the optic nerve.</p>
			<p class="h3">Pathogenesis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many environmental &#173;factors have been suggested as potential &#173;causes of BD, but none has been proven. No infectious agent or microorganism has been reproducibly isolated from the lesions of patients with BD. The disorder is clinically and experimentally unlike other autoimmune diseases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">HLA associations have been found in 2 systemic forms of BD: HLA-&#173;B12 with mucocutaneous lesions and HLA-&#173;B51 with ocular lesions. &#173;These associations are not reproducible in all populations, and testing lacks the sensitivity and specificity to support its use for diagnosis. Histologically, BD lesions resemble &#173;those of delayed-&#173;type hypersensitivity reactions early on; late lesions resemble &#173;those of immune-&#173;complex–&#173;type reactions. Histopathology may show an inflammatory occlusive vasculitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-64</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Laboratory tests—&#173;for example, HLA typing, cutaneous pathergy testing, and blood tests for ESR and CRP—&#173;are of &#173;little value in confirming the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fluorescein angiography demonstrates marked dilatation and occlusion of ret&#173;i&#173;nal capillaries with perivascular staining, evidence of ret&#173;i&#173;nal ischemia, leakage of fluorescein into the macula with the development of macular edema, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization that may leak (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-65</span>). Subtle vascular leakage may be pres&#173;ent on FA even during periods of clinical quiescence. Adjusting therapy in response to this leakage may prevent the development of inflammatory damage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because of the transient nature of posterior segment inflammatory episodes in BD, serial color photography may be of benefit in diagnosis.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The goal of treatment is not only to treat the explosive onset of acute disease with systemic corticosteroids but also to control chronic inflammation and prevent or decrease the number of relapses of ocular inflammation with IMT. Posterior segment ocular BD is an absolute indication for prompt initiation of IMT.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An American expert panel has recommended TNF inhibitor therapy with infliximab (good-&#173;quality evidence) or adalimumab (moderate-&#173;quality evidence) as first-&#173; or second-&#173;line corticosteroid-&#173;sparing therapy. A Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean League Against Rheumatism panel has recommended using azathioprine (with corticosteroids) as first-&#173;line IMT for ocular BD and cyclosporine or infliximab as second-&#173;line treatment. When other major organs are involved, close collaboration with specialists in other fields is necessary, as treatment modifications based on severity and type of BD may be required.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Corticosteroids</span> Systemic corticosteroids (eg, 1.0–1.5&#160;mg/kg/day of prednisone with a gradual taper) are extremely useful in controlling acute inflammation. Periocular and intravitreal ste&#173;roids may also be a useful adjunct in selected patients. Corticosteroid monotherapy should be avoided in sight-threatening BD uveitis, as severe rebound attacks may occur during tapering.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Nonbiologic IMT</span> Only azathioprine and cyclosporine have under&#173;gone randomized clinical &#173;trials indicating effectiveness in reducing uveitis recurrence and preserving vision. Uncontrolled &#173;trials have shown benefit with mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus as steroid-&#173;sparing agents; alkylating agents, while effective, are used less frequently due to serious side effects. Chlorambucil administration can help achieve a durable remission in ocular BD. Cyclophosphamide is an alternative to chlorambucil and can be used orally or as pulsed intravenous therapy. Both of &#173;these alkylating agents have been shown to be more effective than cyclosporine in the management of posterior segment ocular BD but carry a greater risk of systemic complications and require complex hematologic monitoring. The availability of biologic drugs has led most experts to reserve the use of alkylating agents for patients with severe refractory disease.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Biologic agents</span> The use of systemic TNF inhibitors has heralded a new era in the treatment of ocular BD. A substantial body of lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture has emerged demonstrating the long-&#173;term efficacy and relative safety of systemic infliximab use in severe refractory &#173;ocular BD, often achieving rapid and complete control of disease, with reduction in &#173;ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular leakage, as shown in FA; preservation of vision; and reduced recurrences. Additional data suggest greater benefit of infliximab therapy when initiated early on in the disease course. Adalimumab has been studied to a lesser extent, although preliminary data are promising, including a cohort studied prospectively as a part of the phase 3 clinical &#173;trials of adalimumab for noninfectious posterior uveitis. Interferon alfa is a naturally occurring cytokine involved in immune regulation, which, when administered in ocular BD as interferon alfa-2a, has been shown in a number of observational studies to be a safe and effective therapy. Combined with its lower cost and compatibility with concomitant latent tuberculosis infection, some experts prefer it as first-line therapy specific to ocular BD.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-25">Prognosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The prognosis for vision is guarded in patients with BD. Nearly 25% of patients worldwide with chronic ocular BD have visual acuity less than 20/200, most commonly caused by macular edema, occlusive ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, optic atrophy, and glaucoma. Adult men tend to have poorer vision outcomes. Patients appear to have a better visual prognosis &#173;because of earlier and more aggressive use of IMT. The presence of posterior synechiae, per&#173;sis&#173;tent inflammation, elevated IOP, and hypotony are all statistically significant predictive &#173;factors for vision loss. The chronic relapsing nature of this disease, with frequent exacerbations &#173;after long periods of remission, makes it difficult to predict visual outcomes.</p>
