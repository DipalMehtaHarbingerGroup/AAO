			<div id="Chapt15_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ophthalmic manifestations may be the first sign of disseminated systemic HIV infection and have been reported in up to 70% of infected &#173;people. &#173;These manifestations include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">HIV-&#173;related microangiopathy of the ret&#173;ina</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">opportunistic viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal infections</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Reports also suggest that HIV infection itself may cause anterior or intermediate uveitis that is not responsive to corticosteroids but improves with antiretroviral therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common ocular finding in patients infected with HIV is HIV retinopathy. It is a microangiopathy, characterized mainly by cotton-&#173;wool spots (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-1</span>) but also by microaneurysms and ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages. HIV has been isolated from the &#173;human ret&#173;ina, and its antigen has been detected in ret&#173;i&#173;nal endothelial cells. The&#160;HIV endothelial infection and/or rheologic abnormalities may play a role in the development of cotton-&#173;wool spots and other vascular alterations. In addition, accelerated aging may be a part of HIV-&#173;associated eye disease, with earlier onset of macular degeneration and cataracts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other infectious agents that can affect the eye in HIV-&#173;infected patients include cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex and zoster viruses, <span class="italic">Toxoplasma gondii, Treponema pallidum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-&#173;intracellulare, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Histoplasma capsulatum, Candida</span> species, molluscum contagiosum virus, microsporidia, and &#173;others. &#173;These pathogens can infect the ocular adnexa, anterior segment, or posterior segment. Visual morbidity, however, occurs primarily with posterior segment involvement, particularly retinitis caused by CMV, herpes simplex or zoster virus, <span class="italic">T pallidum</span>, or <span class="italic">T gondii.</span></p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Cytomegalovirus Retinitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Before the availability of potent antiretroviral treatment regimens, disseminated CMV infection was the most common opportunistic infection in &#173;people with AIDS, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal infection was its most clinically impor&#173;tant manifestation, occurring in up to 40% of patients with AIDS. CMV retinitis is found mostly in the eyes of individuals with CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> counts of 50 cells/µL or less. It is now uncommon in areas where potent combination antiretroviral therapy is available and is an increasing prob&#173;lem in the resource-&#173;limited world, particularly in Southeast Asia. Even so, it remains the most common opportunistic ocular infection in patients with AIDS and occasionally is the first AIDS-&#173;defining infection found in an individual. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span> for a full discussion of CMV retinitis.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Immune recovery uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Immune recovery uveitis (IRU) is an inflammatory pro&#173;cess that affects patients with AIDS who previously had CMV retinitis and whose immune status improves with combination antiretroviral therapy. Immune recovery uveitis was defined as an increase in CD4<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> <br />T-&#173;lymphocyte count of at least 50 cells/µL to the level of 100 cells/µL. The risk &#173;factors for developing inflammation depend on the extent of CMV retinitis (CMV retinitis surface area of 25% or more), amount of intraocular CMV antigen, degree of immune constitution, and previous treatment (higher in patients treated with cidofovir). Manifestations of IRU include anterior uveitis, vitritis, uveitic macular edema, epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane formation, papillitis, neovascularization of the optic disc or ret&#173;ina and &#173;others. Vitreous inflammation may be transient, but some patients may need short courses of systemic or periocular corticosteroids. The risk of recurrent CMV retinitis should be weighed against the benefit of local ste&#173;roid injections.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-6">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment occurs in up to 50% of patients with CMV retinitis. It may occur during active disease or &#173;after successful treatment. With potent antiretroviral regimens available, the rate of ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment has been reduced to 0.06 per patient-&#173;year. Risk &#173;factors for developing ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment include involvement of all 3 ret&#173;i&#173;nal zones, lower CD4<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-2">+</span> T-&#173;lymphocyte count, and more extensive retinitis. Since &#173;there is extensive ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis and multiple posterior holes, most of &#173;these detachments require pars plana vitrectomy with long-term silicone oil tamponade. Anatomical reattachment can be achieved in 90% of patients.</p>

			<p class="h2">Necrotizing Herpetic Retinitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with AIDS may develop necrotizing herpetic retinitis, which appears to manifest as a spectrum of disease; the severity is directly proportional to the level of immunologic compromise. Patients may develop typical acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis or progressive outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis (PORN; see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span>). In its early stages, PORN may be difficult to differentiate from peripheral CMV retinitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-2</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Toxoplasmic Retinochoroiditis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Toxoplasmosis in patients with AIDS differs from toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent patients. In general, the lesions are larger in &#173;people with AIDS, and up to 40% of cases have bilateral disease. Solitary or multifocal patterns of retinitis have been observed (<span class="xref-figure">Fig </span><span class="xref-figure">15-3</span>). A vitreous inflammatory reaction usually appears overlying the area of active retinochoroiditis, but the degree of vitreous reaction may be less than that observed in immunocompetent patients (see also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis may also be more difficult in patients with AIDS. Ocular toxoplasmosis may result from newly acquired <span class="italic">T gondii </span>infection or from reactivation of chronic infection within the ret&#173;ina and even in nonocular sites. Preexisting retinochoroidal scars may be absent. Newly acquired <span class="italic">T gondii</span> infections or dissemination from nonocular sites are the most likely &#173;causes among patients with AIDS, although reactivation of quiescent toxoplasmosis also occurs. Ocular toxoplasmosis in patients with AIDS may be difficult to distinguish from acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis, necrotizing herpetic retinitis, or syphilitic retinitis. Definitive diagnosis may require aqueous and vitreous samples for culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, the inflammatory reaction in the choroid, ret&#173;ina, and vitreous is less prominent than in patients with an intact immune system. Trophozoites and cysts can be observed in greater numbers within areas of retinitis, and <span class="italic">T gondii</span> organisms can occasionally be noted invading the choroid, a finding not pres&#173;ent in immunocompetent patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The prompt diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis is especially impor&#173;tant in patients who are immunocompromised &#173;because the condition inevitably progresses if left untreated, in contrast to the self-&#173;limiting disease in immunocompetent patients. In addition, ocular toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients may be associated with ce&#173;re&#173;bral or disseminated toxoplasmosis, an impor&#173;tant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS. For HIV-&#173;infected patients with active ocular toxoplasmosis, computer-&#173;assisted tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and consultation with specialists in infectious diseases should be pursued to rule out central ner&#173;vous system (CNS) involvement.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Antitoxoplasmic therapy with synergic combination of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, azithromycin, atovaquone, and/or clindamycin is required. Corticosteroids should be used with caution and only in the presence of&#160;appropriate antimicrobial cover &#173;because of the risk of further immunosuppression&#160;in this population. In selecting the therapeutic regimen, the physician should consider the possibility of coexisting ce&#173;re&#173;bral or disseminated toxoplasmosis as well as the toxic&#160;effects of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine on bone marrow. Continued maintenance therapy may be necessary for patients with poor immune status that is not improving.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Ocular Syphilis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Syphilis is reemerging globally, particularly in association with HIV coinfection. The clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions of ocular syphilis include scleritis; anterior, intermediate or posterior uveitis; and even optic neuritis. Patients may also experience mucocutaneous and CNS symptoms A classic manifestation of syphilis in patients with AIDS is unilateral or bilateral, pale-&#173;yellow, placoid ret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions that preferentially involve the macula (syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis). Patients with AIDS may also pres&#173;ent with discrete creamy yellow superficial ret&#173;i&#173;nal precipitates overlying areas of syphilitic retinitis as a very suggestive finding, although they can occur regardless of HIV status. In patients with AIDS, vitritis without chorioretinitis can be the first manifestation of syphilis. For discussion of other manifestations, refer to <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The course of syphilis may be more aggressive in HIV-&#173;infected patients. &#173;These patients require treatment with 18–24 million units of intravenous penicillin G administered daily for 10–14 days, followed by 2.4 million units of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G administered weekly for 3 weeks. Monitoring of results from the quantitative rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is recommended, as symptomatic disease can recur.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Multifocal Choroiditis and Systemic Dissemination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Multifocal choroidal lesions from a variety of infectious agents are found in up to 10% of patients with AIDS. Most of &#173;these lesions are caused by <span class="italic">C neoformans, P jirovecii, M tuberculosis,</span> or aty&#173;pi&#173;cal mycobacteria. &#173;Because of the profound immunosuppression, multiple infectious agents may cause simultaneous infectious multifocal choroiditis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The choroid is often a site of opportunistic disseminated infections and thus needs to be carefully examined in patients with AIDS. Multifocal choroiditis should prompt an exhaustive workup &#173;because it frequently is a sign of disseminated infection.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9"><span class="h2_italic">Pneumocystis jirovecii</span> Choroiditis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with AIDS are at greater risk for <span class="italic">P jirovecii</span> pneumonia. In rare cases, this infection can result in choroidal infiltrates that contain the microorganisms.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">P jirovecii</span> can pres&#173;ent as choroiditis that consists of slightly elevated, plaquelike, yellow-&#173;white lesions located in the choroid, with minimal vitritis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-4</span>). On fluorescein angiography, &#173;these lesions tend to be hypofluorescent in the early phase and hyperfluorescent in the &#173;later phases. If disseminated <span class="italic">P jirovecii</span> infection is suspected, an extensive examination is required by an infectious disease specialist.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of <span class="italic">P jirovecii</span> choroiditis involves a 3-&#173;week regimen of intravenous tri&#173;methoprim (20&#160;mg/kg/day) and sulfamethoxazole (100&#160;mg/kg/day) or pentamidine (4&#160;mg/kg/day). Within 3–12 weeks, most of the yellow-&#173;white lesions dis&#173;appear, leaving mild overlying pigmentary changes. Vision is usually not affected.</p>
			<p class="h2"><span class="h2_italic">Cryptococcus neoformans</span> Choroiditis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The dissemination of <span class="italic">C neoformans</span> in patients with AIDS may result in a multifocal choroiditis. Some patients with <span class="italic">C neoformans</span> choroiditis show choroidal lesions before clinical evidence of dissemination develops. More typically, <span class="italic">C neoformans</span> infection involves the cerebrospinal fluid, and &#173;there is secondary optic nerve edema as a result of increased intracranial pressure that can slowly lead to optic atrophy. Direct invasion of the optic nerve by organisms is also pos&#173;si&#173;ble and can lead to more rapid vision loss. Treatment may include amphotericin and flucytosine.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-10">External Eye Manifestations</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Other ophthalmic manifestations of AIDS include Kaposi sarcoma; molluscum contagiosum; herpes zoster ophthalmicus; and keratitis caused by vari&#173;ous viruses, protozoa, conjunctival infections, and microvascular abnormalities. All of &#173;these conditions affect mainly the anterior segment of the globe and the ocular adnexa. &#173;These conditions are also discussed in BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Ocular Adnexal Kaposi Sarcoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Human herpesvirus 8 is associated with Kaposi sarcoma. Two aggressive variants of this tumor have been described: an endemic variety especially prevalent in &#173;Kenya and Nigeria and a second variant, epidemic Kaposi sarcoma, which was first noted in renal transplant recipients and in patients with AIDS. AIDS-&#173;associated Kaposi sarcoma may be found in visceral organs (the gastrointestinal tract, lung, and liver) in up to 50% of patients. Before the availability of potent antiretroviral therapy, ocular adnexal involvement occurred in approximately 20% of patients with AIDS-&#173;associated systemic Kaposi sarcoma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 15-5</span>). Histologic investigation shows spindle cells mixed with vascular structures. Treatment of Kaposi sarcoma consists of excision, cryotherapy, radiation, or a combination of &#173;these methods and is based on the clinical stage of the tumor as well as its location and the presence or absence of disseminated lesions.</p>
			<p class="h2">Molluscum Contagiosum</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a DNA virus of the poxvirus &#173;family. The characteristic skin lesions show a small elevation with central umbilication. Molluscum contagiosum lesions in immunocompetent individuals are few, unilateral, and involve the eyelids. In patients with AIDS, however, &#173;these lesions may be numerous and bilateral. If molluscum contagiosum lesions in patients with AIDS are symptomatic or cause conjunctivitis, surgical excision may be necessary.</p>
			<p class="h2">Herpes Zoster</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;People younger than 50&#160;years of age who pres&#173;ent with herpes zoster lesions of the face or eyelids should be considered for HIV testing. Corneal involvement can cause a per&#173;sis&#173;tent, chronic epithelial keratitis. Treatment consists of systemic and topical acyclovir. &#173;These patients should receive periodic monitoring with ret&#173;i&#173;nal examinations to ensure that posterior segment involvement does not occur.</p>
			<p class="h2">Other Infections</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infection with HIV does not appear to predispose patients to bacterial keratitis, although bacterial and fungal keratitis can occur in patients with AIDS who have no obvious predisposing &#173;factors such as trauma or topical corticosteroid use. Infections appear to be more severe and are more likely to cause corneal perforation in patients with AIDS than in immunocompetent patients. Similarly, herpes simplex keratitis does not appear to have a higher incidence in patients with AIDS, but it may have a prolonged course or multiple recurrences and involve the limbus. Microsporidia have been shown to cause a coarse, punctate epithelial keratitis with minimal conjunctival reaction in patients with AIDS (<span class="xref-figure">Fig </span><span class="xref-figure">15-6</span>). Electron microscopy of epithelial scrapings has revealed the organism, which is an obligate, intracellular, protozoal parasite.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Solitary granulomatous conjunctivitis caused by cryptococcal or mycotic infections or by tuberculosis can occur in HIV-&#173;infected persons. The possibility of dissemination must be aggressively investigated and, if pres&#173;ent, treated. Both orbital and intraocular lymphomas have been described in patients with AIDS.</p>
