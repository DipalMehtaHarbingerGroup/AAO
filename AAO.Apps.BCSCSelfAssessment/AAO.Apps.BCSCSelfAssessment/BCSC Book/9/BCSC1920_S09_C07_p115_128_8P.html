			<div id="Chapt7_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Scleritis, inflammation of the sclera, is a typically painful, destructive condition that carries a potential risk of permanent ocular structural damage with visual compromise. Scleritis often manifests with an acute episode of marked ocular pain, swelling, and redness. It can also evolve with decreased vision, mainly in the presence of necrotizing disease or when inflammation involves the posterior sclera, threatening the central choroid and ret&#173;ina. Scleritis can be immune mediated or can be associated with infection, trauma, surgery, and medi&#173;cations. Approximately 40% of scleritis cases are associated with a systemic disease, especially rheumatoid arthritis. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical, as scleral inflammation can be the first sign of a treatable sight- or life-&#173;threatening disease.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Classification of Scleritis</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Scleral inflammation is classified based on the site (anterior vs posterior), severity (nec&#173;rotizing vs nonnecrotizing), and pattern of scleral inflammation (diffuse vs nodular). This classification system is useful in the clinical setting, helping to predict the clinical course, systemic disease association, treatment, and prognosis (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;7-1</span>). An under&#173;lying inflammatory systemic disorder can be identified in nearly 40% of individuals with scleritis. In &#173;those with necrotizing scleritis, this association rises to up to 50%–60%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although infrequent, the onset of features of necrotizing scleritis in a case of initially nonnecrotizing disease can occur in up to 15% of cases, prompting further investigation and adequate therapy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Similar to uveitis, scleritis can also be classified as <span class="italic">noninfectious</span> or <span class="italic">infectious.</span> The latter is frequently associated with surgery or trauma. This distinction is critical since aggressive inadvertent use of corticosteroids or immunomodulatory therapy in cases of an under&#173;lying infectious etiology can lead to devastating consequences.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Pathophysiology</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Noninfectious scleritis is an immune-&#173;mediated condition frequently involving the small blood vessels of the sclera. Pathophysiologic mechanisms vary according to the type of scleritis and under&#173;lying associated systemic disease. Onset is usually with infiltration of inflammatory cells in the sclera and episclera, mediated by proinflammatory cytokines and intercellular adhesion molecules.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diffuse anterior subtype of scleritis is associated with a nongranulomatous &#173;response involving macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, which often assume a perivascular distribution.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In nodular scleritis, and particularly in necrotizing scleritis, the inflammatory response is more significant and specific, involving direct antibody-&#173;mediated damage (type II hypersensitivity), deposition of immune complexes triggering a type III hypersensitivity reaction, or a delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity response mainly characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the sclera. Inflammation may pro&#173;gress to an essentially vasculitic response, culminating in fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall and, eventually, necrosis of the sclera, episclera, conjunctiva, and cornea. Proinflammatory cytokines and activated metalloproteinases may play a role in local scleral and corneal damage.</p>

			<p class="h1">Epidemiology</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Scleritis does not show geographic or racial differences. The incidence of scleritis is estimated at 3.4–4.1 per 100,000 persons and prevalence at 5.2 per 100,000 persons in the United States (US). Scleritis is more common in females. In tertiary centers, however, scleritis comprises 0.1%–2.6% of newly referred cases. Nonnecrotizing anterior scleritis is the most common form of the disease. While noninfectious scleritis is more common in the US, it is impor&#173;tant to consider infectious scleritis, including herpetic, nocardial, mycobacterial, and fungal infection, in patients with risk &#173;factors based on medical and surgical history and geography.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Clinical Presentation</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Individuals with scleritis usually pres&#173;ent with tenderness and dull pain in the affected eye and periocular area. The pain may worsen with eye movements and radiate to the face, cheek, and jaw. When cornea or posterior sclera is involved, vision may be affected.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The eye with scleritis typically shows scleral edema and intense hyperemia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-1</span>), leading to a characteristic violaceous hue on external examination. Slit-&#173;lamp examination characteristically discloses marked dilation of deep episcleral plexus, which is displaced outward by scleral edema/inflammatory infiltration. This is impor&#173;tant in the distinction from episcleritis, in which no scleral edema is found and only superficial episcleral plexus is affected. Careful utilization of a topical vasoconstrictor (eg, phenylephrine drops) to bleach superficial blood vessels may facilitate this assessment and help distinguish episcleritis, in which the redness would blanch with phenylephrine, from scleritis. Close biomicroscopic inspection is also very impor&#173;tant to assess the presence of signs of necrotizing disease (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-2</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Diffuse Anterior Scleritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anterior scleritis is defined as scleral inflammation anterior to the recti muscles. This is the most common and least severe type of scleritis, with a less than 10% risk of complications in most individuals. Onset is frequently insidious, with severe pain and diffuse or sectoral deep episcleral vascular congestion. Scleral swelling/infiltration is more diffuse (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-1</span>), so that no nodule is formed. Recurrences are very common. The main systemic associations include rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and relapsing polychondritis. Inflammatory bowel disease, reactive arthritis, and, less frequently, ankylosing spondylitis can also be implicated.</p>
			<p class="h2">Nodular Anterior Scleritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Features of nodular anterior scleritis include a tender and typically immobile scleral nodule, in addition to the local or diffuse violaceous hue associated with markedly engorged, deep episcleral vessels. Up to 10% of patients with nodular anterior scleritis initially can pro&#173;gress to necrotizing disease, particularly in the setting of an under&#173;lying systemic inflammatory condition. It is impor&#173;tant to rule out infectious etiologies in cases of nodular anterior scleritis, especially in the presence of necrosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-3</span>). This necrotic change often manifests as an avascular area in the center of the nodule (eventually with superficial ulceration) or as a new in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent lesion, extending circumferentially. &#173;After resolution of scleral inflammation, increased scleral translucency may be seen, eventually with thinning (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-4</span>) and even formation of a staphyloma.</p>
			<p class="h2">Necrotizing Scleritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Necrotizing scleritis is the most severe and destructive type of scleral scleritis and is more likely to lead to vision loss. It is more frequently associated with systemic disease (approximately 50%–60%), some being life-&#173;threatening systemic vasculitic diseases. Necrotizing scleritis more frequently affects older individuals and is more prevalent in &#173;women. In the past, patients with necrotizing scleritis suffered from mortality rates as high as 30%; however, this improved significantly with the evolution of biologic therapies. Necrotizing scleritis can be further subdivided into 2 groups: (1) necrotizing scleritis with inflammation and (2) necrotizing scleritis without (overt) inflammation (scleromalacia perforans)<span class="italic">.</span></p>

			<p class="h3">Necrotizing scleritis with inflammation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Necrotizing scleritis with inflammation is characterized by overt signs and symptoms of scleral inflammation. It may be subdivided into 3 types: (1) vaso-&#173;occlusive, (2) granulomatous (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-5</span>), and (3) postsurgical.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The vaso-&#173;occlusive type progressively displays plaques of nonperfusion of episclera/conjunctiva, associated with scleral edema/infiltration and severe congestion of adjacent episcleral/conjunctival vessels (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-6</span>). The limbal area and peripheral cornea are often spared. &#173;These cases are usually associated with infection or with an under&#173;lying systemic immune-&#173;mediated disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The granulomatous type typically starts with necrotizing inflammation of the limbal area, further extending anteriorly to the cornea and posteriorly to the sclera. The inflamed area assumes a “lumpy” aspect, associated with inflammatory infiltration and edema. Subsequently, necrosis and ulceration of the affected tissues (cornea, conjunctiva, episclera, and sclera) develop. This granulomatous type is frequently associated with systemic vasculitides, particularly granulomatosis with polyangiitis and polyarteritis nodosa. It is impor&#173;tant to note that other subtypes of necrotizing scleritis may also display granulomatous inflammation on histopathology.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The postsurgical type is rare but frequently arises a few months to several years &#173;after surgical trauma to the sclera. It may be infectious or noninfectious. Procedures associated with postsurgical scleritis include cataract, strabismus or ret&#173;i&#173;nal surgery, trabeculectomy, cryotherapy, and pterygium excision, the last especially with use of mitomycin C or beta &#173;radiation. Recalcitrant inflammation, with progressive necrosis of the sclera, develops commonly at the site of the surgical insult (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-7</span>), or sometimes more distant to the surgical incision. Many of &#173;these patients have an under&#173;lying autoimmune disease, with scleral surgical injury being the pos&#173;si&#173;ble trigger for the local inflammatory pro&#173;cess. It is impor&#173;tant to exclude infection in &#173;these cases.</p>

			<p class="h3">Necrotizing scleritis without (overt) inflammation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Necrotizing scleritis without (overt) inflammation, also called <span class="italic">scleromalacia perforans,</span> is characterized by lack of significant symptoms and apparent signs of clinical scleral inflammation. On histopathology, however, &#173;there is inflammatory cell infiltration in the sclera. The necrotizing granulomatous response leads to progressive (and “&#173;silent”) destruction of the scleral tissue, which may extend circumferentially, eventually leaving a staphyloma. This entity has been historically misnamed <span class="italic">scleritis without inflammation.</span> Patients with <span class="italic">scleroma</span><span class="italic">lacia perforans</span> are often el&#173;derly &#173;women with long-&#173;standing rheumatoid arthritis. They typically pres&#173;ent with yellowish or white necrotic scleral plaques involving the sclera and episclera (sequestrum) of both eyes. &#173;These plaques are surrounded by mildly dilated episcleral vessels. Associated staphylomata are covered by conjunctiva and a thin translucent layer of fibrous tissue (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-8</span>). Despite the term “perforans,” &#173;these lesions do not usually perforate spontaneously.</p>
			<p class="h2">Posterior Scleritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Posterior scleritis is a sight-&#173;threatening entity that is defined by inflammation posterior to the ora serrata. It may be difficult to recognize &#173;because of lack of inflammatory signs in the anterior part of the sclera &#173;unless it is concomitant to anterior scleritis. The rate of association with inflammatory systemic conditions is comparable to that of anterior scleritis. Patients often report severe deep, boring pain and tenderness to palpation, but in 30%–40% of patients, &#173;these symptoms may be mild or absent. Decreased vision is often reported, but also depends on the topography of scleral inflammation and involvement of under&#173;lying structures. Pos&#173;si&#173;ble signs include choroidal detachment and folds, subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid, and optic disc edema (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-9</span>). Anterior rotation of the ciliary body pars plicata can displace the iridolenticular diaphragm anteriorly, leading to angle closure and acute elevation of intraocular pressure. Involvement of extraocular muscles (myositis) occasionally leads to diplopia.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Infectious Scleritis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A wide variety of agents can infect the sclera, including <span class="italic">Pseudomonas</span> organisms (most common &#173;after pterygium excision), <span class="italic">Actinomyces</span> and <span class="italic">Nocardia</span> species, mycobacteria, fungi such as <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> and <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> species, and gram-&#173;positive cocci (<span class="italic">Staphylococcus pneumococcus</span> and <span class="italic">Streptococcus</span> species). In addition, herpes simplex virus and varicella-&#173;zoster virus can cause chronic infectious scleritis. Infectious scleritis can occur &#173;after any previous ocular surgery, including pterygium surgery (especially when beta radiation or mitomycin C is used), scleral buckling, cataract surgery, and pars plana vitrectomy. Trauma with a penetrating injury contaminated by soil or vegetable &#173;matter may also result in infectious scleritis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Infectious scleritis can pres&#173;ent with pain, redness, and decreased vision, as with noninfectious scleritis. Nodular and necrotizing scleral disease are more common in this setting, and patients may also have intraocular inflammation (sclerouveitis) that is disproportionately more significant than that seen in noninfectious scleritis. A precipitating surgery may be recent or remote (in rare cases, many years before). The sclera appears necrotic, thin, and avascular, with inflammation at the edges (<span class="xref-figure">see Fig 7-3</span>), usually at the site of a surgical or traumatic wound. A mucopurulent discharge may be pres&#173;ent, depending on the infectious agent.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-10">Diagnosis</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diagnosis of scleritis is based on a detailed clinical history, close inspection, and slit-&#173;lamp and fundus examination. Sometimes it may be easier to appreciate scleritis by looking at the eye externally without the slit lamp. Complementary B-&#173;scan ultrasonography, fundus angiography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can help better delineate scleral involvement. An appropriate laboratory workup is warranted to rule out under&#173;lying systemic inflammatory diseases (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;7-2</span>), which may be very frequent and life-&#173;threatening, especially in the setting of necrotizing scleritis. Fi&#173;nally, it is impor&#173;tant to consider the possibility of drug-&#173;induced scleral inflammation (mainly associated with bisphosphonates).</p>
			<p class="body-text">B-&#173;scan ultrasonography is useful for confirming suspicion of posterior scleritis or assessing concomitant posterior scleral involvement. Imaging typically reveals thickening of the sclera, associated with accumulation of fluid in the sub-&#173;Tenon space. When adjacent to the optic nerve shadow, this may lead to the classic “T-&#173;sign” (see Fig 7-9). &#173;Ultrasonography may also be helpful to assess involvement of adjacent structures, including the choroid, ciliary body, ret&#173;ina, extraocular muscles, and orbit. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also assist in the assessment of orbital structures in posterior scleritis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Posterior segment spectral-&#173;domain optical coherence tomography (SD-&#173;OCT), including enhanced depth imaging (EDI), may also be useful to delineate fundus changes associated with posterior scleritis (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 7-9</span>). Anterior segment SD-&#173;OCT may provide noninvasive imaging that documents local changes at the level of the sclera, episclera, Tenon capsule, conjunctiva, cornea, and &#173;angle structures, but its clinical utility is unclear at this time. Ultrasound biomicroscopy may be used to image the anterior segment and ciliary body, but this technique is often technically cumbersome in tender and painful eyes with scleritis. In cases of posterior scleritis, fundus fluorescein or indocyanine angiography can identify the extent of disease and may be helpful in differential diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the setting of high suspicion for infectious scleritis, microbiological examination of scleral scrape and even incisional biopsy of the sclera can be very helpful. Biopsy is also valuable in the possibility of neoplastic conditions, such as conjunctival carcinomas and lymphomas. &#173;These can masquerade as or even be associated with a variable degree of scleral inflammation. Intraocular tumors, particularly large uveal melanomas, occasionally lead to engorgement of overlying episcleral (so-&#173;called <span class="italic">sentinel)</span> vessels.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-10">Treatment</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of scleritis depends on the type and extent of scleral inflammation and the results of diagnostic investigations (see <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;7-2</span>). In the presence of an under&#173;lying systemic disease, particularly associated with necrotizing scleritis, adequate control of the condition is essential, as it may be a major determinant of mortality. It is also impor&#173;tant to manage infectious and neoplastic etiologies accordingly.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Systemic Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topical therapy is usually not sufficient to treat scleritis; therefore, treatment is systemic. It can range from oral nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to systemic immunomodulatory agents. In individuals with mild-&#173;to-&#173;moderate noninfectious anterior scleritis, &#173;either diffuse or nodular, primary management consists of oral NSAIDs for a few weeks, in the absence of specific contraindications. Caution is advised &#173;because of the risk of gastroduodenal ulceration, which may be decreased by concomitant use of histamine-&#173;H<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span> receptor antagonists or proton-&#173;pump inhibitors. It is also impor&#173;tant to monitor renal function closely.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Severe noninfectious cases, refractory to NSAIDs or with posterior or necrotizing disease, are managed with systemic corticosteroids, typically with an initial dose of 1&#160;mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent, followed by a slow tapering regimen. Careful monitoring for side effects is highly recommended.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When scleral inflammation recurs or is refractory to systemic corticosteroids, especially in necrotizing scleritis, immunomodulatory drugs (mainly antimetabolites, such as methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine) are indicated either as corticosteroid-&#173;sparing agents or as adjuvants. Biologic immunomodulatory agents,&#160;such as&#160;tumor necrosis &#173;factor inhibitors (eg, infliximab, adalimumab, and rituximab [anti-CD20]), have also been successfully employed for refractory cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intravenous pulse therapy with methylprednisolone (1&#160;g daily for 3 days, followed by high-&#173;dose oral prednisone) can be initially used in the setting of severe necrotizing or nonnecrotizing scleritis. Alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide, are reserved for severe necrotizing involvement of the sclera and cornea, with impending risk of perforation. They may also be helpful for the control of under&#173;lying systemic diseases (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Scleritis associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener granulomatosis) and polyarteritis nodosa typically requires more aggressive therapy with rituximab or cyclophosphamide.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Infectious scleritis can be treated with systemic (and topical) antimicrobials and surgical debridement as needed. It is impor&#173;tant to differentiate infectious scleritis from noninfectious scleritis, &#173;because unopposed corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents can worsen scleritis in the presence of active infection. Microorganisms may be difficult to eradicate from the sclera, and long-&#173;term treatment may be necessary. Scleral patch grafting may be necessary, if &#173;there is severe thinning.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Individuals with nonnecrotizing noninfectious scleritis who cannot tolerate systemic therapy or have residual scleral inflammation may be candidates for subconjunctival injection of low-&#173;dose subconjunctival triamcinolone (0.5–4&#160;mg). It is impor&#173;tant for each case to weigh the risks of cataract and secondary ocular hypertension/glaucoma and, more remotely, of scleral melting and infection against the pos&#173;si&#173;ble benefits of the injection. Under&#173;lying systemic inflammatory diseases should be &#173;under control and infectious etiologies must be ruled out before considering local injection of ste&#173;roids.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Surgical Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Surgical treatment can be considered in individuals with severe refractory necrotizing scleritis to reinforce the wall in the setting of an impending perforation or to close a spontaneous or traumatic corneal and/or scleral defect (tectonic grafting). <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;7-10</span> shows a postoperative aspect of scleral grafting. Cadaveric donor sclera may be used for grafting, but it can melt. Consequently, some authors have recommended use of autogenous periosteum or donor cornea. In cases of infectious scleritis, scleral debridement can be considered in addition to antibiotics.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-13">Prognosis</p>
			<div id="Chapt7_Top9">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The prognosis of scleritis varies upon the severity and extent of involvement of ocular structures and the presence of under&#173;lying systemic diseases. Nonnecrotizing noninfectious anterior (diffuse or nodular) scleritis has a good prognosis with treatment, with most eyes maintaining good visual acuity over time. Patients with posterior scleritis, necrotizing scleritis, or infectious scleritis, however, are at high risk of permanent vision loss. Individuals with necrotizing scleritis are also at risk of higher mortality rates, &#173;because of the frequent association with life-&#173;threatening vasculitic disorders. Proper and timely management of &#173;these disorders is thus very impor&#173;tant.</p>
