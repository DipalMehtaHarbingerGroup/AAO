			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The concept that many organs and tissue sites possess modifications to the classic immune response arc is called <span class="italic">regional immunity.</span> Regional immunity can affect all 3 phases of the response arc—&#173;afferent, pro&#173;cessing, and effector. Regional differences in immune response occur &#173;because of differences in the immunologic microenvironments of vari&#173;ous tissue sites. &#173;These regional differences can occur down to the level of specific locations within and around the eye (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;3-1</span>), such as the</p>

			<p class="body-text">A unique feature of the microenvironment of the eye is termed the <span class="italic">ocular immune privilege</span>. The term was introduced in 1940s by the finding that foreign antigen introduction to the anterior chamber did not elicit inflammatory response. Immune privilege is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation to protect vital structures. Traditionally, central ner&#173;vous system, eyes, and testicles are considered immune-&#173;privileged organs.</p>

			<p class="h1">Immune Responses of the Conjunctiva</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Features of the Immunologic Microenvironment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The conjunctiva shares many of the features typical of mucosal sites. It is well vascularized and has good lymphatic drainage to preauricular and submandibular nodes. The tissue contains numerous Langerhans cells, other dendritic cells, and macrophages that serve as potential antigen-&#173;presenting cells (APCs). Conjunctival follicles that enlarge &#173;after certain types of ocular surface infection or inflammation represent collections of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and APCs. By analogy with similar sites, such as Peyer patches of the intestine, &#173;these follicles are likely sites for localized immune pro&#173;cessing of antigens that permeate through the thin overlying epithelium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The conjunctiva, especially the substantia propria, is richly populated with potential effector cells, predominately mast cells. All antibody isotypes are represented, with IgA as the most abundant type in the tear film. Local antibody production presumably occurs as well as passive leakage. Soluble molecules of the innate immune system, especially complement, are also pres&#173;ent. The conjunctiva appears to support most adaptive and innate immune effector responses, especially antibody-&#173;mediated and lymphocyte-&#173;mediated responses, although IgE-&#173;mediated mast-&#173;cell degranulation is one of the most common and impor&#173;tant. See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;8</span>, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> for further information on conjunctival immune responses.</p>
			<p class="h2">Immunoregulatory Systems</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The conjunctiva contains <span class="italic">mucosa-&#173;associated lymphoid tissue</span> (MALT), an interconnected network of mucosal sites in the body (the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract, gut, and genitourinary tract, and the ocular surface and its adnexae) that share certain immunologic features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">large number of APCs</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">specialized structures for localized antigen pro&#173;cessing</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">unique effector cells (eg, intraepithelial T lymphocytes and abundant mast cells)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The most distinctive feature of MALT is the homing of effector T and B lymphocytes to all MALT sites &#173;after immunization at one site. This migration occurs &#173;because of the shared expression of specific cell-&#173;adhesion molecules on postcapillary venules of the mucosal vasculature. MALT immune response arcs &#173;favor T helper-2 (Th2)–&#173;dominated responses that result in the production of predominantly immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgE antibodies. Pro&#173;cessing of soluble antigens through MALT, especially in the gut sites, often produces immune tolerance, presumably by activating Th2-&#173;like regulatory T lymphocytes that suppress T helper-1 (Th1)–&#173;delayed hypersensitivity (DH) effector cells.</p>

			<p class="h1">Immune Responses of the Cornea</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Features of the Immunologic Microenvironment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cornea is unique in that the peripheral and central portions of the tissue represent distinctly dif&#173;fer&#173;ent immunologic microenvironments. In normal eyes, only the limbus is vascularized and richly invested with Langerhans cells. The paracentral and central cornea are normally devoid of APCs and are avascular. Vari&#173;ous stimuli, such as mild trauma, certain cytokines (eg, interleukin-1), or infection, can recruit APCs to the central cornea. Plasma-&#173;derived proteins (eg, complement, IgM, and IgG) are pres&#173;ent in moderate concentrations in the periphery, but only low levels of IgM are pres&#173;ent centrally.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Corneal cells also appear to synthesize vari&#173;ous antimicrobial and immunoregulatory proteins. Effector cells are absent or scarce in the normal cornea, but neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes can readily migrate through the stroma if appropriate chemotactic stimuli are activated. Lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils can also adhere to the endothelial surface during inflammation, giving rise to keratic precipitates or the classic Khodadoust line of endothelial rejection (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-1</span>). Localized immune pro&#173;cessing prob&#173;ably does not occur in the cornea. See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;8</span>, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Immunoregulatory Systems</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The cornea demonstrates a form of immune privilege dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from that observed in the anterior uvea. Immune privilege of the cornea is multifactorial. Normal limbal physiology is a major component, especially the maintenance of avascularity and lack of APCs in the mid-&#173; and central cornea. The absence of APCs and lymphatic channels partially inhibits afferent recognition in the central cornea. The absence of postcapillary venules centrally can limit the efficiency of effector recruitment, although effector cells and molecules can infiltrate even avascular cornea. Another &#173;factor is the presence of intact immunoregulatory systems of the anterior chamber to which the corneal endothelium is exposed. Fi&#173;nally, effector blockade likely provides relative immune privilege to the cornea. (See <span class="xref-sidebar">Clinical Example 3-1</span>.)</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Immune Responses of the Anterior Chamber, Anterior Uvea, and Vitreous</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Features of the Immunologic Microenvironment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The anterior chamber is a fluid-&#173;filled cavity; circulating aqueous humor provides a unique medium for intercellular communication among cytokines, immune cells, and resident tissue cells of the iris, ciliary body, and corneal endothelium. Although aqueous humor is relatively protein depleted compared with serum (containing about 0.1%–1.0% of the total serum protein concentration), even normal aqueous humor contains a complex mixture of biological &#173;factors, such as immunomodulatory cytokines, neuropeptides, and complement inhibitors that influence immunologic events within the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A partial blood–&#173;ocular barrier is pres&#173;ent. Fenestrated capillaries in the ciliary body allow a size-&#173;dependent concentration gradient of plasma macromolecules to permeate the interstitial tissue. Smaller plasma-&#173;derived molecules are pres&#173;ent in higher concentration than larger molecules. The tight junctions between the pigmented and nonpigmented ciliary epithelium provide a more exclusive barrier, preventing interstitial macromolecules from permeating directly through the ciliary body into the aqueous humor. Nevertheless, a small number of plasma macromolecules bypass the nonpigmented epithelium barrier. They can permeate by diffusion anteriorly through the uvea to enter the anterior chamber through the anterior iris surface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Few resident T lymphocytes and some mast cells are pres&#173;ent in the normal anterior uvea. B lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils are normally not pres&#173;ent. Very low concentrations of IgG and complement components occur in normal aqueous humor. The iris and ciliary body contain significant numbers of macrophages and dendritic cells that serve as APCs and pos&#173;si&#173;ble effector cells. Immune pro&#173;cessing is unlikely to occur locally. Rather, &#173;because the inner eye does not contain well-&#173;defined lymphatic channels, clearance of soluble substances depends on aqueous humor outflow channels; clearance of particulates depends on endocytosis by trabecular meshwork endothelial cells or macrophages. Nevertheless, antigen inoculation into the anterior chamber results in efficient communication with the systemic immune response. Intact soluble antigens gain entrance to the venous circulation, through which they are transported to the spleen.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The vitreous has not been studied as extensively as the anterior chamber. Studies employing proteomics reveal the vitreous as a physiologically active, complex tissue containing diverse proteins originating from inside and outside the eye. An impor&#173;tant source for &#173;these inflammatory mediators is the ret&#173;ina. The vitreous gel can also electrostatically bind charged protein substances and can serve as an antigen depot as well as a substrate for leukocyte cell adhesion. Hyalocytes are modified resident macrophages. They are impor&#173;tant in vitreal immunoregulation/modulation and frequently act as antigen-&#173;presenting cells. They also respond to dif&#173;fer&#173;ent cytokines, playing a role in the immunopathogenesis of several disorders, including proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). &#173;Because the vitreous contains collagen type II, it may also serve as a depot of potential autoantigen.</p>
			<p class="h2">Immunoregulatory Systems</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Relatively mild degrees of inflammation that would be harmless in the skin, for example, can cause severe vision loss if they occur in the eye. A variety of immunoregulatory mechanisms have thus evolved to modulate intraocular immune responses (eg, immune privilege).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular immune privilege has been observed with vari&#173;ous antigens, including alloantigens (eg, transplantation antigens), tumor antigens, haptens, soluble proteins, autoantigens, bacteria, and viruses. The best-&#173;studied model of immune privilege in the eye is called <span class="italic">anterior chamber–&#173;associated immune deviation</span> (ACAID). Whereas subcutaneous immunization with antigen elicits a strong, delayed-&#173;type sensitivity, immunization into the anterior chamber with the identical antigen results in a robust antibody response but a virtual absence of delayed-&#173;type hypersensitivity. In fact, preexisting delayed-&#173;type hypersensitivity (DH) can be suppressed by the ACAID response.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ACAID response represents an attenuated effector arc. &#173;There are other regulators that contribute to immune privilege of the eye. The eye is further protected from severe inflammation by another modulating system termed <span class="italic">effector blockade,</span> by which Th1 lymphocytes, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natu&#173;ral killer cells, and complement activation appear to function less effectively in the anterior uvea than elsewhere. For instance, the anterior uvea is <span class="italic">relatively</span> resistant to induction of a secondary purified protein derivative DH response &#173;after primary immunization with mycobacteria in the skin. &#173;There are several mechanisms of effector blockade, but one of the most impor&#173;tant and best studied involves the <span class="italic">Fas ligand</span> (FasL, or CD95 ligand). The FasL is constitutively expressed on the iris and corneal endothelium. It is a potent trigger of programmed cell death, or <span class="italic">apoptosis,</span> of lymphocytes expressing the Fas receptor. Thus, even if an immune response develops to an ocular antigen, the inflammation can be downregulated by this mechanism of effector blockade.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Note that the immunoregulatory environment can, however, be overcome by sufficient immune stimulation.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Immune Responses of the Retina, Retinal Pigment Epithelium, Choriocapillaris, and Choroid</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top6">
			<p class="h2-h1">Features of the Immunologic Microenvironment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The immunologic microenvironments of the ret&#173;ina, RPE, choriocapillaris, and choroid have not been well characterized. The ret&#173;i&#173;nal circulation establishes an inner blood–&#173;ocular barrier at the level of tight junctions between adjacent endothelial cells, while tight junctions between the cells of the RPE provide an outer barrier between the choroid and the ret&#173;ina. The vessels of the choriocapillaris are highly permeable to macromolecules and allow transudation of most plasma macromolecules into the extravascular spaces of the choroid and choriocapillaris. Well-&#173;developed lymphatic channels are absent, although both the ret&#173;ina and the choroid have abundant potential APCs. In the ret&#173;ina, resident microglia (bone marrow–&#173;derived cells related to dendritic cells) are interspersed within all layers and can undergo physical changes and migration in response to vari&#173;ous stimuli. The choriocapillaris and choroid contain an abundance of certain potential APCs, especially macrophages and dendritic cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The RPE can be induced to express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, suggesting that the RPE may interact with T lymphocytes in some circumstances. The presence of T lymphocytes or B lymphocytes within the normal posterior segment has not been carefully studied, but effector cells appear to be absent from the normal ret&#173;ina. Similar to macrophages, RPE cells also express toll-&#173;like receptors (TLRs). &#173;These special pattern recognition receptors are critical in recognition of pathogens and in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses, forming an initial line of defense against invading microorganisms. A moderate density of mast cells is also pres&#173;ent in the choroid, especially around the arterioles, but lymphocytes are pres&#173;ent only in very low number. Eosinophils and neutrophils appear to be absent. &#173;Under vari&#173;ous clinical or experimental conditions, however, a large number of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils can infiltrate the choroid, choriocapillaris, and ret&#173;ina. The RPE and vari&#173;ous cell types within the ret&#173;ina and the choroid (eg, pericytes) can synthesize many dif&#173;fer&#173;ent cytokines (eg, transforming growth factor-&#173;<span class="greek">β</span>) that may alter the subsequent immune response. Local immune pro&#173;cessing does not seem to occur.

			<p class="h2">Immunoregulatory Systems</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A form of immune privilege, likely similar to ACAID, is pres&#173;ent &#173;after subret&#173;i&#173;nal injection of antigen. Iris, ciliary body, and RPE cells all contribute to immune homeostasis of the eye that is mediated by soluble or membrane-bound molecules. This observation may be impor&#173;tant &#173;because of growing interest in ret&#173;i&#173;nal transplantation, stem cell therapies, and gene therapy. (See <span class="xref-sidebar">Clinical Example 3-2</span>.) The RPE can limit activation of T cells and convert effector cells to regulatory cells. The capacity of the choriocapillaris and choroid to function as unique environments for the afferent or effector phases has not yet been evaluated.</p>

					<p class="sidebar-h2 ParaOverride-1"><span class="sidebar-h2">Corneal allograft rejection</span> Penetrating keratoplasty, or the transplantation of corneal allografts, has an extremely high success rate (<span class="sidebar-h2_symbol">&gt;</span>90%) even in the absence of systemic immunomodulation. This rate is substantially superior to ac&#173;cep&#173;tance rates &#173;after transplantation of other donor tissues. The mechanisms of corneal graft survival have been attributed to immune privilege. In experimental models, &#173;factors contributing to rejection include the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-first">presence of central corneal vascularization</li>
						<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">induction of MHC molecule expression, which is normally low, by the stroma</li>
						<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">contamination of the donor graft with donor-&#173;derived APCs prior to transplantation</li>
						<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-mid">MHC disparity between the host and the donor</li>
						<li class="sidebar-bullet-list-last">preimmunization of the recipient to donor transplantation antigens</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="sidebar-text">Loss of the immunoregulatory systems of the anterior chamber can influence corneal allograft immunity, and the expression of FasL on corneal endothelium has been observed to be essential for allograft protection in animal models. Rapid replacement of donor epithelium by host epithelium removes this layer as an antigenic stimulus. Once activated, however, antibody-&#173;dependent DH and CTL-&#173;related mechanisms can target transplantation antigens in all corneal layers.</p>

					<p class="sidebar-h2 ParaOverride-1"><span class="sidebar-h2">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal gene therapy</span> Ret&#173;i&#173;nal gene therapy is the intentional transfection of neural ret&#173;ina cells or RPE with a replication-&#173;defective virus that has been genet&#173;ically altered to carry a replacement gene of choice. This gene becomes expressed in any cell infected by the virus. Immune clearance of the virus can cause loss of expression of the transferred gene in&#160;other body sites. Applications of gene therapy in &#173;humans have been successfully completed. The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved treatment of biallelic <span class="sidebar-h2_italic">RPE65</span> mutation–&#173;associated ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophy (Leber congenital amaurosis) using adeno-&#173;associated virus (AAV) vector to replace the defective <span class="sidebar-h2_italic">RPE65</span> gene. The agent (voretigene neparvovec-&#173;rzyl) is administered via subret&#173;i&#173;nal injection. Despite the relative immune privilege of the eye, immunogenicity of viral vectors is an ongoing area of investigation. In animal models, intravitreal delivery has lead to a humoral response, while subret&#173;i&#173;nal delivery has not. Intraocular inflammation was observed in approximately 5% of patients receiving &#173;voretigene neparvovec-&#173;rzy. Use of systemic corticosteroids is recommended, starting 3 days prior to injection of voretigene neparvovec-&#173;rzyl. Ocular injection of AAV for the treatment of vari&#173;ous inherited ret&#173;i&#173;nal &#173;dystrophies is &#173;under investigation. Areas of study include achromatopsia, choroide&#173;remia, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, X-&#173;linked retinoschisis, and X-&#173;linked retinitis pigmentosa.</p>
