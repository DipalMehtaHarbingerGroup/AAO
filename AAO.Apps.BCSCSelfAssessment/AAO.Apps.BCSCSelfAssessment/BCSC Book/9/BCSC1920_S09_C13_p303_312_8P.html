			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Primary Vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal Lymphoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Primary vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal lymphoma is a subset of primary central ner&#173;vous system lymphoma (PCNSL). It is an uncommon, but potentially fatal malignancy, which may occur with or without CNS lesions. The usual age of onset is in the 50s and 60s, &#173;there is no &#173;convincing gender predilection, and immunosuppressed patients are at greater risk. Nearly all (98%) cases of PVRL are non-&#173;Hodgkin B-&#173;lymphocyte lymphomas. Approximately 2% are T-&#173;lymphocyte lymphomas. The incidence of PCNSL appears to be increasing and is projected to occur in 1 of &#173;every 100,000 immunocompetent patients.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-6">Chan CC, Rubenstein JL, Coupland SE, et&#160;al. Primary vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal lymphoma: a report from an international primary central ner&#173;vous system lymphoma collaborative group symposium. <span class="reference--journal-_italic">Oncologist</span>. 2011;16(11):1589–1599.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical features and findings</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">More than two-&#173;thirds of patients with PVRL &#173;will develop CNS disease—&#173;usually within 29 months of diagnosis. About 25% of patients with intracranial lymphoma &#173;will develop intraocular disease. Sites of ocular involvement can include the vitreous, ret&#173;ina, subret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (sub-&#173;RPE), and any combination thereof. The most common presenting symptoms are decreased vision and floaters.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Examination reveals a variable degree of vitritis and anterior chamber cells. Posterior segment involvement can appear as creamy yellow subret&#173;i&#173;nal infiltrates with overlying RPE detachments (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-1</span>) and discrete white lesions that may mimic acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis, toxoplasmosis, “frosted-branch” angiitis, or ret&#173;i&#173;nal arteriolar obstruction with coexisting multifocal chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal scars (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 13-2, 13-3</span>) and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis. The lesions vary in thickness from approximately 1&#160;mm to 2&#160;mm. &#173;Because of diagnostic difficulty, often patients are already being treated with vari&#173;ous anti-&#173;inflammatory medi&#173;cations that temporarily can improve the vitreous cellular infiltration, but the effect is not long-&#173;lasting. Central ner&#173;vous system signs may be pres&#173;ent and vary in nature from behavioral changes, hemiparesis, and cerebellar signs to epileptic seizures and cranial nerve palsies.</p>
			<p class="h3">Diagnostic testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ultrasonography may indicate vitreous debris, elevated subret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions, and serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Fluorescein angiography may show hypofluorescent areas due to blockage from a sub-&#173;RPE tumor mass or from RPE clumping. Hyperfluorescent win&#173;dow defects may also be caused by RPE atrophy from resolved RPE infiltration. An unusual leopard-&#173;spot pattern of alternating hyperfluorescence and hypofluorescence may also be noted. Granular autofluorescence (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-1</span>) and nodular elevations at the level of the RPE/sub-&#173;RPE corresponding to &#173;these areas can also be helpful in the diagnosis. Indocyanine green angiography may show ill-&#173;defined hypofluorescent lesions at the late-&#173;phase study. Optic coherence tomography (OCT) may reveal mild irregularity of the inner/outer segments of photoreceptors and the RPE/Bruch membrane complex.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All patients with suspected PVRL should be evaluated for CNS lymphoma even in the absence of neurologic symptoms. With CNS involvement, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain show isointense lesions on T1-&#173;weighted images and isointense to hyperintense lesions on T2-&#173;weighted images. Computed tomography (CT) without use of contrast shows multiple diffuse periventricular lesions. If intravenous contrast is used with CT, &#173;these periventricular lesions may be enhanced. Cerebrospinal fluid analy&#173;sis reveals lymphoma cells in one-&#173;third of patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The presence of vitreous cells in cases of uveitis that do not respond to therapy necessitates a vitreous biopsy. Ideally, at least 1&#160;mL of undiluted vitreous sample should be obtained. A ret&#173;i&#173;nal biopsy, an aspirate of sub-&#173;RPE material, or both may be considered when previous vitreous biopsy results have been negative (Video 13-1). Prior to surgery, communication with an experienced pathologist for instructions on the proper and prompt &#173;handling of the specimens is necessary to avoid degeneration of the typically friable cells that may occur with delay. Examination by a pathologist is crucial, as the diagnosis may be difficult to establish &#173;because of the frequently sparse cellularity of the specimens. Portions of the specimen are typically prepared for both cytologic examination and cell surface marker determination by flow cytometry. As many as one-&#173;third of vitreous biopsies incur a false-&#173;negative result; thus, a second biopsy of the vitreous should be performed if the clinical picture warrants.</p>

			<p class="body-text">Cytokine analy&#173;sis of vitreous samples can be helpful in supporting the diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels are elevated in the vitreous of patients with lymphoma. In contrast, high levels of IL-6 are found in the vitreous of patients with inflammatory uveitis. Thus, the ratio of IL-10 to IL-6 is often elevated in intraocular lymphoma and supports the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Gene rearrangement studies can provide evidence of monoclonality. Flow cytometry may reveal kappa (<span class="greek">κ</span>) or gamma (<span class="greek">γ</span>) chain restriction or large B-&#173;cell populations, both of which support the diagnosis of B-&#173;cell lymphoma. A specific mutation (proline for leucine substitution mutation at position 265) of the myeloid differentiation primary response 88&#160;protein (<span class="italic">MYD88</span>) is also supportive.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If diagnosis by vitreous aspiration or subret&#173;i&#173;nal aspiration cannot be established, internal or external chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal biopsy techniques may be useful in the diagnosis of PCNSL.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Histology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cytologic specimens obtained from the vitreous or subret&#173;i&#173;nal space often show pleomorphic cells with scanty cytoplasm, hyperchromatic nuclei with multiple irregular nucleoli, and an elevated nuclear-&#173;to-&#173;cytoplasm ratio (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 13-4</span>). Monoclonality of cells is likely to be pres&#173;ent in PCNSL. This can be established through immunophenotyping by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry to demonstrate the clonality of B lymphocytes by the presence of abnormal immunoglobulin <span class="greek">κ</span> or <span class="greek">γ</span> light chain predominance, specific B-&#173;lymphocyte markers (CD19, CD20, and CD22), and/or gene or oncogene translocations or gene rearrangements. Abnormal lymphocytes may be isolated manually or by &#173;laser capture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–&#173;based assays performed to improve the diagnostic yield of paucicellular samples. See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;4</span>, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors</span>, for discussion of intraocular lymphoma.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The current treatment of PVRL involves intravitreal chemotherapy (methotrexate and/or rituximab) and local external beam radiation of the eye, with or without systemic chemotherapy depending on CNS involvement. In cases with concomitant PCNSL, systemic high-&#173;dose chemotherapy in conjunction with intrathecal therapy, &#173;whole-brain radiotherapy, and/or autologous stem cell transplantation are considered. &#173;There are vari&#173;ous chemotherapy regimens. Among the most commonly used is high-&#173;dose systemic methotrexate with rituximab. Some specialists use prophylactic treatment of the CNS even in cases of seemingly isolated ocular disease.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Prognosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Primary vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal lymphoma responds well to initial treatment; however, high rates of relapse and CNS involvement usually lead to poor prognosis and limited survival. The prognosis for survival depends on &#173;whether &#173;there is CNS involvement. Despite the availability of multiple treatment modalities and regimens, the long-&#173;term prognosis for patients with PCNSL remains poor; the median survival with supportive care alone is 2–3 months, and with surgery alone, median survival is in the range of 1–5 months. The longest median survival in vari&#173;ous reports approaches 40 months with treatment, and the 5-&#173;year overall survival is approximately 60%. &#173;Factors that negatively influence outcome include advanced age, worse neurologic functional classification level, multiple rather than single lesions pres&#173;ent in the CNS, and deep nuclei/periventricular lesions rather than superficial ce&#173;re&#173;bral and cerebellar hemispheric lesions.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Neoplastic Masquerade Syndromes Secondary to Systemic Lymphoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Though rare, systemic lymphomas can spread hematogenously to the choroid, subret&#173;i&#173;nal space, vitreous, and anterior chamber. &#173;These entities can pres&#173;ent with a pseudohypopyon, vitritis, creamy subret&#173;i&#173;nal infiltrates, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, necrotizing retinitis, and diffuse choroiditis or uveal masses.</p>
			<p class="h2">Neoplastic Masquerade Syndromes Secondary to Leukemia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with leukemia may have ret&#173;i&#173;nal findings, including intraret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages, cotton-&#173;wool spots, white-&#173;centered hemorrhages, microaneurysms, and peripheral neovascularization. In rare instances, leukemic cells may invade the vitreous cavity. If the choroid is involved, exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment may be pres&#173;ent and is angiographically similar to Vogt-&#173;Koyanagi-&#173;Harada (VKH) syndrome. Leukemia may also pres&#173;ent with a hypopyon or hyphema, iris heterochromia, or a pseudohypopyon, which can be gray-&#173;yellow.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Neoplastic Masquerade Syndromes Secondary to Uveal Lymphoid Proliferations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The uveal tract may be a site for benign reactive uveal lymphoid hyperplasia that can mimic chronic uveitis. Presenting symptoms may include vision loss that is gradual, painless, and unilateral or bilateral. Early-stage disease shows multifocal creamy choroidal lesions that may mimic sarcoid uveitis or birdshot uveitis. Macular edema may be pres&#173;ent. Anterior uveitis with acute symptoms of pain, redness, and photophobia may also be pres&#173;ent. Glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) are common. &#173;Angle structures may be infiltrated by lymphocytes, resulting in elevation of IOP. &#173;There may be overlap in pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion with posterior scleritis and uveal effusion syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fleshy episcleral or conjunctival masses that may appear salmon-&#173;pink may be pres&#173;ent. Unlike subconjunctival lymphomas, &#173;these masses are not mobile and are attached firmly to the sclera. Biopsy specimens demonstrate mature lymphocytes and plasma cells, quite dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from the appearance of specimens with PCNSL.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Therapy using corticosteroids, radiation, or both has been used with variable results. Systemic and periocular corticosteroid therapy can lead to rapid regression of the lesions, as can external-&#173;beam radiation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Nonlymphoid Malignancies</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Uveal melanoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 5% of patients with uveal melanoma pres&#173;ent with signs of ocular inflammation, including episcleritis, anterior or posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. Most tumors that pres&#173;ent in this fashion are epithelioid-&#173;cell or mixed-&#173;cell choroidal melanomas. Ultrasonography is useful in diagnosing aty&#173;pi&#173;cal cases &#173;because of the characteristically low internal reflectivity of &#173;these lesions. Management of uveal melanomas is discussed in BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors.</span></p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Retinoblastoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 1%–3% of retinoblastomas may pres&#173;ent with the appearance of inflammation, caused primarily by the relatively rare variant of diffuse infiltrating retinoblastoma. Patients are usually between age 4 and 6&#160;years at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion. &#173;These cases can be diagnostically confusing &#173;because of the limited visibility of the fundus and the lack of calcification on radiography or ultrasonography. Patients may have conjunctival chemosis, pseudo&#173;hypopyon, and vitritis. The pseudohypopyon typically shifts with changes in head position and is usually white as opposed to the yellowish color of inflammatory hypopyon.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Juvenile xanthogranuloma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Juvenile xanthogranuloma is the result of a histiocytic pro&#173;cess affecting mainly the skin and eyes, and, in rare instances, viscera. Patients usually pres&#173;ent before the age of 1 year with characteristic reddish-&#173;yellow skin lesions. Histologic investigation shows large &#173;histiocytes with foamy cytoplasm and Touton &#173;giant cells. Ocular lesions can involve the iris and result in a spontaneous hyphema. Iris biopsy samples show fewer foamy histiocytes and fewer Touton &#173;giant cells than do skin biopsy specimens. Other ocular structures may rarely be involved. If the skin of the eyelids is involved, the globe is usually spared. Intraocular lesions may respond to topical, periocular, or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Resistant cases may require local resection, radiation, or immunomodulatory therapy.</p>

Juvenile xanthogranuloma masquerading as pediatric chronic uveitis: a clinicopathologic study. <span class="reference--journal-_italic">Surv Ophthalmol.</span> 2001;46(2):164–171.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Metastatic Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most intraocular malignancies in adults are metastatic tumors. The most common primary cancers include lung and breast. Choroidal metastasis may be marked by vitritis, serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, and, occasionally, macular edema. &#173;These lesions are often bilateral and multifocal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anterior uveal metastasis may pres&#173;ent with cells in the aqueous humor, iris nodules, neovascularization of the iris, and elevated IOP. Anterior chamber paracentesis may help confirm the diagnosis. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal metastases are extremely rare. Primary cancers metastatic to the ret&#173;ina include cutaneous melanoma (the most common), followed by lung, gastrointestinal, and breast cancer. Metastatic melanoma often produces brown spherules in the ret&#173;ina, whereas other metastatic cancers appear white to yellow and may result in peri&#173;vascular sheathing, simulating a ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis or necrotizing retinitis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Bilateral Diffuse Uveal Melanocytic Proliferation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic tumors have been associated with systemic malignancy. Such tumors can be accompanied by rapid vision loss, cataracts, multiple pigmented and nonpigmented placoid iris and choroidal nodules, and serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments. This condition can mimic VKH syndrome. Histologic investigation shows diffuse infiltration of the uveal tract by benign nevoid or spindle-&#173;shaped cells. Necrosis within the tumors may be pres&#173;ent, and scleral involvement is common. The cause of this entity is unknown. Treatment should be directed at finding and treating the under&#173;lying primary lesion.</p>

			<div id="Chapt13_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Retinitis Pigmentosa</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) often have variable numbers of vitreous and anterior chamber cells and can develop macular edema. Features of RP that differentiate it from uveitis include nyctalopia, positive &#173;family history, and, on fundus examination, waxy disc pallor, attenuation of arterioles, and a bone-&#173;spicule pattern of pigmentary changes in the mid&#173;periphery. Electroretinographic responses of patients with RP often appear severely depressed or extinguished, even early in the disease. However, &#173;these findings can be found in late posterior uveitis, making differentiation between the entities very difficult in some cases. Late-stage birdshot chorioretinopathy can mimic RP (see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous,</span> for additional information).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Ocular Ischemic Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular ischemic syndrome results from hypoperfusion of the entire eye and sometimes the orbit, usually &#173;because of carotid artery obstruction. Patients with ocular ischemic syndrome are typically men aged 65&#160;years or older. Patients pres&#173;ent with decreased vision and mild ocular pain. Examination findings may include corneal edema, anterior chamber cells, and moderate flare, the last often greater than and out of proportion to the number of cells. Anterior segment neovascularization may be pres&#173;ent. Intraocular pressure may be low from decreased aqueous production due to ischemia or high due to neovascular glaucoma. A cataract may be more prominent on the involved side. The vitreous is usually clear. Dilated fundus examination may show mild disc edema associated with dilated tortuous ret&#173;i&#173;nal venules, narrowed arterioles, and medium to large intraret&#173;i&#173;nal scattered blot hemorrhages in the midperiphery and far periphery of the ret&#173;ina. Neovascularization may be pres&#173;ent on the disc or elsewhere in the ret&#173;ina.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fluorescein angiography shows delayed arteriolar filling, diffuse leakage in the posterior pole as well as from the optic disc, and signs of capillary nonperfusion. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular staining may be pres&#173;ent in the absence of any physical vascular sheathing on examination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnostic studies include carotid Doppler ultrasonography; ipsilateral carotid stenosis greater than 90% supports the diagnosis of ocular ischemic syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Definitive treatment involves carotid endarterectomy. Local treatment consists of topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics, as well as panret&#173;i&#173;nal photocoagulation, especially if rubeosis or ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization is pres&#173;ent. Intraocular injection of vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF) inhibitors may also be considered. The 5-&#173;year mortality rate of patients with ocular ischemic syndrome is 40%, primarily from cardiovascular disease and myo&#173;car&#173;dial infarction. The visual prognosis is guarded, and many patients improve transiently with treatment but eventually worsen.</p>

			<p class="h2">Chronic Peripheral Rhegmatogenous Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Detachment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chronic peripheral rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment can be associated with anterior segment cell and flare and vitreous inflammatory and pigment cells. Patients often have good vision that can sometimes deteriorate &#173;because of macular edema. Careful dilated fundus examination with scleral depression is of paramount importance in establishing the diagnosis. Findings may include peripheral pigment demarcation lines, subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid, ret&#173;i&#173;nal breaks, subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis, and peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal cysts. Photoreceptor outer segments liberated from the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space may be pres&#173;ent in the anterior chamber, simulating inflammatory cells. In such situations, IOP may be elevated, as &#173;these photoreceptor outer segments are phagocytosed by the endothelial cells in the trabecular meshwork, resulting in secondary open-&#173;angle glaucoma. This condition is called <span class="italic">Schwartz syndrome.</span></p>

			<p class="h2">Intraocular Foreign Bodies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retained intraocular foreign bodies may produce chronic intraocular inflammation as the result of mechanical, chemical, toxic, or inflammatory irritation of uveal tissues (particularly the ciliary body). A high index of suspicion and the following are essential: a careful history; clinical examination; and ancillary testing, including gonioscopy, ultrasonography, and CT of the eye and orbits. If this condition is suspected and recognized quickly, identification and removal of the foreign body are often curative. If the diagnosis is delayed, ocular complications, such as proliferative vitreoretinopathy and endophthalmitis, result in a poorer visual prognosis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Pigment Dispersion Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pigment dispersion syndrome is characterized by pigment granules that have been released from the iris, ciliary body, or both and are floating in the anterior chamber; &#173;these granules may be confused with the cells of anterior uveitis. Refer to BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> for a complete discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2">Other Syndromes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Certain infectious uveitic entities may also be mistaken for immunologic uveitis. Thus, nonneoplastic masquerade syndromes can also include bacterial uveitis caused by infection with <span class="italic">Nocardia</span> species or <span class="italic">Tropheryma whipplei</span> (Whipple disease), as well as fungal endophthalmitis due to infection with <span class="italic">Candida</span> species, <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> species, or <span class="italic">Coccidioides immitis.</span> &#173;These entities are discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapters&#160;10</span> and <span class="xref-local">11</span>.</p>
