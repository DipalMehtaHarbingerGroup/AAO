			<div id="Chapt14_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with chronic uveitis, especially &#173;children, may develop calcium deposition along the epithelial basement membrane and the Bowman layer, a condition termed <span class="italic">band keratopathy.</span> This complication is most often seen in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)–&#173;associated anterior uveitis and undifferentiated chronic anterior uveitis. It may arise within months of onset of the uveitis. &#173;These calcium deposits are usually located in the interpalpebral zone. Calcific band keratopathy may become visually significant when it extends into the visual axis, or it may cause symptoms of foreign-body sensation; in such cases, removal may be required. The calcium deposits are located beneath the corneal epithelium; thus, their removal requires epithelial debridement followed by chelation with disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Recurrences may require repeat EDTA treatments. Photorefractive keratotomy can also be considered.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Cataracts</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Any eye with chronic or recurrent uveitis may develop cataract as a result of the inflammation or the corticosteroids used for treatment. Indications for cataract surgery in uveitic eyes are the same as for all cataracts: when the cataract &#173;causes functional impairment that interferes with activities of daily living, when the cataract is responsible for at least a portion of that decrease in vision, and when functional improvement is likely to occur &#173;after cataract extraction (a particularly impor&#173;tant consideration in &#173;children who may develop amblyopia). Additional considerations for cataract surgery in uveitic eyes are &#173;whether a cataract precludes the clinician from obtaining an adequate view of the fundus—&#173;thereby inhibiting appropriate monitoring of posterior segment disease or health—&#173;and the degree to which the uveitis has been controlled.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As mentioned earlier, careful preoperative evaluation is necessary to ascertain &#173;whether the cataract is actually contributing to visual dysfunction. Vision loss in uveitis may stem from a variety of other ocular complications of uveitis, including corneal or vitreous opacity, macular edema, macular atrophy or fibrosis, and glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Studies have shown that phacoemulsification with posterior chamber (in-&#173;the-&#173;bag) intraocular lens (IOL) implantation effectively improves vision and is well tolerated in many eyes with uveitis, even over long periods.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Uveitic eyes are at greater risk for postoperative complications than nonuveitic eyes. Thus, careful planning, including preoperative medical management and the timing of the procedure, is critical. The key to a successful visual outcome is meticulous long-&#173;term control of inflammation prior to surgery. Common advice is to achieve the best control pos&#173;si&#173;ble without flare-&#173;ups for at least 3 months prior to cataract surgery. The rationale is to ensure the eye is stable on the current medical regimen and the tissues are allowed to recover from prior inflammation before the eye is challenged with a surgical procedure that can lead to a profound postoperative inflammatory response.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The recommendation for maintenance of maximum control for at least 3 months before surgery is based on retrospective clinical case series and clinical experience; no prospective or controlled &#173;trials provide definitive data. As such, exceptions may be made when the considered opinion of the treating physician is that a delay in surgery is not indicated. Examples include eyes with mild uveitis lacking sequelae, disorders that have a&#160;good surgical prognosis (eg, Fuchs heterochromic uveitis), or special circumstances such as lens-&#173;induced uveitis or the need to view the posterior segment (eg, to repair a rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment). It should be noted that the “best control pos&#173;si&#173;ble” is not achieved by incomplete control with corticosteroids alone. The clinician must utilize all appropriate means for control, including immunosuppression if needed. If the clinician is uncomfortable with such means of treatment, then referral to a specialist with that experience is required before proceeding with cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once appropriate control is achieved, preoperative pulsing with oral corticosteroids (0.5–1.0&#160;mg/kg/day, usually for 3 days, although opinions vary as to dose and duration) and/or intensive topical corticosteroid treatment should be considered. Prospective comparative data regarding optimal perioperative inflammatory control are lacking, and accepted regimens largely rely on the surgeon’s preference and experience. Dosages may be tapered over weeks to months &#173;after surgery, based on the severity of the under&#173;lying uveitis before surgery and the postoperative inflammatory response. Postoperative use of nonsteroidal anti-&#173;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has not been studied in eyes with uveitis but is frequently employed in nonuveitic eyes that are undergoing cataract surgery, with the goal of preventing uveitic macular edema (UME). Corneal toxicity from topical NSAIDs used concurrently with topical corticosteroids is a concern. Patients with certain infectious uveitides (eg, uveitis caused by <span class="italic">Toxoplasma gondii</span> infection and herpetic uveitis) may require perioperative prophylactic antimicrobial therapy to prevent surgically induced recurrence—&#173;preoperative oral corticosteroids are usually not given.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cataract surgery in uveitic eyes is generally more complex than in nonuveitic eyes &#173;because of the potential presence of sequelae of uveitis, including posterior synechiae, pupillary membranes, corneal edema or opacity, and hypotony. Entrance into the eye through a clear corneal approach is often used and may be particularly desirable in cases of scleritis that may be prone to postoperative scleral necrosis. Posterior synechiae and pupillary miosis may require mechanical or viscoelastic pupil stretching, sphincterotomies, or the use of flexible iris retractors (Video 14-1).</p>

			<p class="body-text">Although a curvilinear capsulorrhexis is preferred, a fibrotic anterior capsule may be more difficult to open with a capsulorrhexis than with a can-opener capsulotomy. Zonular insufficiency may be pres&#173;ent, which may make phacoemulsification and lens implantation challenging or impossible. In such cases, &#173;there may be few alternatives, and the surgeon’s preference may be to perform pars plana lensectomy and vitrectomy and avoid placing an IOL &#173;because of the lack of capsular support or zonular dehiscence. Fortunately, this scenario is rare. Meticulous cortical cleanup is impor&#173;tant to avoid leaving &#173;behind potentially proinflammatory material in the eye. For IOL choice, many surgeons prefer hydrophobic acrylic posterior chamber IOLs placed in the capsular bag. The possibility of &#173;future vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal surgery with silicone oil should be considered when deciding &#173;whether to use silicone IOLs. At the conclusion of the surgery, periocular or intravitreal corticosteroids may be administered. Postoperatively, immunomodulation is continued and supplemented with liberal use of topical corticosteroids, which are slowly tapered.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Phacoemulsification with IOL implantation can also be done in conjunction with pars plana vitrectomy if clinical or ultrasonographic findings suggest the presence of substantial vision-&#173;limiting vitreous debris or macular pathology such as epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membranes. When &#173;there has been significant structural damage from inflammation, or in cases in which the surgical prognosis is more guarded (eg, in JIA-&#173;associated uveitis), vitrectomy and aphakia may be the best course. Relative contraindications for IOL implantation include the prior development of rubeosis, a history of extensive membrane formation, and hypotony, although even in &#173;these circumstances, an IOL may be used in select cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There is controversy regarding IOL placement in &#173;children with JIA-&#173;associated uveitic cataracts. Avoiding aphakia in &#173;children is desirable but may not always be in the best interest of the patient. Choosing the proper IOL power, especially in &#173;children &#173;under the age of 10&#160;years, is difficult &#173;because of normal ocular/orbital growth. (For more information about IOL use in &#173;children, see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>.) Regardless, the most impor&#173;tant step in the treatment of &#173;these &#173;children is stringent control of preoperative and postoperative intraocular inflammation using corticosteroids and immunomodulatory therapy (IMT). If IOLs are used, in-&#173;the-&#173;bag implantation of acrylic IOLs and primary posterior capsulorrhexis are preferred in &#173;children. Silicone IOLs are not typically used in uveitic cataracts. &#173;These IOLs may lead to suboptimal outcomes and complicate &#173;future vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal surgery. Some surgeons may also perform a core anterior vitrectomy through the posterior capsulorrhexis prior to IOL placement. Administration of intraocular corticosteroids at the end of the procedure is extremely useful for controlling postoperative inflammation and UME. If &#173;these methods are used, 75% of patients &#173;will obtain a visual acuity of better than 20/40.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Close monitoring with immediate attention to any postoperative increase in inflammation or complications is imperative. Visual compromise following phacoemulsification with posterior chamber lens implantation in patients with uveitis is usually attributed to posterior segment abnormalities, most commonly UME. Postoperative UME rates may be reduced through the use of perioperative corticosteroids and with delay of surgery &#173;until the uveitis has been controlled for at least 3 months. The postoperative course may also be complicated by the recurrence or exacerbation of uveitis. The incidence of posterior capsule opacification is higher in uveitic than nonuveitic eyes, leading to earlier use of Nd:YAG &#173;laser capsulotomy. Furthermore, Nd:YAG capsulotomy may exacerbate uveitis, suggesting that some uveitis patients undergoing capsulotomy may benefit from more careful monitoring &#173;after the procedure. In some uveitic conditions, such as pars planitis, inflammatory debris may accumulate, and membranes may form on the surface of the IOL. Strict control of inflammation remains paramount for reducing the chance of &#173;these deposits. Long-&#173;term administration of topical corticosteroids may be necessary. Despite aggressive use of IMT, inflammatory cocooning of the IOL–&#173;lens capsule complex and uncontrolled inflammation may necessitate IOL explantation in 5%–10% of patients. Frequent follow-up, a high index of suspicion, and aggressive IMT can optimize short-&#173; and long-&#173;term visual results.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-8">Glaucoma</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in uveitic eyes may be acute, chronic, or recurrent. In eyes with long-&#173;term ciliary body inflammation, the IOP may fluctuate between abnormally high and low values. Numerous morphologic, cellular, and biochemical alterations occur in the uveitic eye that cause uveitic glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Successful management of uveitic glaucoma and ocular hypertension requires the identification and treatment of each of &#173;these contributing &#173;factors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Assessment of patients with uveitis and elevated IOP should include the same mea&#173;sures taken as for any case of ocular hypertension: slit-&#173;lamp and dilated fundus examination, gonioscopy, evaluation of the optic nerve head with disc photo&#173;graphs and optical coherence tomography (OCT), and serial automated visual fields.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Uveitic Ocular Hypertension</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Unilateral uveitis of sudden onset with open &#173;angles and increased IOP may be of infectious origin, particularly from viral &#173;causes but also from <span class="italic">Toxoplasma</span>. Thus, in the presence of active inflammation early in the course of uveitis, clinicians should resist the urge to prematurely taper corticosteroids &#173;because of a fear of corticosteroid-&#173;induced ocular hypertension. Corticosteroid-&#173;induced ocular hypertension rarely occurs before 3 weeks &#173;after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Early IOP elevations with active inflammation are almost always caused by inflammation that requires aggressive anti-&#173;inflammatory treatment.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Uveitic Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Uveitic glaucoma often results from a combination of mechanisms. Glaucoma associated with uveitis is best classified by morphologic changes in &#173;angle structure; thus, uveitic <br />glaucoma may be divided into secondary angle-&#173;closure and secondary open-&#173;angle glaucoma. &#173;These entities may be further subdivided into acute and chronic types. In addition, corticosteroid-&#173;induced ocular hypertension and glaucoma are other components that must be addressed in cases of chronic uveitic glaucoma. See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Sec</span><span class="xref-local">tion&#160;10</span>, <span class="italic">Glaucoma.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Secondary angle-&#173;closure glaucoma</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h4-head">Acute with central shallowing of the anterior chamber</span> Acute secondary angle-&#173;closure glaucoma may occur when choroidal inflammation results in forward rotation of the ciliary body and lens–&#173;iris diaphragm. It can be the presenting sign of Vogt-&#173;Koyanagi-&#173;Harada (VKH) syndrome or sympathetic ophthalmia. Patients pres&#173;ent with pain, elevated IOP, and no posterior synechiae. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) or ultrasound evaluation showing choroidal thickening and anterior rotation of the ciliary body is diagnostic. Treatment is with aggressive corticosteroid therapy, aqueous suppressants, and cycloplegia to induce a posterior rotation of the ciliary body. As the inflammation subsides, the chamber deepens and the IOP normalizes. Peripheral iridotomy or iridectomy is not useful in &#173;these acute cases &#173;because the under&#173;lying cause is not pupillary block.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-3"><span class="h4-head">Acute without central shallowing of the anterior chamber</span>  Chronic or acute recurrent anterior segment inflammation may result in the formation of circumferential posterior synechiae with pupillary block due to seclusion of the pupil and resultant iris bomb<span class="h4-text_accent">é</span>, producing secondary peripheral &#173;angle closure. Whereas synechiae formation usually occurs over time, the development of iris bomb<span class="h4-text_accent">é</span> may be an acute event. Peripheral &#173;laser iridotomy or surgical iridectomy results in resolution of the bomb<span class="h4-text_accent">é</span> and &#173;angle closure if performed before permanent peripheral anterior synechiae form. Iridotomies should be multiple, created as large as pos&#173;si&#173;ble. Exacerbation of inflammation can be anticipated &#173;after &#173;laser iridotomy in &#173;these eyes, making the iridotomies prone to close and requiring re-&#173;treatment or surgical iridectomy. Intensive topical corticosteroid and cycloplegic therapy is given following the procedure. In patients with brown irides, pretreatment of the iris with an argon &#173;laser before using the Nd:YAG &#173;laser may lessen the chance of bleeding and facilitate a wider opening. If &#173;laser iridotomy is not successful, surgical iridectomy is required. The procedure may be supplemented with goniosynechialysis if peripheral anterior synechiae have started to develop, but this approach is controversial.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-3"><span class="h4-head">Chronic</span> In addition to posterior synechiae, chronic intraocular inflammation may result in peripheral anterior synechiae and chronic secondary angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. Eyes with &#173;these complications often have chronic secondary open-&#173;angle glaucoma and corticosteroid-&#173;induced glaucoma superimposed. Topical aqueous suppressants may be inadequate to prevent progression of optic nerve head damage. &#173;These eyes may require goniosynechialysis and trabeculectomy with mitomycin C or placement of a glaucoma drainage device. See BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="h4-text_italic">Glaucoma,</span> for a more detailed discussion on surgical treatment options of glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Secondary open-&#173;angle glaucoma</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-9"><span class="h4-head">Acute</span> Inflammatory open-&#173;angle glaucoma occurs when the trabecular meshwork is inflamed (trabeculitis), as commonly occurs with infectious &#173;causes of uveitis such as toxo&#173;plasmic retinochoroiditis, necrotizing herpetic retinitis, herpes simplex and varicella-&#173;zoster anterior uveitis, cytomegalovirus anterior uveitis (including the Posner-&#173;Schlossman type), and sarcoid uveitis or when inflammatory debris clogs the &#173;angle. This type of glaucoma usually responds to specific treatment of the infectious agent supplemented by topical cycloplegics and corticosteroids.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Chronic</span> Chronic outflow obstruction is caused by direct damage to the trabecular meshwork. The management of chronic secondary open-&#173;angle glaucoma is similar to that of primary open-&#173;angle glaucoma (see BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="h4-text_italic">Glaucoma</span>), with the added complexity of maintaining strict control of intraocular inflammation through the use of IMT.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Combined-&#173;mechanism uveitic glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Multiple mechanisms may be responsible for elevated pressure in uveitic eyes. Treatment should be aimed at controlling the inflammation and IOP through a multimodal approach, including both medical and surgical therapy aimed at the responsible mechanisms.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Corticosteroid-&#173;Induced Ocular Hypertension and Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Elevated IOP in the setting of uveitis should prompt consideration of &#173;whether the cause is one of the aforementioned &#173;angle issues or is corticosteroid induced. Corticosteroids in any formulation—&#173;topical, periocular, intraocular (injection and sustained release), or oral—&#173;may induce an elevation of IOP that may be difficult to distinguish from other &#173;causes of ocular hypertension in uveitis. Use of the fluocinolone intraocular implant is associated with an eventual need for glaucoma surgery in approximately 40% of eyes. Difluprednate used topically also appears to be associated with significant and sometimes rapid increases in IOP. This IOP rise may be avoided by use of a less-&#173;potent topical corticosteroid preparation, a less-&#173;frequent administration schedule, or both. Fluorometholone, loteprednol, and rimexolone may be less likely to induce an IOP elevation but are also less effective in controlling intraocular inflammation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Medical management of uveitic glaucoma requires aggressive control of both intraocular inflammation and IOP as well as prevention of glaucomatous optic nerve damage and visual field loss (see BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma</span>). Aqueous suppressants are generally the first-&#173;line agents. Prostaglandin analogues may be used to treat uveitic glaucoma and generally do not exacerbate intraocular inflammation, especially when used concomitantly with IMT and corticosteroids. However, caution should be used in eyes with herpetic uveitis. Use of pilocarpine should be avoided in uveitis, as the smaller fixed pupil may be at risk for worsening of posterior synechiae, and pilocarpine &#173;causes breakdown of the blood–&#173;aqueous barrier.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When medical management fails, glaucoma filtering surgery is indicated. Standard trabeculectomy has a greater risk of failure in &#173;these eyes. Results may be improved by using mitomycin C with intensive topical corticosteroids. However, intense and recurrent postoperative inflammation can often lead to failure of filtering surgery in uveitic eyes. Up to 90% of patients 1 year &#173;after surgery and approximately 62% 5&#160;years &#173;after surgery achieve IOP control with 1 or 0 medi&#173;cations. Surgical complications include cataract formation, bleb leakage (early and late) that could lead to endophthalmitis, and choroidal effusions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Alternatives to classic trabeculectomy are numerous and have been used with some short-&#173;term success in uveitic glaucoma. Nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy with or without a drainage implant has been shown effective in controlling IOP in up to 90% of uveitic eyes for 1 year &#173;after surgery. Viscocanalostomy has shown higher success rates in a limited number of studies. Among pediatric uveitis patients, goniotomy has up to a 75% chance of reducing IOP to 21&#160;mm Hg or less &#173;after 2 surgeries. This procedure may be complicated by transient hyphema and worsening of the preexisting cataract. Trabeculodialysis and &#173;laser sclerostomy have high rates of failure &#173;because of recurrent postoperative inflammation. The role of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery remains unclear in uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most cases of uveitic glaucoma, especially in pseudophakic or aphakic eyes, require aqueous drainage devices. &#173;These devices may be tunneled into the anterior chamber or placed through the pars plana directly into the vitreous cavity &#173;after vitrectomy. A unidirectional valve design (valve implant) can prevent postoperative hypotony. &#173;These implants are more likely than trabeculectomy to successfully control IOP in the long term; results indicate up to a 75% reduction of IOP from preoperative levels and that nearly 75% of patients achieve target IOP levels with use of 0 or 1 topical antiglaucoma medi&#173;cation &#173;after 4&#160;years. Complications of glaucoma-&#173;drainage-&#173;device surgery (10%/patient-&#173;year) include shallow anterior chamber, hypotony, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, and blockage of the drainage device by blood, fibrin, or iris. Long-&#173;term complications include device erosion through the conjunctiva, valve migration, corneal decompensation, drainage device–&#173;cornea touch, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Unlike trabeculectomy, &#173;these drainage devices have proven to be robust and continue to function despite chronic, recurrent inflammation; they provide excellent long-&#173;term IOP control in eyes with uveitic glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cyclodestructive procedures may worsen ocular inflammation and lead to hypotony and phthisis bulbi. &#173;Laser trabeculoplasty is generally considered in&#173;effec&#173;tive in eyes with uveitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As with all surgeries in uveitic eyes, tight and meticulous control of perioperative inflammation—&#173;including the use of preoperative regimens similar to &#173;those used before cataract surgery as well as of immunomodulators and corticosteroids—&#173;not only improves the success of glaucoma surgery but also improves visual acuity outcomes by limiting sight-&#173;threatening complications such as UME and hypotony.

			<div id="Chapt14_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute inflammation of the ciliary body may cause aqueous hyposecretion and low IOP. This reduction in IOP is reversible with control of intraocular inflammation. In contrast, chronic inflammation may lead to ciliary body damage and atrophy of the ciliary pro&#173;cesses, resulting in permanent hypotony. Hypotony may result in hypotony maculopathy, vision loss, and/or phthisis. Serous choroidal detachment often accompanies hypotony and complicates management. Prolonged choroidal effusions may require surgical drainage. Chronic hypotony can be treated with long-term local ste&#173;roid administration in some cases. Surgery is indicated if &#173;there is ciliary body traction from a cyclitic membrane that can be released and if the ciliary pro&#173;cesses are preserved (as shown on UBM). If ciliary pro&#173;cesses are atrophic, vitrectomy with intraocular silicone oil or viscoelastic may help maintain ocular anatomy and increase IOP. In some of &#173;these cases, vision improvement &#173;after surgery can be significant; &#173;these gains may, however, be transient.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-12">Uveitic Macular Edema</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Uveitic macular edema is a common cause of vision loss in eyes with uveitis. The edema is usually caused by active intraocular inflammation and appears to be mediated by the proinflammatory cytokines vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6, which cause ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular leakage and ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment endothelium dysfunction. Less commonly, UME may be caused by mechanical vitreomacular traction; the distinction can be differentiated by OCT. It can also be quantitatively evaluated and monitored by serial spectral-&#173;domain OCT and fluorescein angiography studies. The severity of UME does not necessarily correspond to the level of inflammatory disease activity; UME is often slow to respond and clear and frequently remains even &#173;after vis&#173;i&#173;ble, active inflammation has resolved. Smoking appears to be associated with a greater prevalence of UME, especially in patients with intermediate uveitis and panuveitis.</p>

			<p class="h2">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of UME must first be directed &#173;toward control of intraocular inflammation. If UME persists despite control of inflammation, therapy directed specifically &#173;toward the UME is required. This treatment may be regional or systemic. Periocular injections of corticosteroid may be used; a superotemporal posterior sub-&#173;Tenon injection of 20–40&#160;mg of triamcinolone acetonide is preferred. Theoretically, this technique delivers juxtascleral corticosteroid closest to the macula. The injections may be repeated monthly. If UME persists, then 2–4&#160;mg of intravitreal preservative-&#173;free triamcinolone may be considered. Intravitreal triamcinolone can be highly effective in reducing UME, particularly in nonvitrectomized eyes, but its effect is time limited; the drug is eliminated more quickly from the vitreous cavity of vitrectomized eyes. Visual improvement and reduction of UME &#173;after intravitreal triamcinolone injection typically occur within 4 weeks. Eyes with a longer duration of UME and worse vision on pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion tend to show the least amount of vision improvement &#173;after treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone. Corticosteroid-&#173;induced elevation of IOP may occur in up to 40% of patients, especially in &#173;those younger than 40&#160;years.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sustained delivery of corticosteroid to the vitreous cavity through the use of implants is also effective. Currently available implants in the United States include the fluocinolone acetonide implant and an intravitreal sustained-&#173;release drug-&#173;delivery system for dexamethasone (700 µg). The risk of ocular hypertension is lower for the dexamethasone delivery system than for the fluocinolone implant. The VEGF inhibitors can also reduce inflammatory UME, but the action is of short duration and repeat injections are required. Intravitreal methotrexate (400 µg/0.1&#160;mL) has been shown to be effective in reducing UME in a limited number of patients and is &#173;under active investigation. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span> for additional information on the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of uveitis including UME.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Topical NSAIDs can be beneficial in treating pseudophakic UME, but their effectiveness in the treatment of UME has not been established. Oral acetazolamide, 500&#160;mg once or twice daily, has also been effective in reducing UME, particularly in patients whose inflammation is well controlled. Systemic interferon therapy has shown efficacy in resolving recalcitrant UME, with complete control in 62.5% of patients in one study. Common adverse effects include flulike symptoms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgical therapy for UME is still controversial. Pars plana vitrectomy for UME in the presence of hyaloidal traction on the macula (as demonstrated on OCT imaging) may be visually and anatomically beneficial. In the absence of vitreomacular traction, however, the efficacy of pars plana vitrectomy in treating UME is not well understood. &#173;There is some suggestion that vitrectomy may be beneficial in managing recalcitrant UME, but this application requires further investigation.</p>

			<div id="Chapt14_Top9">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment (RRD) occurs in 3% of patients with uveitis. Panuveitis and infectious uveitis are the entities most frequently associated with RRD, although pars planitis and posterior uveitis can also be associated with rhegmatogenous or tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments. Uveitis is often still active in eyes that pres&#173;ent with RRD. Up to 30% of patients with uveitis and RRD may have proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion; this percentage is significantly higher than in primary RRD in patients without uveitis. Repair is often complicated by preexisting PVR, vitreous membranes, and poor visualization. Repair of ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment in uveitis is challenging and may require the full armamentarium of surgical strategies employed in complex ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment repair.

			<div id="Chapt14_Top10">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization is most often associated with posterior uveitis. Some diseases are more prone to be complicated by CNV (eg, as multifocal choroiditis, punctate inner choroiditis, or serpiginous choroiditis), whereas some are more likely to be complicated by retinal neovascularization (eg, retinal vasculitis of various causes, including Eales disease). Ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization results from chronic inflammation or capillary nonperfusion. Treatment is directed &#173;toward the under&#173;lying etiology. The presence of uveitic ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization does not always require panret&#173;i&#173;nal photocoagulation. Some cases of sarcoid panuveitis, for example, may pres&#173;ent with neovascularization of the disc that resolves completely with immunomodulatory and corticosteroid therapy alone. Thus, treatment must first be directed &#173;toward reduction of inflammation. If ischemia is angiographically extensive, as in ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis or Eales disease, scatter &#173;laser photocoagulation in the ischemic areas is therapeutic. Dramatic regression of neovascularization of the disc and elsewhere in vari&#173;ous inflammatory disorders typically occurs &#173;after 1 or 2 intravitreal injections of a VEGF inhibitor. This treatment may be used as an adjunct to IMT and scatter &#173;laser photocoagulation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) can develop in uveitis as a result of a disruption of the Bruch membrane from choroidal inflammation and the presence of inflammatory cytokines that promote angiogenesis. The prevalence of CNV varies among dif&#173;fer&#173;ent entities; for example, it can occur in up to 10% of patients with VKH syndrome. Patients pres&#173;ent with metamorphopsia and scotoma, and diagnosis is based on clinical and angiographic findings. Treatment should be directed &#173;toward reducing inflammation as well as anatomical ablation of the CNV. Treatment of subfoveal CNV is accomplished with VEGF inhibitors; results of one study showed that 2–3 intravitreal injections improved vision and reduced the size of subfoveal CNV in nearly all patients. Control of inflammation in &#173;these cases may reduce the risk of recurrence of CNV and the need for repeated intravitreal injections.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Despite optimal treatment, inflammatory disorders of the eye can lead to decreased vision. Worldwide, inflammatory disease is a significant cause of blindness and low vision. In the United States, 10% of all blindness is attributed to inadequately treated uveitis. Clinicians can assist their patients by inquiring if vision loss secondary to inflammation is affecting day-&#173;to-&#173;day functions, such as reading or enjoying leisure activities, and by advising patients about vision rehabilitation resources. Referral to vision rehabilitation is recommended for patients with visual acuity less than 20/40&#160;in the better eye, reduced contrast sensitivity, disabling glare, or central or peripheral visual field loss (see BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics</span>). The low vision section of the American Acad&#173;emy of Ophthalmology website (<a href="http://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/low-vision-list">www.&#173;aao.&#173;org/&#173;eye-&#173;health/&#173;diseases/&#173;low-&#173;vision-&#173;list</a>) defines low vision and discusses low vision symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, vision aids, and how patients can identify vision rehabilitation resources in their community.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is particularly impor&#173;tant for clinicians to provide parents of &#173;children with uveitis information about rehabilitation to optimize functioning at school and in other activities. A useful guide for teachers and parents can be found at <a href="http://www.uveitis.org/patients/education/patient-guides">www.&#173;uveitis.&#173;org/&#173;patients/&#173;education/&#173;patient-&#173;guides</a>.</p>
