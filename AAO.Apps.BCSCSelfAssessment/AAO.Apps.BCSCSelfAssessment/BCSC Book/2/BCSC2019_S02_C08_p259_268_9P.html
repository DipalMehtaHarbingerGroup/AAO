			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Corneal avascularity is required in order to maintain optical clarity; further, avascularity contributes to the immune privilege of the cornea. Vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor A (VEGF-&#173;A), which is pres&#173;ent in the cornea, is a potent angiogenic agent. Its actions are blocked by a soluble form of VEGF receptor 1 (also known as sflt-1). Suppression of this molecule has been shown to result in increased levels of unbound VEGF-&#173;A and in blood vessel growth in the cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because of the lack of blood vessels in the cornea, oxygen is provided to the cornea via the precorneal tear film, or <span class="italic">tear film</span> (which obtains oxygen from the air and eyelid vasculature), and aqueous humor. Glucose is the primary metabolic substrate for the epithelial cells, stromal keratocytes (corneal fibroblasts residing in the stroma), and endothelial cells. The stroma receives glucose primarily from the aqueous humor by carrier-&#173;mediated transport through the endothelium; the epithelium receives glucose by passive diffusion through the stroma and from the tear film. The precorneal tear film and limbal vessels supply approximately 10% of the glucose used by the cornea. Glucose is metabolized in the cornea by all 3 metabolic pathways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-3">hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">glycolysis</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-4">In the epithelium and endothelium, the HMP pathway breaks down 35%–65% of the glucose, but the keratocytes of the stroma metabolize very &#173;little glucose via this pathway. The keratocytes lack 6-&#173;phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, an impor&#173;tant enzyme in the HMP pathway. Pyruvic acid, the end product of glycolysis, is converted &#173;either to carbon dioxide and &#173;water (via the TCA cycle &#173;under aerobic conditions) or to lactic acid (&#173;under anaerobic conditions).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Production of lactic acid increases in conditions of oxygen deprivation, as in the case of tight-&#173;fitting contact lenses with low oxygen permeability. Accumulation of lactic acid in the cornea has detrimental consequences for vision, such as edema (due to an increase in an osmotic solute load) or stromal acidosis, which can change endothelial morphology and function.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Human corneas possess a remarkably high level of aldehyde dehydrogenase and trans&#173;ketolase. Together, &#173;these 2 proteins constitute 40%–50% of the soluble proteins in corneal stroma. Similar to enzyme crystallins of the lens, both aldehyde dehydrogenase and transke&#173;tolase are thought to contribute to the optical properties of the cornea. Both proteins are also thought to protect corneal cells against &#173;free radicals and oxidative damage by absorbing ultraviolet B radiation.</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-5">The biomechanical properties of the cornea affect its functional responses. An understanding of &#173;these properties can help clinicians to better anticipate or understand the cornea’s responses to stress and strain and also aid in diagnosing and treating corneal disease. The following clinically relevant princi&#173;ples have been confirmed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">The paracentral and peripheral cornea are stiffer than the central cornea &#173;because of differing orientation and number of collagen fibrils.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The elastic strength of the corneal stroma is greatest anteriorly and decreases posteriorly; thus, &#173;laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) flap creation and interruption of the anterior stromal lamellae are thought to disproportionately weaken the cornea and contribute to ectasia.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-7">The stiffness of the cornea increases with age, apparently as a result of natu&#173;ral collagen crosslinking.<p class="reference--non-journal--first _idGenParaOverride-1">Ambati BK, Nozaki M, Singh N, et&#160;al.

			<p class="h1">Epithelium</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The epithelium constitutes 5%–10% of the total corneal thickness. Surface projections (microvilli and microplicae) are pres&#173;ent on the apical surface of the most superficial cell layer of epithelium. &#173;These projections are coated with filamentous material known as <span class="italic">glycocalyx.</span> Mucin glycoproteins, the major constituents of glycocalyx, are thought to promote both stability of the tear film and wettability of the corneal surface (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Plasma membrane proteins and the lipids of corneal epithelial cells, similar to &#173;those of other cell types, are heavi&#173;ly glycosylated and play an impor&#173;tant role in cell–&#173;cell adhesion as well as in adhesion of the basal cells of the corneal epithelium to the under&#173;lying basement membrane. The sugar residues of the plasma membrane glycoproteins and the glycolipids of corneal epithelium also play a role in wound-&#173;healing mechanisms; they do so by mediating corneal epithelial sheet migration over the wound surface following ocular injury. &#173;These residues also contribute to the pathogenesis of corneal infection by serving as attachment sites for microbes. The normal rate of epithelial cell migration is 2&#160;mm per day and is adversely affected by preservatives in topical eyedrops.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Beginning with the discovery of the centripetal cell migration that occurs in the cornea, early studies on epithelial cell renewal led to the conclusion that the proliferative source of the corneal epithelium resides at the limbus. Interestingly, results of a more recent study suggest that corneal stem cells may also exist in the central cornea. The limbus is characterized by stromal invaginations known in &#173;humans as the <span class="italic">palisades of Vogt</span> (see Chapter&#160;2, Fig 2-8A). &#173;These papillae-&#173;like projections show a distinctive vasculature with radially oriented arterial and venous components. The palisades of Vogt have been suggested as the reservoir that</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">protects stem cells from traumatic and environmental insults</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">allows epithelial–&#173;mesenchymal interactions</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">provides access to chemical signals that diffuse from the rich under&#173;lying vascular network</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Normal corneal epithelium remains in a steady state in which cell proliferation is necessary to replace cells lost by terminal differentiation and desquamation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-2</span>). While basal cells of the central cornea proliferate actively, basal cells at the limbus consist of a mixture of slow-&#173;cycling stem cells and their progeny, transient amplifying (TA) cells, which are affected by growth &#173;factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix. During treatment of corneal wounds with cryopreserved amniotic membrane, TA cells are likely upregulated to enhance wound healing.</p>
			<p class="h2">Penetration of the Corneal Epithelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hydrophilic molecules penetrate the epithelium poorly, but they may pass through tight junctions if the polar molecule has a mass lower than 500&#160;Da. Hydrophilic drugs can also reach very high corneal penetration levels when the corneal epithelium is damaged or inflamed. The dissociation constant (also called <span class="italic">ionization constant</span>) is likewise impor&#173;tant in determining a molecule’s permeability across the cornea. To diffuse across the epithelium, organic molecules should be in an uncharged state. However, a charged molecule can more readily penetrate the stroma. To penetrate the cornea and enter the anterior chamber, therefore, an organic molecule should be able to dissociate at physiologic pH and temperature (ie, within the stroma).</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Bowman Layer</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Bowman layer is immediately beneath the epithelial basal lamina and is composed of randomly packed type I and type V collagen fibers that are 30&#160;nm in dia&#173;meter. The fibers are enmeshed in a matrix consisting of proteoglycans and glycoproteins. The Bowman layer is secreted during embryogenesis by the anterior stromal keratocytes and epithelium. It is acellular and does not regenerate when damaged.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is thought that this layer, by virtue of its acellularity and packing distribution, serves to prevent exposure of stromal keratocytes to growth &#173;factors secreted by epithelial cells, such as transforming growth &#173;factor <span class="greek">β</span>. This effect is notable &#173;because, in excimer &#173;laser surgery (photorefractive keratectomy [PRK] or &#173;laser subepithelial keratomileusis [LASEK]), the Bowman layer is removed, along with anterior corneal stromal tissue. Corneal haze, a potentially significant postoperative complication of &#173;these procedures, is presumably due to absence of the Bowman layer and consequent keratocyte exposure to growth &#173;factors. In LASIK, by contrast, the Bowman layer is transected but retained; central corneal haze is thus extremely rare &#173;after this procedure.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Stroma</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The stroma makes up approximately 90% of the total corneal thickness. Stromal cells, known as <span class="italic">keratocytes,</span> constitute 10%–40% of corneal volume, depending on age; loss of keratocyte density occurs with age. Usually, &#173;these cells reside between the collagen lamellae. The stroma is made up of roughly 200 lamellae, which are 1.5–2.5 <span class="greek">μ</span>m thick and composed of collagen fibrils enmeshed in a matrix consisting of proteoglycans, proteins, and glycoproteins. The stromal fibrils within each lamella are narrow and uniform in dia&#173;meter; in &#173;humans, the average fibril dia&#173;meter is 30&#160;nm. The stroma is less compact posteriorly, facilitating a deeper placement of intrastromal ring segments for keratoconus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Collagen fibrils within each lamella run parallel to one another from limbus to limbus. The orientation of the lamellae with each other depends on the location within the stroma. The lamellae are obliquely oriented in the anterior third and perpendicular in the posterior two-&#173;thirds of the stroma (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-3</span>). Also, collagen fibrils in each lamella are regularly spaced, with a center-&#173;to-&#173;center distance of 55–60&#160;nm. The narrow and uniform dia&#173;meter of collagen fibrils and their regular arrangement are characteristic of collagen of the corneal stroma and are necessary for the transparency of this tissue (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Type I is the major collagen component of the corneal stroma; it constitutes approximately 70% of the total stromal dry weight. Immunohistochemical and biochemical studies have demonstrated that normal adult corneal stroma also contains collagen types V, VI, VII, XII, and XIV. Type III collagen production is associated uniquely with stromal wound healing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;After collagen, proteoglycans are the second most abundant biological constituents of the cornea; they constitute approximately 10% of the dry weight of the cornea. Proteoglycans are the constituents that confer hydrophilic properties to the stroma. They are glycosylated proteins with at least 1 glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain covalently bound to the protein core. GAGs are composed of repeating disaccharides. The GAGs found in corneal stroma include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">keratan sulfate</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">chondroitin sulfate</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">dermatan sulfate</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Regulation of spacing between the stromal collagen fibrils is thought to result from highly specific interactions between the proteoglycans and the collagen fibrils. When &#173;these interactions are disturbed, the ability of the cornea to remain transparent is profoundly affected.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a &#173;family of Zn<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2+</span>-&#173;dependent enzymes responsible for degradation of the components of the extracellular matrix (including proteoglycans and vari&#173;ous types of collagens) during normal development as well as in disease pro&#173;cesses. Of the more than a dozen known metalloproteinases, only MMP-2 proenzyme has been found in the normal healthy cornea. However, &#173;after corneal injury, additional MMPs (including MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9) are synthesized. The proteinase inhibitors of the cornea play a key role in corneal protection by restricting damage during corneal inflammation, ulceration, and wound healing. Many of &#173;these inhibitors are synthesized by resident cells of the cornea; some are derived from tears, aqueous humor, and limbal blood vessels.</p>

			<p class="h1">Descemet Membrane and Endothelium</p>
			<div id="Chapt8_Top6">
			<p class="h2-h1">Descemet Membrane</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Descemet membrane is a specialized basement membrane, 10–12 <span class="greek">μ</span>m thick, between the corneal endothelium and the posterior stroma. It is secreted by endothelium and comprises an anterior banded layer and a posterior nonbanded layer. The latter is secreted throughout life, which is the reason why the Descemet membrane is 3–4 times thicker in adulthood than at birth (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-5</span>). Type IV is the most abundant collagen in the Descemet membrane. It has been hypothesized that the posterior-&#173;most 15 <span class="greek">μ</span>m of stroma may represent a distinct, tough acellular layer (Dua layer).</p>
			<p class="h2">Endothelium</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The corneal endothelium, located posterior to the Descemet membrane, is a monolayer of hexagonal cells with a dia&#173;meter of 20 <span class="greek">μ</span>m. In young adult eyes, the normal endothelial cell count is approximately 3000/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> centrally. The number of endothelial cells is higher in the periphery and decreases with age, with concomitant spreading and thinning of the remaining cells. The rate of physiologic corneal endothelial cell loss with normal aging has been reported to be 0.6% per year (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 8-6</span>, <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;8-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adjacent endothelial cells interdigitate in a complex way and form a variety of tight junctions, serving as a barrier to aqueous humor penetration, but desmosomes are never observed between normal cells. Approximately 20–30 short microvilli per cell extend from the apical plasma membrane into the aqueous humor. The endothelium functions both as a permeability barrier between the aqueous humor and the corneal stroma and as a pump to maintain the cornea in a dehydrated state by generating negative hydrostatic pressure, which also serves to hold &#173;free corneal flaps (eg, LASIK flaps) in place. The endothelium utilizes temperature-&#173;dependent Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase to maintain the hydration of the stroma at 78% and sustain corneal clarity. In vivo, the endothelium derives sufficient oxygen from the aqueous humor to maintain normal pump function.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the endothelium is injured, healing occurs mainly via migration, rearrangement, and enlargement of the residual cells. Substantial cell loss or damage results in irre&#173;versible edema &#173;because &#173;human corneal endothelial cells have limited ability to divide &#173;after birth. Infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to severe corneal injury can induce endothelial cells to become fibroblastic and to synthesize a <span class="italic">retrocorneal fi</span><span class="italic">brous </span><span class="italic">membrane (RCFM).</span> RCFM forms between the Descemet membrane and the corneal endo&#173;&#173;thelium and &#173;causes a significant decrease in visual acuity. Unlike normal corneal endothelial cells, which accumulate a limited amount of type I collagen protein, the fibroblastic cells isolated from the RCFM predominantly express type I collagen.</p>
