			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">At pre&#173;sent, a positive &#173;family history carries greater specificity and sensitivity than most laboratory ge&#173;ne&#173;tic tests. Even with all the DNA mutations currently known for diseases, the vast majority of mutations remains to be identified, and the full hand of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic cards dealt to each person is not known. Ge&#173;ne&#173;tics is impor&#173;tant in &#173;every ophthalmic consultation, from &#173;those involving rare inborn errors of metabolism or congenital malformations to common eye diseases, such as myopia, glaucoma, cataract, and age-&#173;related macular degeneration (AMD). Even susceptibility to infection and trauma can be ge&#173;ne&#173;tic. An understanding of the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic basis of a disease may be particularly useful for arriving at a correct diagnosis when another &#173;family member has a similar disease. In addition, it is impor&#173;tant for clinicians to recognize that a patient presenting with a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar eye prob&#173;lem may be at increased risk for an unrelated disease, such as glaucoma, &#173;because of an affected parent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist has an impor&#173;tant obligation to patients with ge&#173;ne&#173;tic eye diseases—&#173;either to provide ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counseling or to arrange for referral to a ge&#173;ne&#173;ticist or ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counselor. Clinicians now have patients presenting with DNA test results for themselves or their families. The results may range from the identification of high-&#173;risk retinoblastoma gene mutations (which would significantly influence the management of at-&#173;risk &#173;children within the &#173;family) to ge&#173;ne&#173;tic associations that are of no more value than iridology (genes have been associated with iris crypts and furrows). It is impor&#173;tant to understand the clinical settings in which a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic test is crucial, useful, or irrelevant to patient management. &#173;These distinctions &#173;will change in the &#173;future as new clinical &#173;trials define treatments based on ge&#173;ne&#173;tic background.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When a patient pre&#173;sents with a DNA result for a disease for which no effective treatment based on such results is currently available, the clinician may be asked the following question: “What should we do about this?” The best answer is: “Participate in, or help fund, research so we can find out what the best treatments are.” The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) website C<a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">linicalTrials.&#173;gov</a> is a good place to refer &#173;these patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The key recommendations of the AAO Task Force on Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic Testing policy are given at the end of this chapter. When faced with the option&#160;of ordering ge&#173;ne&#173;tic tests, clinicians should ask the same question they ask before ordering any tests: How &#173;will this change management? The best utilization of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing comes from knowledge of the &#173;family history. An accurate &#173;family history might help an ophthalmologist save not only a patient’s sight but also, in cases of retinoblastoma or Marfan syndrome, the patient’s life.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Pedigree Analysis</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Establishing a pedigree or drawing a &#173;family tree is the key to clinical ge&#173;ne&#173;tics. The most useful strategy is to start with open questions, such as, <span class="italic">Are &#173;there any eye diseases in the &#173;family?</span> Then proceed further to more targeted questions, as in the case of potential Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON): <span class="italic">Did any men on the maternal side of your &#173;family lose vision as a young adult?</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">For patients with a &#173;family history, it is best to convert this information into a pedigree diagram—&#173;which can be a challenge in some electronic medical rec&#173;ords. An initial, rough outline can be drawn on paper and the information can be entered into a &#173;simple or more sophisticated pedigree-&#173;drawing software program. The standard protocol for pedigree symbols is outlined in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;6-1</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Drawing one’s own extended &#173;family tree is a useful exercise for the clinician. A basic pedigree should include parents, siblings, and &#173;children and should note &#173;those affected or unaffected by the disorder of interest. Often, specific inquiry of grandparents, &#173;uncles, aunts, and cousins can help clarify the inheritance pattern.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The interviewer should always ascertain &#173;whether &#173;brothers and &#173;sisters are half siblings or full siblings. This procedure may not only limit the pos&#173;si&#173;ble patterns of inheritance, but also identify other individuals at risk for the disorder &#173;under consideration. Information regarding parentage must be pursued aggressively (but always privately and confidentially). Although incest and nonpaternity are sensitive social issues, their occurrence is not rare. Therefore, when considering rare autosomal recessive diseases, the interviewer must ask specifically about consanguinity. Are the parents cousins? Are &#173;there common last names in the families of both parents? &#173;Were the parents born in the same area, or do they belong to known ethnic or religious isolates?</p>
			<p class="body-text">Age at death may be useful in specific situations and can be recorded near the appropriate symbols. In the case of a child with ectopia lentis and no &#173;family history of similar ocular disease, a clinician may find the identification of a relative who died from a dissecting thoracic aorta in his fourth de&#173;cade of life very informative, leading to a tentative consideration of Marfan syndrome in the differential diagnosis. In another example, the clinician’s casual observation of aty&#173;pi&#173;cal tear-&#173;shaped congenital hypertrophy of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) in each eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-2</span>) in a young adult may trigger remembrance that a parent had died at age 50&#160;years from metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon and a sibling from a brain tumor at age 10&#160;years. Taken together, this information may lead to a diagnosis of Gardner syndrome and referral to a gastroenterologist for further diagnostic evaluation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Taking a &#173;family history does not end with the initial consultation &#173;because it may be the first time a patient has heard of the disease. On discussing the new diagnosis with the &#173;family, the patient may discover additional &#173;family history. Clinicians should encourage patients to talk to their families, and then have patients update their &#173;family history at subsequent consultations. For more complicated ge&#173;ne&#173;tic diseases, a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counselor &#173;will be able to assist patients with an extensive pedigree.</p>

			<p class="h1">Patterns of Inheritance</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many of the terms used in this section&#160;are defined in the Ge&#173;ne&#173;tics Glossary in the appendix. See also the section&#160;Terminology: Hereditary, Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic, Familial, Congenital &#173;later in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="h2">Dominant Versus Recessive Inheritance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The terms <span class="italic">dominant</span> and <span class="italic">recessive</span> &#173;were first used by Gregor Mendel. In classical ge&#173;ne&#173;tics, a dominant gene is always expressed with similar phenotype, &#173;whether the mutant gene is pre&#173;sent in a homozygous or heterozygous state. Stated simply, a dominant gene is expressed when pre&#173;sent in only a single copy. A gene is called <span class="italic">recessive</span> if its expression is masked by a normal allele or, more precisely, if it is expressed only in the homozygote (or compound heterozygote) state when both alleles at a specific locus are mutant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">trait</span> is the consequence of the gene’s action. It is the trait, or phenotypic expression of the gene at a clinical level, rather than the gene itself, that is dominant or recessive. A trait is recessive if its expression is suppressed by the presence of a normal gene (as in galactosemia) and dominant if it is apparently unaffected by a single copy of the normal allele (as in Marfan syndrome). If the alleles are dif&#173;fer&#173;ent and yet are both manifested in the phenotype, they are said to be <span class="italic">codominant.</span> Examples of phenotypes with codominant inheritance patterns include the ABO blood types, HLA types, and hemoglobin variants (as involved in sickle cell disease).</p>
			<p class="body-text">As a result of epige&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;factors, a gene may have a greater or lesser effect on the individual or an organ, and therefore the trait may be more or less apparent. Thus, the designation of a trait as &#173;either dominant or recessive depends on the testing method used. Although classically a dominant gene has the same phenotype when the mutant allele is pre&#173;sent in &#173;either the heterozygous or the homozygous state, most dominant medical diseases act more like codominant diseases, in which individuals who are homozygous for a mutant allele or who harbor 2 mutant alleles &#173;will have more severe expression than &#173;will &#173;those with only 1 mutant allele.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In experiments, the biochemical mechanisms of dominant hereditary diseases appear dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from &#173;those of recessive disorders. Recessive traits usually result from enzyme deficiencies caused by mutations of the gene specifying the affected enzyme. The altered enzyme often can be shown to be structurally abnormal or unstable. Heterozygotes usually have approximately 50% of normal enzyme activity but are clinically unaffected, implying that half of the normal enzyme activity is compatible with near-&#173;normal function. If adequate biochemical testing can be performed and the specific enzyme isolated, the reduced enzyme activity can be quantified and the heterozygous ge&#173;ne&#173;tic state inferred. Thus, clinically unaffected heterozygotes can be detected for such disorders as homocystinuria (decrease in cystathionine <span class="greek--tx-"></span>-&#173;synthase), galactokinase deficiency (low blood galactokinase activity), classic galactosemia (galactose-1-&#173;phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency), gyrate atrophy of the choroid and ret&#173;ina (decreased ornithine aminotransferase), and Tay-&#173;Sachs disease (decreased hexosaminidase A). <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;6-1</span> outlines known enzyme disorders with ocular manifestations.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Autosomal Recessive Inheritance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An autosomal recessive disease is expressed fully only in the presence of a mutant gene at the same locus on both homologous chromosomes (ie, homozygosity for a mutant gene) or of 2 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent mutant alleles at the same locus (compound heterozygosity). A single mutant allele is sufficient to cause a recessive disorder if the normal allele on the homologous chromosome is deleted. A recessive trait can remain latent through several generations &#173;until the chance mating of 2 heterozygotes for a mutant allele gives rise to an affected individual. The frequency of heterozygotes (carriers) for a given disorder &#173;will always be considerably greater than that of homozygotes. It is estimated that all &#173;human beings inherit numerous mutations for dif&#173;fer&#173;ent recessive disorders for which they are heterozygotes.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Enzyme defects</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Autosomal recessive diseases often result from defects in enzymatic proteins. Most of the <br />so-&#173;called inborn errors of metabolism that result from enzyme defects are autosomal <br />recessive traits, although a few are X-linked recessive disorders (eg, Lesch-&#173;Nyhan syndrome).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some other disorders with ge&#173;ne&#173;tic blocks in metabolism, the phenotypic consequences are related to the lack of a normal product distal to the block. One example is <span class="italic">albinism,</span> in which the metabolic block involves a step between the amino acid tyrosine and the formation of melanin. In still other inborn errors of metabolism, the phenotypic expression results from excessive production of a product through a normally alternative and minor metabolic pathway.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Carrier heterozygotes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The heterozygous carrier of a mutant gene may show minimal evidence of the gene defect in recessive conditions. However, dysfunction may be evident at a biochemical level. Thus, carrier heterozygotes have been detected by a variety of methods:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">identification of abnormal metabolites by electrophoresis (eg, galactokinase deficiency)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">hair bulb assay (eg, oculocutaneous albinism and Fabry disease)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">monitoring of enzyme activity in leukocytes (eg, galactose-1-&#173;phosphate uridyltransferase in galactosemia)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">skin culture for analy&#173;sis of enzyme activity in fibroblasts (eg, ornithine aminotransferase deficiency in gyrate atrophy of the ret&#173;ina and choroid)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">assay of serum and tears (eg, hexosaminidase A in Tay-&#173;Sachs disease)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">In contrast to the transmission of dominant traits, most reproduction resulting in transmission of recessive disorders involves phenotypically normal heterozygous parents. Among 4 offspring produced by parents carry&#173;ing the same gene for an autosomal recessive disease, on average, 1 &#173;will be affected (homozygote), 2 &#173;will be carriers (heterozygotes), and 1 &#173;will be genet&#173;ically and phenotypically unaffected. Thus, clinically unaffected hetero&#173;zygous parents &#173;will produce offspring with a ratio of 1 clinically affected to 3 clinically normal. &#173;There is no predilection for &#173;either sex. In 2-child families, the patient with a recessive disease is frequently the only affected &#173;family member. For instance, approximately 40%–50% of patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) have no &#173;family history of the disorder. However, their age at onset, rate of progression, and other phenotypic characteristics are similar to &#173;those with defined recessive inheritance patterns.</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-8"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="Operator_BCSC2019_S02_C06_p199_242_2P-web-resources/image/2.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text">This concept has specific implications for ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counseling. All offspring of an affected individual &#173;will be carriers; they are unlikely to be affected with the disorder &#173;unless their clinically unaffected parent is also by chance a carrier of the gene. The normal-&#173;appearing sibling of a child with a recessive disorder has a statistical risk of 2 chances in 3 of being a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic carrier. As the genes for recessive diseases are identified, &#173;these individuals and their offspring &#173;will benefit from predictive DNA testing.</p>
			<p class="h3">Consanguinity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The mating of close relatives can increase the probability that their &#173;children &#173;will inherit a homozygous genotype for recessive traits, particularly relatively rare ones. For example, the probability that the same allele is pre&#173;sent in first cousins is 1&#160;in 8. In the offspring of a first-&#173;cousin sexual &#173;union, 1 of &#173;every 16 genes is commonly pre&#173;sent in a homozygous state. It follows that each offspring from a first-&#173;cousin &#173;union has a 1&#160;in 16 chance of manifesting an autosomal recessive trait within a given &#173;family. Approximately 1% of all sexual &#173;unions may be consanguineous. A vigorous search for consanguinity between the parents should be made in any case of a rare recessive disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In contrast, the expression of common recessive genes is less influenced by inbreeding &#173;because most homozygous offspring are the progeny of unrelated parents. This pattern is usually the case with such frequent disorders as sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis. The characteristics of autosomal recessive inheritance are summarized in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;6-2</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3">Pseudodominance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Occasionally, an affected homozygote mates with a heterozygote. Of their offspring, 50% &#173;will be carriers and 50% &#173;will be affected homozygotes. &#173;Because this segregation pattern mimics that of dominant inheritance, it is called <span class="italic">pseudodominance.</span> Such matings are usually rare and are unlikely to affect more than 2 vertical generations.</p>
			<p class="h2">Autosomal Dominant Inheritance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When an autosomal allele leads to a regular, clearly definable abnormality in the heterozygote, the trait is termed <span class="italic">dominant.</span> Autosomal dominant traits often represent defects in structural nonenzymatic proteins, such as in fibrillin in Marfan syndrome or collagen in Stickler syndrome. In addition, a dominant mode of inheritance has been observed for some malignant neoplastic syndromes, such as retinoblastoma, von Hippel–&#173;Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis, and Gardner syndrome. Although the neoplasias in &#173;these diseases are inherited as autosomal dominant <span class="italic">traits,</span> the defect is recessive at the cellular level, with the tumors arising from loss of function of both alleles.</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-9"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" src="Operator_BCSC2019_S02_C06_p199_242_2P-web-resources/image/3.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text">In dominant inheritance, the heterozygote is clinically affected, and a single mutant gene interferes with normal function. Occasionally, depending on the frequency of the abnormal gene in the population and the phenotype, 2 carriers of the same abnormality produce &#173;children. Any offspring of 2 heterozygous parents has a 25% risk of being an affected homozygote.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It has been suggested that dominant diseases are caused by mutations affecting structural proteins, such as cell receptor growth &#173;factors (eg, <span class="italic">FGFR2</span> in Crouzon syndrome) or by functional deficits generated by abnormal polypeptide subunits (eg, unstable hemoglobins). The dominant disorders aniridia and Waardenburg syndrome result from loss of 1 of the 2 alleles for the developmental transcription &#173;factors PAX6 and PAX3, respectively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some instances, dominantly inherited traits are not clinically expressed. In other instances—&#173;such as in some families with autosomal dominant RP—&#173;pedigree analy&#173;sis can sometimes show a defective gene in individuals who do not manifest any discernible clinical or functional impairment. This situation is called <span class="italic">incomplete penetrance</span> or <span class="italic">skipped generation.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Conclusive evidence of autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance requires demonstration of the disease in at least 3 successive generations. Transmission of the disorder from a male to his male offspring, with both sexes showing the typical disease, must also occur. The characteristics of autosomal dominant inheritance with complete (100%) penetrance are summarized in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;6-3</span>. In the usual clinical situation, any offspring of an affected heterozygote with a dominant disorder, regardless of sex, has a 1&#160;in 2 chance of inheriting the mutant gene and thereby demonstrating some effect. The degree of variability in the expression of certain traits is usually more pronounced in autosomal dominantly inherited disorders than in other types of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorders. Moreover, when a clinical disorder is inherited in more than one mendelian pattern, the dominantly inherited disorder is, in general, clinically less severe than the recessively inherited one.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Counseling for recurrence risk of autosomal dominant traits must involve a thorough examination of not only the affected person (who may have the full syndrome) but also the parents. If 1 parent is even mildly affected, the risk of additional genet&#173;ically affected siblings rises to 50%. It is crucial that ophthalmologists not miss variable expressivity when they have the opportunity to examine the parents of their patient and other &#173;family members. In some ocular disorders, &#173;family members can inherit a gene for a dominant trait and not show clinically apparent manifestations. In &#173;these cases, electrophysiologic testing or ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing can be used to detect the impairment. For example, a relatively inexpensive ge&#173;ne&#173;tic test can show which clinically normal &#173;family members carry the mutation for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy.</p>
			<p class="h2">X-&#173;Linked Inheritance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A trait determined by genes on &#173;either of the sex chromosomes is properly termed <span class="italic">sex-&#173;linked.</span> This ge&#173;ne&#173;tic pattern became widely known with the occurrence of hemophilia in Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean and Rus&#173;sian royal families.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The rules governing all modes of sex-&#173;linked inheritance can be derived logically by considering the chromosomal basis. Females have 2 X chromosomes, 1 of which &#173;will go to each ovum. Males have both an X and a Y chromosome. The male parent contributes his only X chromosome to all his &#173;daughters and his only Y chromosome to all his sons. Traits determined by genes carried on the Y chromosome are transmitted from a &#173;father to 100% of his sons. Among &#173;these Y chromosomal genes is the <span class="italic">testis-&#173;determining &#173;factor</span> (<span class="italic">TDF;</span> also called <span class="italic">sex-&#173;determining region Y,</span> or <span class="italic">SRY</span>). Genes controlling tooth size, stature, spermatogenesis, and hairy pinnae (hypertrichosis pinnae auris) are also on the Y chromosome. All other sex-&#173;linked traits or diseases are thought to result from genes on the X chromosome and are properly termed <span class="italic">X-linked.</span> Some&#160;X-linked conditions have considerable frequencies in &#173;human populations; congenital color vision defects such as protan and deutan anomalies &#173;were also among the first &#173;human traits assigned to a specific chromosome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The distinctive feature of X-linked inheritance, both dominant and recessive, is the absence of father-&#173;to-&#173;son transmission. &#173;Because the male X chromosome passes only to &#173;daughters, all &#173;daughters of an affected male &#173;will inherit the mutant gene.</p>
			<p class="h3">X-&#173;linked recessive inheritance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A male has only 1 copy of any X-linked gene and therefore is said to be <span class="italic">hemizygous</span> for the gene, rather than homozygous or heterozygous. &#173;Because &#173;there is no normal gene to balance a mutant X-linked gene in the male, its resulting phenotype, &#173;whether dominant or recessive, &#173;will always be expressed. A female may be heterozygous or homozygous for a mutant X-linked gene. X-linked traits are commonly called <span class="italic">recessive</span> if they are caused by genes located on the X chromosome, as &#173;these genes express themselves fully only in the absence of the normal allele. Thus, males (with their single X chromosome) are predominantly affected. All their phenotypically healthy but heterozygous &#173;daughters are carriers. By contrast, each son of a heterozygous &#173;woman has an equal chance of being unaffected or hemizygously affected.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A female &#173;will be affected with an X-linked recessive trait &#173;under a &#173;limited number of circumstances:</p>
			<ul>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;6-4</span> summarizes the characteristics of X-linked recessive inheritance. X-linked recessive inheritance should be considered when all affected individuals in a &#173;family are males, especially when they are related through historically unaffected &#173;women (eg, &#173;uncle and nephew, or multiple affected half &#173;brothers with dif&#173;fer&#173;ent &#173;fathers). Many&#160;X-linked RP pedigrees have been mislabeled as autosomal dominant &#173;because of manifesting female carriers. The key feature of an X-linked pedigree is no male-&#173;to-&#173;male transmission.</p>
			<p class="h3">X-&#173;linked dominant inheritance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">X-&#173;linked dominant traits are caused by mutant genes expressed in a single dose and carried on the X chromosome. Thus, both heterozygous &#173;women and hemizygous men are clinically affected. Females are affected nearly twice as frequently as males. All &#173;daughters of males with the disease are affected. However, all sons of affected males are &#173;free of the trait &#173;unless their &#173;mothers are also affected. &#173;Because only &#173;children of affected males provide information in discriminating X-linked dominant from autosomal dominant disease, it may be impossible to distinguish &#173;these modes on ge&#173;ne&#173;tic grounds when the pedigree is small or the available data are scarce. Some&#160;X-linked dominant disorders, such as incontinentia pigmenti (Bloch-&#173;Sulzberger syndrome), may prove lethal to the hemizygous male. The characteristics of X-linked dominant inheritance are summarized in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;6-5</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3">X-&#173;linked disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Females with X-linked diseases have milder symptoms than males. Occasionally, males may be so severely affected that they die before the reproductive period, thus preventing transmission of the gene. Such is the case with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, in which most affected males die before their midteens. In other disorders, males are so severely affected that they die before birth, and only females survive. Families with such disorders would include only affected &#173;daughters, unaffected &#173;daughters, and normal sons at a ratio of 1:1:1. Incontinentia pigmenti is one such lethal ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorder. In affected females, an erythematous, vesicular skin eruption develops perinatally, which progresses to marbled, curvilinear pigmentation. The syndrome includes dental abnormalities, congenital or secondary cataracts, ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization with tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, and pseudogliomas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Among the most severe X-linked dominant disorders with lethality for the hemizygous males is Aicardi syndrome. No verified birth of a male with this entity has ever been reported. Females have profound cognitive disabilities and delays; muscular hypotonia; blindness associated with a characteristic lacunar juxtapapillary chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal dysplasia and optic disc anomalies; and central ner&#173;vous system (CNS) abnormalities, the most common characteristic of which is agenesis of the corpus callosum. No recurrences have been reported among siblings, and parents can be reassured that the risk in subsequent &#173;children is minimal. All instances of the disease appear to arise from a new X-dominant lethal mutation, and affected females do not survive long enough to reproduce. The distal end of the short arm of the X chromosome appears to be the crucial area, &#173;because some patients with a deletion in this region have also been shown to have features of Aicardi syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Maternal Inheritance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When nearly all offspring of an affected &#173;woman appear to be at risk for inheriting and expressing a trait, and the &#173;daughters are at risk for passing on the trait to the next generation, the pattern of inheritance is called <span class="italic">maternal inheritance.</span> The disease stops with all-&#173;male offspring, &#173;whether affected or not. This form of inheritance is highly suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder. The structure and molecular aspects of the mitochondrial genome and a general discussion of mitochondrial disease are covered in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Terminology: Hereditary, Genetic, Familial, Congenital</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Hereditary</span> indicates that a disease or trait &#173;under consideration results directly from an individual’s par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar ge&#173;ne&#173;tic composition (or <span class="italic">genome</span>) and that it can be passed from one generation to another. <span class="italic">Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic</span> denotes that the disorder is caused by a defect of genes, &#173;whether acquired or inherited. In some instances, such as mutations in genes related to ocular melanoma, the disease is clearly ge&#173;ne&#173;tic, but it is not passed to subsequent generations and is therefore not hereditary. Thus, the terms <span class="italic">hereditary</span> and <span class="italic">ge&#173;ne&#173;tic</span> are not synonymous but are sometimes used to convey similar concepts. Both hereditary and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorders may be congenital or develop &#173;later in life.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A condition is <span class="italic">familial</span> if it occurs in more than one member of a &#173;family. It may, of course, be hereditary but need not be. A familial disorder can be caused by common exposure to infectious agents (eg, adenoviral conjunctivitis), excess food intake (eg, obesity), or environmental agents, such as cigarette smoke. Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;factors, however, may contribute to the effects of exposure to &#173;these environmental &#173;factors and may cloud the picture.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The term <span class="italic">congenital</span> refers to characteristics pre&#173;sent at birth. &#173;These characteristics may be hereditary or familial, or they may occur as an isolated event, often as the result of an infection (eg, rubella, toxoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus) or a toxic agent (eg, as in thalidomide embryopathy or fetal alcohol syndrome). The presence of such characteristics <span class="italic">at birth</span> or shortly &#173;after (in the first weeks of life) is the defining &#173;factor. Pediatric ophthalmology lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture has traditionally used the terms <span class="italic">congenital nystagmus</span>, <span class="italic">congenital esotropia</span>, <span class="italic">congenital glaucoma</span>, and <span class="italic">congenital cataract</span>; however, in many cases, &#173;these disorders are not pre&#173;sent at birth and would be more accurately referred to as <span class="italic">infantile.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Heritability</span> refers to the proportion of phenotypic variation in a population that is attributable to ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variation among individuals. Estimation of heritability aims to answer the “nature versus nurture” debate and to allow researchers to pursue ge&#173;ne&#173;tic and/or environmental determinants of disease, although most cases involve a combination of the 2 determinants. Heritability studies compare the phenotypic similarity of genet&#173;ically closely related individuals with that of less closely related individuals. The best example of this type of study is a comparison of the correlation of identical twins (monozygotic twins, who share 100% of their DNA sequence) with that of nonidentical twins (dizygotic twins, who share 50% of their DNA sequence). With both twins sharing the same age and similar intrauterine and early childhood environments, most of the variation is thought to be due to ge&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;factors. An example of a twin study concerning the highly heritable trait of central corneal thickness is shown in <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;6-3</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A condition known to be ge&#173;ne&#173;tic and hereditary (eg, RP) may appear in only 1 individual of a &#173;family. Such an individual is said to have a <span class="italic">simplex,</span> or <span class="italic">isolated,</span> form of a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disease. A genet&#173;ically determined trait may be isolated in the pedigree for several reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-11">The pedigree is small.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The full expression of the disease has not been sought or has not manifested in other relatives.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The disorder represents a new ge&#173;ne&#173;tic mutation or chromosomal change.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The disorder is recessive, and the investigation to determine &#173;whether the parents are carriers has been inadequate.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-12">&#173;There is nonpaternity.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Clinically similar disorders may be inherited in several dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ways. For example, RP can occur from an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked recessive, or mitochondrial mutation. &#173;These vari&#173;ous ge&#173;ne&#173;tic forms represent distinct gene defects with dif&#173;fer&#173;ent alterations in gene structure and vari&#173;ous biochemical pathogeneses, each of which has similar clinical phenotypic expressions. Clarification of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic heterogeneity is impor&#173;tant, &#173;because only with the proper diagnosis and correct identification of the inheritance pattern can appropriate ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counseling and prognosis be offered.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorders originally thought to be a single and unique entity are found, on close scrutiny, to be two or more fundamentally distinct entities. Further clarification of the inheritance pattern or biochemical analy&#173;sis permits separation of initially similar disorders. Such has been the case for Marfan syndrome and homocystinuria. Patients with &#173;these disorders tend to be tall and thin, with long arms, legs, fin&#173;gers, and toes; they also have ectopia lentis. However, the presence of dominant inheritance, aortic aneurysms, and valvular heart disease in Marfan syndrome distinguishes it from the recessive pattern and thromboembolic disease of homocystinuria.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic heterogeneity</span> is a general term that applies to the phenotypic similarity that may be produced by two or more fundamentally distinct ge&#173;ne&#173;tic entities; this term implies that the genes are nonallelic. Leber congenital amaurosis, which has more than 14 causative genes, is a good example (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-4)</span>. Once the location on a chromosome is determined for a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar disease gene, and the gene’s molecular structure is identified, most examples of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic heterogeneity cease to be a prob&#173;lem for diagnosis or classification. However, clinical, allelic, and locus heterogeneity can remain perplexing issues. For example, mutations of the Norrie disease gene, <span class="italic">NDP,</span> usually result in the typical phenotype of pseudoglioma from exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments, but some <span class="italic">NDP</span> mutations have been associated with X-linked exudative vitreoretinopathy without any systemic associations.</p>

			<p class="h1">Genes and Chromosomes</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The word <span class="italic">gene</span> comes from the Greek <span class="italic">genes</span> (“giving birth to”) and is used as a term for individual units of hereditary information. Genes are the basic units of inheritance and include the sequence of nucleotides that codes for a single trait or a single polypeptide chain and its associated regulatory regions. &#173;Human genes vary substantially in size, from approximately 500 base pairs (bp) to more than 2 million bp. However, more than 98% of &#173;human genes range in size from less than 10 kilobase pairs (kb; 1 kb <span class="symbol">=</span> 1000 bp) to 500 kb. Many are considerably larger than 50 kb. Whereas a single &#173;human cell contains enough DNA for 6 million genes, approximately 20,000–25,000 genes are found among the 23 pairs of known chromosomes. Although the remaining 95% of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic material is likely to be involved in the regulation of gene expression, its precise function is largely unknown.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The relative sequence of the genes, which are arranged linearly along the chromosome, is called the <span class="italic">ge&#173;ne&#173;tic map.</span> The physical position or region on a chromosome occupied by a single gene is known as a <span class="italic">locus.</span> The physical contiguity of vari&#173;ous gene loci becomes the vehicle for close association of genes with one another <span class="italic">(linkage)</span> and their clustering in groups that characteristically move together or separately <span class="italic">(segregation)</span> from one generation to the next.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Each normal &#173;human somatic cell has 46 chromosomes composed of 23 homologous pairs. Each member of a homologous pair carries matched, though not necessarily identical, genes in the same sequence. One member of each chromosome pair is inherited from the &#173;father, and the other from the &#173;mother. Each normal sperm or ovum contains 23 chromosomes, 1 representative from each pair; thus, each parent transmits half of his or her ge&#173;ne&#173;tic information to each child. Of the 46 chromosomes, 44 are called <span class="italic">autosomes</span> &#173;because they provide information on somatic characteristics; the remaining 2 chromosomes are X and Y (see the section&#160;X-Linked Inheritance &#173;earlier in this chapter).</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is impor&#173;tant to know &#173;whether genes are located on the X chromosome, mitochondrial DNA, or the autosomes; however, &#173;there is rarely any clinical value in knowing in which autosome (1–22) a gene is located. In the past, when only a few eye disease genes &#173;were known or just the location of a gene was known, clinicians often remembered the chromosomal locations. Now, with certain diseases, such as RP, &#173;there are so many genes even ophthalmic ge&#173;ne&#173;ticists do not remember them all. Information on genes, including their chromosomal locations, can be readily found in electronic databases, such as OMIM (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim">https://&#173;www.&#173;ncbi.&#173;nlm.&#173;nih.&#173;gov/&#173;omim</a>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Alleles</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The alternative forms of a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar gene at the same locus on each of an identical pair of chromosomes are called <span class="italic">alleles</span> (Greek for <span class="italic">reciprocals</span>). If both members of a pair of alleles for a given autosomal locus are identical (ie, the DNA sequence is the same), the individual is <span class="italic">homozygous</span> (a <span class="italic">homozygote</span>). If the allelic genes are distinct from each other (ie, the DNA sequence differs), the individual is <span class="italic">heterozygous</span> (a <span class="italic">heterozygote</span>). Dif&#173;fer&#173;ent gene defects can cause dramatically dif&#173;fer&#173;ent phenotypes and still be allelic. For example, sickle cell disease (SS hemoglobinopathy) caused by homozygosity of 1 mutant gene is substantially dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from the phenotypic expression of SC hemoglobinopathy, yet the <span class="italic">Hb&#160;S</span> gene and the <span class="italic">Hb&#160;C</span> gene are allelic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The term <span class="italic">polyallelism</span> refers to the many pos&#173;si&#173;ble variants or mutations of a single gene. Mutant proteins that correspond to mutant alleles frequently possess slightly dif&#173;fer&#173;ent biochemical properties. Among the mucopolysaccharidoses, for example, the enzyme <span class="greek--tx-"></span>-&#173;<span class="smallcaps_CAPS">L</span>-&#173;iduronidase is defective in both Hurler and Scheie syndromes. &#173;Because &#173;these disorders stem from mutations of the same gene, they are abnormalities of the same enzyme and are, thus, allelic. However, the clinical severity of &#173;these 2 disorders (age at onset; age at detection; and severity of affliction of skeleton, liver, spleen, and cornea) is entirely dif&#173;fer&#173;ent, presumably &#173;because the function of the mutant enzyme is less altered by the Scheie syndrome mutation. &#173;Because the enzyme is a protein composed of hundreds of amino acids, a mutation resulting in a base substitution within a certain codon might cause a change in one or more amino acids in a portion of the enzyme remote from its active site, thus reducing its effect on the enzyme’s function. However, the substitution of 1 amino acid at a crucial location in the enzyme’s active site might abolish most or all of its enzymatic activity. Several examples of allelic disorders appear among the mucopolysaccharidoses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The phenotype of the usual heterozygote is determined by 1 mutant allele and 1 “normal” allele. However, the genotype of a compound heterozygote comprises 2 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent mutant alleles, each at the same locus. The ge&#173;ne&#173;tic Hurler-&#173;Scheie compound hetero&#173;zygote is biochemically proven and clinically manifests features intermediate between those in the homozygotes of the 2 alleles. Whenever detailed biochemical analy&#173;sis is performed, the products of the 2 alleles manifest slightly dif&#173;fer&#173;ent properties (eg, rates of enzyme activity or electrophoretic migration).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In contrast, and as noted &#173;earlier, some ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorders originally thought to be single and unique may, on close scrutiny, reveal two or more fundamentally distinct entities. Occasionally, this ge&#173;ne&#173;tic heterogeneity is observed with diseases that are inherited in the same manner, such as tyrosinase-&#173;negative and tyrosinase-&#173;positive oculocutaneous albinism. &#173;Because &#173;these 2 conditions are phenotypically similar and each is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, it was formerly assumed that they &#173;were allelic. When a tyrosinase-&#173;negative person with albinism bears &#173;children with a tyrosinase-&#173;positive person with albinism, the offspring appear clinically normal. This observation excludes the possibility that &#173;these 2 conditions are allelic: each form of albinism occurs only when an offspring is homozygous for one of the genes causing the condition. Defects in separate gene loci (the tyrosinase gene and the <span class="italic">P</span> gene) are now known to cause oculocutaneous albinism. The offspring of individuals with phenotypically similar but genotypically dif&#173;fer&#173;ent disorders are called <span class="italic">double heterozygotes</span> &#173;because they are heterozygous for each of the 2 loci.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Mitosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A cell may undergo 2 types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis gives rise to the multiple generations of genet&#173;ically identical cells needed for the growth and maintenance of the organism. When mitosis is about to begin, the cell accurately duplicates all of its chromosomes. The replicated chromosomes then separate into 2 identical groups that migrate apart and eventually reach opposite sides of the cell. The cell and its contents then divide, forming 2 genet&#173;ically identical &#173;daughter cells, each with the same diploid chromosome number and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic information as the parent cell.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Meiosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In contrast to mitosis, meiosis leads to the production of cells that have only 1 member of each chromosome pair (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-5</span>). The specialized cells that arise from meiosis and participate in sexual reproduction are called <span class="italic">gametes.</span> The male gamete is a sperm, and the female gamete, an ovum. During meiosis, a modified sequence of divisions systematically reduces the number of chromosomes in each cell by one-&#173;half to the <span class="italic">haploid</span> number. Consequently, each gamete contains 23 chromosomes, 1 representative of each pair. This assortment occurs randomly, except that 1 representative of each pair of chromosomes is incorporated into each sperm or egg.</p>
			<p class="body-text">At conception, a sperm and an ovum unite, forming a <span class="italic">zygote,</span> a single cell that contains 46 chromosomes. &#173;Because both parents contribute equally to the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic makeup of their offspring, new and often advantageous gene combinations may emerge.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Segregation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Two allelic genes, which occupy the same gene locus on 2 homologous chromosomes, separate with the division of the 2 chromosomes during meiosis, and each goes to a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent gamete. Thus, the genes are said to <span class="italic">segregate,</span> a property &#173;limited to allelic genes, which cannot occur together in a single offspring of the &#173;bearer. For example, if a parent is a compound heterozygote for both hemoglobin S and hemoglobin C, which occupy the same ge&#173;ne&#173;tic locus on homologous chromosomes, then none of the offspring &#173;will inherit both hemoglobins from that parent; each &#173;will inherit &#173;either one or the other.</p>
			<p class="h2">In&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent Assortment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Genes on dif&#173;fer&#173;ent <span class="italic">(nonhomologous)</span> chromosomes may or may not separate together during meiotic cell division. This random pro&#173;cess, called <span class="italic">in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent assortment,</span> states that nonallelic genes assort in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dently of one another. &#173;Because <span class="italic">crossing over</span> (exchange of chromosomal material between the members of a pair of homologous chromosomes) can occur in meiosis, 2 nonallelic genes originally on opposite members of the chromosomal pair may end up together on &#173;either of the 2 or may remain separated, depending on their original positions and on the sites of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic interchange. Thus, the gametes of an individual with 2 nonallelic dominant traits, or <span class="italic">syntenic traits,</span> located on the same chromosome could produce 4 pos&#173;si&#173;ble offspring. A child may inherit</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">both traits, if the separate alleles remain on the same chromosome and the child inherits this chromosome</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">neither trait, if the genes remain on 1 chromosome but the child inherits the opposite chromosome with neither allele</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">only 1 of the 2 alleles, if crossing over occurred between the loci, and the child receives the chromosome with that par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar allele</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This scheme for nonallelic traits depends on the in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent assortment of chromosomes in the first division of meiosis. Approximately 50 crossovers (1–3 per chromosome) occur during an average meiotic division.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Linkage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Linkage is the major exception or modification to the law of in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent assortment. Genes located reasonably closely together on the same chromosome tend to be transmitted together, from generation to generation, more frequently than chance alone would allow for; therefore, they are said to be linked. The closer together the 2 loci are, the less likely they are to be affected by crossovers. Linear physical proximity along a chromosome cannot be considered an automatic guarantor of linkage, however. In fact, certain sites on each chromosome may be more vulnerable to homologous crossing over than &#173;others.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-14">Mutations</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Change in the structure or sequence of a gene is called a <span class="italic">mutation.</span> A mutation can occur randomly anywhere along the DNA sequence of a gene and may result when one nucleotide is substituted for another <span class="italic">(point mutation).</span> A mutation that occurs in a noncoding portion of the gene may or may not be of clinical consequence. Similarly, a mutation may structurally alter a protein but in a manner that does not notably compromise its function. A new mutation that compromises function may appear in a given gene as the gene is transmitted from parent to offspring.</p>
			<p class="body-text">More gross mutations may involve deletion, translocation, insertion, or internal duplication of a portion of the DNA. Some mutations cause &#173;either destruction of the offspring or sterility. &#173;Others are less harmful or are potentially beneficial and become established in subsequent generations. Mutations can occur spontaneously for reasons that are not understood. They may also be induced by exposure to a variety of environmental agents called <span class="italic">mutagens,</span> such as radiation, viruses, and certain chemicals.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Mutations may arise in somatic as well as germinal cells, but &#173;these are not transmitted to subsequent generations. Somatic mutations in &#173;humans are difficult to identify, although some account for the inception of certain forms of neoplasia (eg, retinoblastoma).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-15">Polymorphisms</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many base changes have &#173;little or no deleterious effect on the organism. A <span class="italic">polymorphism</span> is defined as the occurrence of 2 or more alleles at a specific locus with a frequency greater than 1% each in a given population. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are impor&#173;tant for gene mapping in genome-&#173;wide association studies (GWAS).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-5">Genome, Genotype, Phenotype</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The genome is the sum of the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic material within a cell or an organism—&#173;thus, the total ge&#173;ne&#173;tic endowment. By contrast, the genotype defines the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic constitution, and thus biological capability, with regard to a specific locus (eg, individual blood groups or a specific single enzyme). Phenotype indicates the observable or manifest physical, physiologic, biochemical, or molecular characteristics of an individual, which are determined by the genotype but can be modified by the environment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A clinical picture produced entirely by environmental &#173;factors that nevertheless closely resembles, or is even identical to, a phenotype is known as a <span class="italic">phenocopy.</span> Thus, for example, the pigmentary retinopathy of congenital rubella has occasionally been confused with a hereditary dystrophic disorder of the ret&#173;ina, RP.&#160;Similarly, amiodarone-&#173;induced changes in the corneal epithelium resemble &#173;those observed as cornea verticillata in the X-linked dystrophic disorder Fabry disease.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Single-&#173;Gene Disorders</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Approximately 4500 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent diseases are known to be caused by a defect in a single gene. As a group, &#173;these disorders are called <span class="italic">monogenic,</span> or <span class="italic">mendelian,</span> diseases. They most often show 1 of 3 patterns of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. Disorders of mitochondrial DNA are inherited in a fourth manner, termed <span class="italic">maternal inheritance.</span></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Anticipation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Variability</span> is an intrinsic property of &#173;human ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disease that reflects the quantitative and qualitative differences in phenotype among individuals with the “same” mutant allele. Even within a single &#173;family with a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disease, each affected individual may manifest the disease to a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent degree, with dif&#173;fer&#173;ent features, or at a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent age. For example, &#173;there is wide variation in both severity and age at detection of features of myotonic dystrophy (also called <span class="italic">Steinert disease</span>), which include motor myotonia, cataracts, gonadal atrophy, and presenile baldness. Even within a single &#173;family, the characteristic cataracts may begin to affect vision at any time from the second to the seventh de&#173;cade of life.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Such variability of clinical manifestation led to the concept of <span class="italic">anticipation,</span> the phenomenon of apparently &#173;earlier and more severe onset of a disease in successive generations within a &#173;family. Before 1990, most ge&#173;ne&#173;ticists thought that anticipation was not a biological phenomenon but rather an artifact of ascertainment. With the relatively recent discovery of triplet or trinucleotide tandem-&#173;repeat expansion diseases, anticipation has been shown to reflect the increased length of trinucleotide tandem repeats from one generation to the next. Anticipation occurs in autosomal dominant disorders. Myotonic dystrophy, fragile X syndrome, Huntington disease, and Kennedy disease (a form of spinobulbar muscular atrophy) are some of the diseases whose discovery contributed to the rejuvenation of the concept of anticipation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some &#173;human variability may result from the intrinsic differences in the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic background of &#173;every &#173;human being. Other recognizable or presumptive influences on the variable intra-&#173; or interfamilial phenotype of the same gene include the following &#173;factors:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">sex influences or limitations</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">maternal &#173;factors, such as intrauterine environment and even cytoplasmic (eg, mitochondrial) inheritance &#173;factors</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">modifying loci</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ge&#173;ne&#173;tic heterogeneity, including both isoalleles and genocopies</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">gene alterations induced &#173;either by position effects with other genes or by somatic mutations</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">epige&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;factors, methylation, and histone formation</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Obviously, nonge&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;factors (eg, diet, temperature, and drugs) may affect gene expression, &#173;either as phenocopies or through ecologic par&#173;ameters.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-17">Penetrance</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The presence or absence of any effect of a gene is called <span class="italic">penetrance.</span> If a gene generates any evidence of phenotypic features, no &#173;matter how minimal, it is termed <span class="italic">penetrant.</span> If it is not expressed at any level of detection, it is termed <span class="italic">nonpenetrant.</span></p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In families with an autosomal dominant mutant gene that has 100% penetrance of the phenotype, an average of 50% of the offspring &#173;will inherit the gene and show evidence of the disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although penetrance has an exact statistical definition, its clinical ascertainment is affected by diagnostic awareness and the methods of physical examination. For example, many mild cases of Marfan syndrome would be missed without careful biomicroscopy of the fully dilated pupil and echocardiography of the heart valves and &#173;great vessels. Similarly, if the criteria for identification of the retinoblastoma gene include indirect ophthalmoscopy and scleral depression, some “nonpenetrant” parents or siblings in families with “dominantly inherited” retinoblastoma may be found to have a spontaneously involuted tumor, which clearly identifies them as &#173;bearers of the gene. In another example, some &#173;family members who have a gene for Best macular dystrophy &#173;will be identified not by clinical ophthalmoscopic examination but only by electro-&#173;oculographic testing. Therefore, in examining a potential &#173;bearer of a gene, the examiner must carefully search for any manifestations of the gene’s effects in all susceptible tissues before dismissing someone as from a “skipped generation.”</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-17">Expressivity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The presence of a defective gene does not necessarily imply a complete expression of &#173;every potential manifestation. The variety of ways and levels of severity in which a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar ge&#173;ne&#173;tic trait manifests among dif&#173;fer&#173;ent affected individuals is called <span class="italic">expressiv</span><span class="italic">ity.</span> In neurofibromatosis (NF) 1, for example, an affected child may have only Lisch nodules of the iris and caf<span class="accent">é</span>-&#173;au-&#173;lait spots.

			<p class="body-text">Differences in the age at onset of clinical manifestations are one way that dominant disorders demonstrate expressivity. For example, in NF1, an affected individual may have the following sequence: only caf<span class="accent">é</span>-&#173;au-&#173;lait spots at birth, Lisch nodules that gradually increase in number and size at about age 5–10&#160;years, punctiform neurofibromas of the skin in early adolescence, subareolar neurofibromas &#173;after puberty (females), and visual impairment from the effect of an optic glioma in the late teenaged years. Although all of &#173;these features are phenotypic components of the mutant gene, each feature has a characteristic age at onset and a natu&#173;ral history of growth and effect within the umbrella of the total disease. See the section “Ge&#173;ne&#173;tics of the phakomatoses” for additional discussion of NF1.</p>

			<div id="Chapt6_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Cytoge&#173;ne&#173;tics</span> is the branch of ge&#173;ne&#173;tics concerned with the study of chromosomes and their properties. Chromosomal defects are changes in the chromosome number or structure that damage sensitive ge&#173;ne&#173;tic functions and lead to developmental or reproductive disorders. &#173;These defects usually result from (1) a disruption of the mechanisms controlling chromosome movement during cell division; or (2) alterations of chromosome structure that lead to changes in the number or arrangement of genes or to abnormal chromosomal be&#173;hav&#173;ior.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chromosomal abnormalities occur in approximately 1 of 200 term pregnancies and in 1%–2% of all pregnancies involving parents older than 35&#160;years. About 7% of perinatal deaths and some 40%–50% of retrievable spontaneous abortuses have significant chromosomal aberrations. Virtually any change in chromosome number during early development profoundly affects the formation of tissues and organs and the viability of the entire organism. Most major chromosomal disorders are characterized by both developmental delay and cognitive disability, as well as a variety of somatic abnormalities.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-17">Indications for and Types of Chromosome Analy&#173;sis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ophthalmologists should be aware of the value of learning the constitutional and tumor karyotypes for infants with retinoblastoma, especially if the tumor represents a new ge&#173;ne&#173;tic mutation. Chromosome analy&#173;sis (also called <span class="italic">karyotyping</span>) is also suggested in patients with isolated (nonfamilial) aniridia (which is often associated with Wilms tumor) and other systemic malformations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A chromosomally abnormal state in a previous child warrants consideration of amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling for prenatal diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies to avoid the risk of recurrence. An alternative is the use of preimplantation ge&#173;ne&#173;tic diagnosis (discussed &#173;later in the chapter, &#173;under Reproductive Issues).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-14">Karyotype</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The systematic display of chromosomes from a single somatic cell is called a <span class="italic">karyotype.</span> Chromosome preparations are most commonly obtained from peripheral venous blood, although bone marrow, skin fibroblasts, and cells from amniotic fluid or chorionic villi are useful &#173;under specific circumstances. Chromosome analy&#173;sis can be obtained directly from neoplastic tissues, as in retinoblastoma and Wilms tumor, for example.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Fluorescence in situ hybridization and chromosome arm painting</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique, DNA fragments from genes of interest are first tagged with a fluo&#173;rescent compound and then annealed or hybridized to chromosomes. In the pro&#173;cess of chromosome arm painting, the regions of interest are stained to determine &#173;whether duplication, deletion, or rearrangement has occurred. Such fluo&#173;rescent molecular probes can be used to detect and often quantify the presence of specific DNA sequences on a chromosome and can identify microscopic abnormalities that would be indiscernible by conventional cytoge&#173;ne&#173;tic methods.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Using microdissections of chromosomal regions and FISH, probes have been developed that label entire arms of chromosomes and each of the individual chromosomes (multicolor spectral karyotyping and combinatorial multifluor FISH). With 2-color FISH, both arms of each chromosome can be labeled si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-6</span>). &#173;These probes are valuable for detecting and understanding the mechanisms of complex chromosomal rearrangement.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-17">Aneuploidy of Autosomes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Aneuploidy</span> denotes an abnormal number of chromosomes in cells. The presence of 3 homologous chromosomes in a cell, rather than the normal pair, is termed <span class="italic">trisomy. Monosomy</span> is the presence of only 1 member of any pair of autosomes or only 1 sex chromosome. The absence of a single autosome is almost always lethal to the embryo; an extra autosome is often catastrophic to surviving embryos. Aneuploidy of sex chromosomes (eg, X, XXX, XXY, and XYY) is less disastrous. Monosomies and trisomies are generally caused by mechanical accidents that increase or decrease the number of chromosomes in the gametes. The most common type of accident, meiotic <span class="italic">nondisjunction,</span> results from a disruption of chromosome movement during meiosis (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;6-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Trisomy 21 syndrome, or Down syndrome, is the most common chromosomal syndrome in &#173;humans; it has an overall incidence of 1:800 live births. Clinical features of this syndrome have been well known since John Langdon Down originally described them in 1866.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most impor&#173;tant risk &#173;factor for having a child with Down syndrome is maternal age. The frequency of Down syndrome increases from approximately 1:1400 live births for &#173;mothers aged 20–24&#160;years to approximately 1:40 live births for &#173;mothers aged 44&#160;years. However, the frequency of Down syndrome is greater (1:1250) for &#173;mothers between 15 and 19&#160;years of age than it is in the next-&#173;higher age range. Above age 50&#160;years, the frequency is 1:11 live births. The eponym <span class="italic">Down syndrome</span> summarizes a clinical description of certain distinctive, if variable, phenotypic features whereas the karyotype describes the chromosomal constitution of the cells and tissues studied.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In more than 80% of Down syndrome cases, the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic error occurs in meiosis I (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>); and in more than 95% of cases, the error occurs in maternal rather than paternal meiosis. Approximately 5% of patients with Down syndrome have a <span class="italic">translocation</span> resulting from attachment of the long arm of chromosome 21 to the long arm of another acrocentric chromosome, usually 14 or 22. &#173;These translocations cause pairing prob&#173;lems during meiosis, and the translocated fragment of chromosome 21 appears in one of the &#173;daughter cells along with a normal chromosome 21. As in nondisjunction, the fragment becomes trisomic on fertilization. Trisomy of only the distal one-&#173;third of chromosome arm 21q is sufficient to cause the disorder. Genes that lie within the q22 band of chromosome 21 appear to be specifically responsible for the pathogenesis of Down syndrome.</p>

			<p class="h2">Mosaicism</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Occasionally, an individual or a tissue contains two or more cell lines with distinctly dif&#173;fer&#173;ent chromosomal constitutions. Such individuals or tissues are termed <span class="italic">mosaics.</span> Sometimes the peripheral blood, which is the usual source for chromosomal analy&#173;sis, contains populations of cells with completely dif&#173;fer&#173;ent chromosomal constitutions. One population of cells may be so infrequent that a second tissue, such as skin fibroblasts, must be analyzed to demonstrate the mosaicism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical effects of mosaicism are difficult to predict &#173;because the distribution of abnormal cells in the embryo is determined by the timing of the error and other variables. If mitotic nondisjunction immediately follows conception, the zygote divides into 2 abnormal cells: 1 trisomic and 1 monosomic. The monosomic cells rarely survive and may decrease in number or even dis&#173;appear entirely over time. Mitotic nondisjunction may occur when the embryo is composed of a small population of cells. Thus, 3 populations of cells are established—1 normal and 2 abnormal—&#173;although some abnormal cell lines may be “discarded” or lost during development. If mitotic nondisjunction occurs at a more advanced stage of development, resulting abnormal populations constitute a minority of the embryo’s cells, and mosaicism may have &#173;little or no mea&#173;sur&#173;able effect on development.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A small population of aneuploid mosaic cells may not have a direct effect on development. However, when cells of this type occur in the reproductive tissues of other&#173;wise unaffected &#173;people, some of the gametes may carry extra chromosomes or may be missing some entirely. Consequently, mosaic parents tend to be at high risk for having chromosomally abnormal &#173;children.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common example of autosomal mosaicism is <span class="italic">trisomy 21 mosaicism.</span> Some patients with trisomy 21 mosaicism have the typical features of Down syndrome; &#173;others show no abnormalities in appearance or intelligence. The crucial variables seem to be the frequency and the embryologic distribution of the trisomic cells during early development, which do not necessarily correlate with the percentage of trisomic cells in any one tissue, such as peripheral blood.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several types of sex chromosome mosaicism may occur. Again, the physical effects tend to vary, prob&#173;ably reflecting the quantity and distribution of the abnormal cells during development. For example, the cell population that lacks 1 of the X chromosomes can arise in a female embryo, leading to 45,X/46,XX mosaicism. In some cases, &#173;these patients develop normally; in other cases, some or all of the features of Turner syndrome appear. Similarly, the Y chromosome may be lost in some cells of a developing male embryo. This produces 45,X/46,XY mosaicism. Persons with X/XY mosaicism may develop as phenotypically unaffected males, as females with the features of Turner syndrome, or as individuals with physical characteristics intermediate between the sexes (<span class="italic">intersexes</span> or <span class="italic">pseudohermaphrodites</span>).</p>

			<p class="h3-h2">Short arm 11 deletion (11p13) syndrome: aniridia</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When working with a new patient with aniridia, the ophthalmologist should, if pos&#173;si&#173;ble, conduct a careful examination of the patient’s parents for the variable expression of autosomal dominant aniridia. Although almost all cases of aniridia result from <span class="italic">PAX6</span> mutations, a rare autosomal recessive disorder called <span class="italic">Gillespie syndrome</span> (phenotype OMIM number 206700) also produces partial aniridia, as well as cerebellar ataxia, &#173;mental deficiency, and congenital cataracts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aniridia (often with cataract and glaucoma) can also occur sporadically in association with Wilms tumor, other genitourinary anomalies, and cognitive disability, the so-&#173;called <span class="italic">WAGR syndrome.</span> This complex of findings is called a <span class="italic">contiguous gene-&#173;deletion syndrome</span> &#173;because it results from a deletion involving nearby genes.

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Long arm 13 deletion (13q14) syndrome: retinoblastoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Retinoblastoma is one of several heritable childhood malignancies. Ocular tumors, which are usually noted before the age of 4&#160;years, affect between 1&#160;in 15,000 and 1&#160;in 34,000 live births in the United States. The disease exhibits both hereditary occurrence (approximately 30%–40%), in which tumors tend to be bilateral and multicentric, and sporadic occurrence, in which unilateral and solitary tumors are the rule. Only about 10% of patients with hereditary retinoblastoma have a &#173;family history of the disease; the remaining 90% have a new mutation in their germ cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retinoblastoma does not develop in approximately 10% of all obligate carriers of a germline mutation (ie, incomplete penetrance). In addition, a karyotypically vis&#173;i&#173;ble deletion of part&#160;of the long arm of chromosome 13 occurs in 3%–7% of all cases of retinoblastoma. The larger this deletion is, the more severe is the phenotypic syndrome, which includes cognitive disabilities and developmental delays, microcephaly, hand and foot anomalies, and ambiguous genitalia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although the hereditary pattern in familial retinoblastoma is that of an autosomal dominant mutation, the defect is recessive at the cellular level. The predisposition to retinoblastoma is caused by hemizygosity of the retinoblastoma gene <span class="italic">(RB1)</span> within band 13q14. <span class="italic">RB1</span> is a member of a class of genes called <span class="italic">recessive tumor suppressor genes.</span> The RB protein regulates the cell cycle at the G<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">1</span> checkpoint. The alleles normally pre&#173;sent at &#173;these loci help prevent tumor formation. At least 1 active normal allele is needed to prevent the cell from losing control of proliferation. Patients who inherit a defective allele from 1 parent are at greater risk for losing the other allele through a number of mechanisms. Thus, tumor formation in retinoblastoma is due to the loss of function of both normal alleles. Homozygous deletions within the 13q14 band have been noted in retinoblastomas derived from enucleated eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The first step in tumorigenesis in retinoblastoma is a recessive mutation of 1 of the homologous alleles at the retinoblastoma locus by inheritance, germinal mutation, or somatic mutation. Hereditary retinoblastomas arise from a single additional somatic event in a cell that carries an inherited mutation, whereas sporadic cases require 2 somatic events. In approximately 50% of tumors, homozygosity for such a recessive mutation results from the mitotic loss of a portion of chromosome 13, including the 13q14 band. The 2 resulting mutant alleles at this locus allow the genesis of the tumor. Retinoblastoma, therefore, seemingly represents a malignancy caused by defective gene regulation rather than by the presence of a dominant mutant oncogene. &#173;Those who inherit a mutant allele at this locus have a high incidence of nonocular second tumors thought to be caused by the same mutation. Almost half of &#173;these tumors are osteosarcomas.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Study of the occurrence of unilateral and bilateral retinoblastoma led to the <span class="italic">2-&#173;hit hypothesis,</span> according to which some tumors arise from a single cell with de novo mutations in both copies of a key gene (<span class="italic">RB1</span> in retinoblastoma or other oncogenes in other diseases). Conversely, in an individual who has a germline mutation (first “hit”) in &#173;every cell of their body, a second mutation (“hit”) occurring spontaneously in a somatic cell(s) can result in single or multiple tumors (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-7</span>). Knudson’s hypothesis, now proven, is applicable to many cancers.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">RB1</span> mutations occurring in a cone precursor cell result in retinoblastoma. In other cell lines, additional mutations in other genes (sometimes precipitated by radiation from radiotherapy or computed tomography [CT] scans) can lead to the development of other tumors, such as osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and malignant melanoma. A cascade of mutations in other genes can also lead to increasing malignancy of a tumor.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, a germline mutation may be inherited from &#173;either parent. Alternatively, a child may inherit a germline mutation from an unaffected parent who has mutations in the cells producing eggs or, more often, in sperm. The risk of mutations in sperm increases with increasing age of the &#173;father. Guidelines for clinical screening and DNA testing of &#173;children at risk for retinoblastoma have recently been revised.</p>

			<p class="h3">Ge&#173;ne&#173;tics of the phakomatoses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As mentioned, Knudson’s 2-&#173;hit hypothesis is applicable to many tumors, including the phakomatoses. The phakomatoses are a group of hereditary disorders characterized by hamartomas of the skin, eye, CNS, and viscera. Three disorders have traditionally been designated as phakomatoses: NF1 and NF2, von Hippel–&#173;Lindau syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">NF1 (von Recklinghausen disease) occurs with a germline mutation in the <span class="italic">NF1</span> gene, which produces neurofibromin. A second “hit,” or mutation, can result in the development of neurofibromas in nerves, gliomas in the optic nerve, Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas), caf<span class="accent">é</span>-&#173;au-&#173;lait spots in the skin, and other tumors. Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic studies of isolated gliomas have found that &#173;these can arise from 2 hits in the <span class="italic">NF1</span> gene.</p>
			<p class="body-text">NF2 occurs with mutations in the <span class="italic">NF2</span> gene, which produces merlin (also called <span class="italic">schwannomin</span>). A second hit can result in acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, gliomas, ependymomas, and schwannomas.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Von Hippel–&#173;Lindau syndrome (also called <span class="italic">familial cerebello ret&#173;i&#173;nal angiomatosis)</span> occurs with germline mutations in the <span class="italic">VHL</span> tumor suppressor gene. Hypoxia inducible &#173;factor, a regulator of cell division and angiogenesis, is a target of the VHL protein. The syndrome is characterized by benign and malignant multisystem tumors, including ret&#173;i&#173;nal and CNS hemangioblastomas, clear cell renal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, epidydimal cystadenoma, and pancreatic carcinoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tuberous sclerosis is caused by mutation in &#173;either of 2 genes: <span class="italic">TSC1,</span> which produces the protein hamartin, and <span class="italic">TSC2,</span> which produces the protein tuberin. Each of &#173;these account for 50% of cases. The 2 proteins interact, forming a heterodimer in the cytoplasm. Tuberous sclerosis has many clinical features, including optic nerve or ret&#173;i&#173;nal tumors (astrocytic hamartoma), which may be flat or mulberry-&#173;like in appearance; ce&#173;re&#173;bral tubers; ash-&#173;leaf skin lesions; subungual fibromas; and facial angiofibromas. In &#173;children, facial angiofibromas are thought to arise from second hits caused by exposure to UV radiation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All of &#173;these ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorders can be inherited (with affected persons usually having multiple tumors) or sporadic (with affected persons having isolated tumors). The latter may occur from 2 hits in a somatic cell. One phakomatosis that is not inherited (possibly &#173;because germline mutations are not compatible with life) is Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome (SWS; also called <span class="italic">encephalofacial angiomatosis</span>). SWS is caused by a somatic mutation in the <span class="italic">GNAQ</span> gene, which functions to control the development of blood vessels. SWS is characterized by vascular lesions that affect the skin; when the skin lesion is around the eyelids, &#173;there can also be vascular lesions of the choroid (hemangioma) and, in many cases, glaucoma. Glaucoma occurs &#173;either from trabeculodysgenesis or elevated episcleral venous pressure.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most ge&#173;ne&#173;tic diseases occur without regard for the affected individual’s racial or ethnic background. Some, however, are concentrated in certain population groups and may reflect a previous advantage of the mutation (particularly in the carrier state). For example, sickle cell carriers are more resistant to malaria and the disease is common in African-&#173;derived populations.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Tay-&#173;Sachs disease</span> (GM<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span> gangliosidosis type I), with its characteristic macular cherry-&#173;red spot, occurs predominantly in persons of Eastern Eu&#173;ro&#173;pean Jewish (Ashkenazic) ancestry. An estimated rate of 1&#160;in 30 for carriers of this disorder in the Jewish population of New York City compares with an estimated carrier rate of 1&#160;in 300&#160;in non-&#173;Jewish Americans. Familial dysautonomia <span class="italic">(Riley-&#173;Day syndrome</span>)—&#173;characterized by alacrima, corneal hypoesthesia, exodeviation, and methacholine-&#173;induced miosis—&#173;also occurs more frequently in persons of Ashkenazic ancestry, as do <span class="italic">MAK (male germ cell–&#173;associated kinase)</span>-&#173;<span class="italic">associated RP, Gaucher disease,</span> and <span class="italic">Niemann-&#173;Pick disease.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Several types of <span class="italic">achromatopsia</span> (complete color blindness) with <span class="italic">myopia</span> are common on the South Pacific island of Pingelap, affecting 5% of the Pingelapese population in the Caroline Islands of Micronesia. <span class="italic">Oguchi disease</span> is observed primarily, though not exclusively, in Japa&#173;nese &#173;people. Similarly, <span class="italic">sickle cell hemoglobinopathies</span> are inherited largely among African Americans.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In classical &#173;human ge&#173;ne&#173;tics, females with a gene for a recessive disease or trait on only 1 X chromosome should have no manifestations of the defect. However, ophthalmic examples of structural and functional abnormalities in females heterozygous for supposedly recessive X-linked traits abound.

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;6-8</span> and <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;6-7</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Detection of &#173;these carrier states of the X-linked traits is clinically relevant, especially for &#173;sisters and maternal aunts of affected males. In 1961, ge&#173;ne&#173;ticist Mary Lyon advanced an explanation for the unanticipated or partial expression of a trait by a heterozygous female. Briefly, in <span class="italic">lyonization</span> (X-chromosome inactivation), &#173;every somatic cell of a female has only 1 X chromosome that is actively functioning. The second X chromosome is inactive and forms a densely staining marginal nuclear structure demonstrated as a Barr body in a buccal smear or in “drumsticks,” pedunculated lobules of the nucleus identified in about 5% of the leukocytes of the unaffected female. X-chromosome inactivation occurs randomly to 1 X chromosome in early embryogenesis. The same X chromosome &#173;will be irreversibly inactive in &#173;every &#173;daughter of each of &#173;these “committed” primordial cells. The active gene is dominant at a cellular level. Thus, a heterozygous female for an X-linked disease &#173;will have 2 clonal cell populations (mosaic phenotype), 1 with normal activity for the gene in question and the other with mutant activity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The proportion of mutant to normal X chromosomes inactivated usually follows a normal distribution, &#173;because presumably the inactivation in vari&#173;ous cells is a random event. Thus, an average of 50% of paternal X chromosomes and 50% of maternal X chromosomes are inactivated. It is conceivable, however, that in some cases the mutant X is active in almost all cells; in other cases, the mutant X is inactivated in nearly all cells. By this mechanism, a female may express an X-linked disorder; and rare cases are known of &#173;women who have a classic color deficiency or X-linked ocular albinism, X-linked RP, or choroideremia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Carriers of X-linked ocular albinism may have a mottled mosaic fundus: in the pigmented ret&#173;i&#173;nal epithelial cells, the normal X chromosome is active; in the nonpigmented cells, the mutant X is active. However, &#173;these distinguishing features of the carrier state are not always pre&#173;sent. The possibility that the patient is a carrier cannot be entirely eliminated if a given sign is not pre&#173;sent &#173;because in a female, chance inactivation of the mutant X chromosome may have occurred in most of her primordial cells, which evolved into the specific tissue observed and may appear phenotypically normal. This subtlety is even more impor&#173;tant in the evaluation of &#173;family members with X-linked disease if the&#160;phenotypic carrier state is age dependent; thus, even in obligate carrier females for Lowe syndrome, lenticular cortical opacities are not necessarily pre&#173;sent before the third de&#173;cade of life.</p>

			<p class="h1">Complex Genetic Disease: Polygenic and Multifactorial Inheritance</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top11">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In chromosomal and mendelian (single-&#173;gene) disorders, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic analy&#173;sis of phenotypic, biochemical, or molecular par&#173;ameters is imperative. However, a &#173;simple mode of inheritance cannot be assigned and a recurrence risk cannot be predicted for many common, normal characteristics or disorders for which ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variability clearly exists. Such traits as stature, refractive error, intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness, and iris color are usually distributed as a continuous variation over a wide range without sharp distinction between normal and abnormal phenotypes. This normal distribution contrasts with the bimodal curve (or trimodal curve in codominant models) noted for conditions transmitted by a single gene. Such conditions are often termed <span class="italic">polygenic,</span> implying that they result from the operation of multiple collaborating genes, each with rather minor additive effects. Many of &#173;these common genes with small effect have been identified through GWAS. With the exception of AMD, the discovered genes account for only a small percentage of the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic effect for the traits and diseases investigated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The term <span class="italic">multifactorial inheritance</span> denotes a combination of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic and environmental &#173;factors in the etiology of disease without specifying the nature of the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic influence. Examples of disorders involving &#173;these &#173;factors in &#173;humans include refractive error, glaucoma, and AMD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Counseling for recurrence may be difficult in this type of inheritance. Ideally, empirical data are summarized from exhaustive analyses of similarly affected families in the population. In general, the risk is intermediate between population risk and mendelian risk. For example, the population risk for primary open-&#173;angle glaucoma (POAG) is 2%–3%, whereas the risk for glaucoma in families with severe myocilin mutations is near 50%. The risk for first-&#173;degree relatives of POAG patients is approximately 20%. The more severe the abnormality in the index case, the higher the risk of recurrence of the trait in relatives, presumably &#173;because &#173;either a greater number of deleterious genes are at work or a fixed population of more harmful genes exists. The risk of recurrence in &#173;future &#173;children is increased when more than one member of a &#173;family is affected, which is not true for mendelian disorders. Such observations have been offered for vari&#173;ous forms of strabismus, glaucoma, and significant refractive errors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fi&#173;nally, if the malformation or disorder has occurred in both paternal and maternal relatives, the recurrence risk is distinctly higher &#173;because of the sharing of multiple unspecifiable but potentially harmful genes in their offspring.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Pharmacogenetics</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top12">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The study of heritable &#173;factors that determine how drugs are chemically metabolized in the body is called <span class="italic">pharmacoge&#173;ne&#173;tics.</span> This field addresses ge&#173;ne&#173;tic differences among population segments that are responsible for variations in both the therapeutic and adverse effects of drugs. Investigations in pharmacoge&#173;ne&#173;tics are impor&#173;tant not only &#173;because they may lead to more rational approaches to therapy, but also &#173;because they facilitate a deeper understanding of drug pharmacology. For further discussion, see <span class="xref-local">Part&#160;V, Ocular Pharmacology</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The drug isoniazid provides an example of how pharmacoge&#173;ne&#173;tics works. This antituberculosis drug is normally inactivated by the liver enzyme acetyltransferase. A large segment of the population, which varies by geographic distribution, has a reduced amount of this enzyme; &#173;these individuals are termed <span class="italic">slow inactivators.</span> When they take isoniazid, the drug reaches higher-&#173;than-&#173;normal concentrations, causing a greater incidence of adverse effects. &#173;Family studies have shown that a reduced level of acetyltransferase is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several other well-&#173;documented examples demonstrate how pharmacoge&#173;ne&#173;tics works. One example involves 10% of the male African American population, a high percentage of male Sephardic Jews (originally from around the Mediterranean Sea), and males from a number of other ethnic groups. An&#160;X-linked recessive trait &#173;causes a deficiency in the enzyme glucose-6-&#173;phosphate dehydrogenase in the erythrocytes of affected males. As a consequence, a number of drugs (including sulfacetamide, vitamin K, acetylsalicylic acid, quinine, chloroquine, dapsone, and probenecid) may produce acute hemolytic anemia in &#173;these individuals. Pharmacoge&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;causes have also been ascribed to variations in response to ophthalmic drugs, such as the increased IOP noted in a segment of the population &#173;after prolonged use of topical corticosteroids.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several drugs have been shown to cause greater reaction in &#173;children with Down syndrome than in &#173;children without the syndrome. As a result of hypersensitivity, some &#173;children with Down syndrome have died &#173;after systemic administration of atropine. This hypersensitivity is also found with topical use of atropine in some of &#173;these &#173;children. In &#173;these patients, atropine exerts a greater-&#173;than-&#173;normal effect on pupillary dilation. In several &#173;children with Down syndrome being treated for strabismus, hyperactivity occurred several hours &#173;after local instillation of echothiophate iodide, 0.125%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">One of the earliest examples of an inherited deficit in drug metabolism involved succinylcholine, a strong muscle relaxant that interferes with acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that catabolizes acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions. Normally, succinylcholine is rapidly destroyed by plasma cholinesterase (sometimes called <span class="italic">pseudocholinesterase</span>), so that its effect is short-&#173;lived—&#173;usually no more than a few minutes. Some individuals are homozygous for a recessive gene that codes for a form of cholinesterase with a considerably lower substrate affinity. Consequently, at therapeutic doses of succinylcholine, almost no destruction occurs, and the drug continues to exert its inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase, resulting in prolonged periods of apnea.</p>

			<div id="Chapt6_Top13">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disease may not be curable, but in most cases the patient benefits considerably from appropriate medical management by the physician. Such care should include all of the following steps.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Accurate Diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Unfortunately, &#173;because health care prac&#173;ti&#173;tion&#173;ers may not be as knowledgeable about ge&#173;ne&#173;tic diagnoses as they are about other areas of medicine, many cases are not precisely diagnosed or, worse, are diagnosed incorrectly. A patient with deafness and pigmentary retinopathy may receive a diagnosis of rubella syndrome when the correct diagnosis is Usher syndrome. This latter syndrome, associated with RP, may not be recognized in patients with RP. In patients with RP and congenital polydactyly (surgically corrected in infancy), Bardet-&#173;Biedl syndrome may not be recognized. The correct diagnosis in such cases is impor&#173;tant to ensure that the patient’s educational and lifetime support needs are truly met.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-28">Complete Explanation of the Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients are often very anxious when they do not understand the nature of their disease. Carefully explaining the disorder, as currently understood, &#173;will often dispel myths patients may have about their disease and their symptoms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Virtually all ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorders confer burdens that may interfere with certain activities &#173;later in life. The appropriate time to discuss &#173;these burdens with patients and &#173;family members is often when they first ask about the consequences of a disease. Such explanations need to be tempered with empathy and an understanding of the pos&#173;si&#173;ble emotional and psychological effects of this information.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Treatment of the Disease Pro&#173;cess</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Definitive cures—&#173;that is, reversing or correcting under&#173;lying ge&#173;ne&#173;tic defects—&#173;are yet to emerge for most heritable disorders. However, some conditions in which metabolic defects have been identified can often be managed through 5 fundamental approaches:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-13">1.&#9;dietary control</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;chelation of excessive metabolites</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;enzyme or gene-&#173;product replacements</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">4.&#9;vitamin and cofactor therapy</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">5.&#9;drug therapy to reduce accumulation of harmful products</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Dietary control</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorders affecting the eye that arise from an inborn error of metabolism can be managed effectively through dietary therapy. &#173;These conditions include homocystinuria, Refsum disease, gyrate atrophy, galactokinase deficiency, and galactosemia. Implementing a galactose-&#173;free diet can reverse some of the main clinical signs of galactosemia (eg, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and weight loss). Progression of cortical cataracts can be avoided, and less extensive lens opacities may even regress with a galactose-&#173;free diet. With time, patients with galactosemia are able to metabolize galactose through alternative pathways, obviating the need for lifelong dietary restriction.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Chelation of excessive metabolites</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Disorders that result from enzyme or transport protein deficiencies may lead to the accumulation of a metabolite or metal that harms vari&#173;ous tissues. For example, in Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration), decreased levels of serum ceruloplasmin result in poor transport of &#173;free copper (Cu<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>) ions and in storage of copper in such tissues as the brain, liver, and cornea. Resultant clinical signs can be reversed, at least partially, &#173;after the administration of <span class="smallcaps_CAPS">D</span>-penicillamine, a chelator of Cu<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>. Other copper chelators, such as British anti-Lewisite (BAL), can be used, along with a copper-&#173;deficient diet, to reverse the clinical signs of Wilson disease.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Enzyme replacement therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Enzyme replacement therapy via plasma infusions in patients with Fabry disease has succeeded in temporarily decreasing plasma levels of the accumulated substrate ceramide trihexoside. The drugs are expensive (current costs at approximately $250,000 per year), presenting a barrier to successful treatment for many patients around the world. Enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease is not a cure, but it improves metabolism, curbs disease progression, and potentially reverses some symptoms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Organ transplantation can be considered a form of regionalized enzyme replacement. In patients with cystinosis, cystine crystals accumulate in the kidneys. When a normal kidney, with its rich source of enzymes, is transplanted into a patient with cystinosis, cystine does not accumulate in the cells of the renal tubules and renal function tends to remain normal. In a complementary approach, stem cell transplantation is being investigated to treat vari&#173;ous diseases, including &#173;those of the eye.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-16">Vitamin therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vitamin therapy appears to be of benefit in 2 autosomal recessive disorders. In at least some patients with homocystinuria, vitamin B<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span> (pyridoxine) administration has decreased homocystine accumulation in plasma and reduced the severity of the disorder. Vitamin A and vitamin E therapy have been noted to benefit some patients with neurologic impairment due to abetalipoproteinemia; such therapy is also likely to slow or lessen the development and progression of ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration. More long-&#173;term therapeutic &#173;trials are necessary to better define the efficacy of vitamin therapy for &#173;these and perhaps other metabolic disorders.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Drug therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vari&#173;ous genet&#173;ically determined disorders can be managed by use of an appropriate drug. For example, excess accumulation of uric acid in primary gout can be prevented or reduced &#173;either by blocking the activity of the enzyme xanthine oxidase with the drug allopurinol or by increasing excretion of uric acid by the kidneys with the use of probenecid. In familial hypercholesterolemia, the elevated serum cholesterol levels can often be reduced through the use of vari&#173;ous cholesterol-&#173;lowering drugs or substances that bind bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Appropriate management of sequelae and complications</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some of the sequelae of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic diseases, such as glaucoma in Axenfeld-&#173;Rieger syndrome or cataracts in RP, can be managed successfully to preserve or partially restore vision. However, patients need to understand how treatment of the sequelae or complications may differ according to their individual situations.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Gene therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although only a few clinical &#173;trials for a &#173;limited number of genes are &#173;under way, viral-&#173;mediated gene replacement for inherited ret&#173;i&#173;nal diseases is available (see voretigene neparvovec in Chapter&#160;5). The ophthalmologist is obliged &#173;either to carefully search the online clinical &#173;trials databases and the published lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture for treatment &#173;trials that the patient may qualify for; or refer the patient to another professional who &#173;will conduct such a search for treatment &#173;trials for which the patient may qualify.

				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-11"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Accurate diagnosis:</span> To derive an accurate and specific diagnosis, the physician must be sufficiently aware of the range of &#173;human ocular pathology.<ul><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">It is impossible to counsel or refer patients on the basis of “congenital nystagmus” or “color blindness” or “macular degeneration”; &#173;these are signs, not diagnoses.</li></ul></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Complete &#173;family history:</span> A &#173;family history &#173;will narrow the choices of pos&#173;si&#173;ble inheritance patterns, but it may not necessarily exclude new mutational events, isolated occurrences of recessive diseases, and chromosomal rearrangements in individual circumstances.<ul><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">The ophthalmologist should examine (or arrange to have examined) the parents, siblings, and other &#173;family members for mild manifestations of dominant diseases or characteristic carrier states in X-linked disorders.</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">Only an ophthalmologist &#173;will be cognizant of, and attentive to, the aty&#173;pi&#173;cal findings of hereditary ocular disorders. For example, identification of 1 young adult with the findings of Usher syndrome—&#173;prelingual deafness; night blindness; visual field constriction; and, ultimately, deterioration of central vision—&#173;obligates the ophthalmologist to evaluate a younger sibling who is congenitally deaf but “historically” has no eye prob&#173;lems. The probability is very high that the sibling has the same disease.</li></ul></li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Understanding of the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic and clinical aspects of the disorder:</span> The ophthalmologist should appreciate, perhaps more intimately than any other physician, how some clinically similar diseases inherited in the same pattern may be the result of dif&#173;fer&#173;ent and even nonallelic defects. For example, the visual implications of, and prognoses for, tyrosinase-&#173;positive and tyrosinase-&#173;negative oculocutaneous albinism are considerably dif&#173;fer&#173;ent.<ul><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">Ocular albinism is an X-&#173;linked trait and very rare in females.</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">Some entities that are clinically similar may be inherited differently and thus have a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent impact on vari&#173;ous &#173;family members.</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">In another example, pseudoxanthoma elasticum in both its autosomal dominant and recessive modes is often a late-&#173;onset disease that has serious implications for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Informed counseling falls short if the ophthalmologist advises an affected patient only about visual disability associated with angioid streaks without attention to the complete disease and the risks to other &#173;family members.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Issues in Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic Counseling</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is impor&#173;tant to remember that an individual affected by a heritable condition may have a homozygous recessive trait. Thus, the ophthalmologist should search for parental consanguinity or ambiguous parentage (nonpaternity, incest, occult adoption) or for a new mutation and should inquire about advanced paternal (or maternal grandparental) age. Heterogeneity may complicate the diagnosis. Somatic mutations also occur, as with segmental neurofibromatosis or unilateral unifocal retinoblastoma. Nonpenetrance or mild expressivity in other &#173;family members should be excluded through diligent examination. Chromosomal abnormalities and phenocopies caused by infections or drugs may account for the isolated affected person. Nonetheless, the ophthalmologist’s obligation to explain the disorder begins with an accurate diagnosis and establishment of the mode of heritability.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counseling pro&#173;cess is nondirective; the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counselor informs rather than advises. It is inappropriate, perhaps even unethical, for a counselor to tell the patient what to do (eg, not to have any &#173;children). Counselors recognize the ability of individuals and families to make appropriate decisions for themselves concerning their own health and reproductive choices in accordance with their personal beliefs and opinions, and they support them in the decision-&#173;making pro&#173;cess.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some instances, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing for ocular disorders may provide individuals with information about their specific ge&#173;ne&#173;tic mutation. While such testing can assist in the diagnosis and potentially give patients options&#160;to participate in clinical &#173;trials of new treatments, it may also identify carrier status and mutations in asymptomatic individuals who have known familial mutations, facilitating early diagnosis and subsequent intervention when available. The implications of &#173;these results require careful consideration and counseling, &#173;because the information can affect not just the individuals who underwent testing but other &#173;family members as well. Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing requests need to be carefully evaluated for compliance with existing guidelines and position statements covering the related ethical issues. For example, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing for an adult-&#173;onset condition in a child, on the parents’ request when &#173;there is no immediate medical benefit for the child, is not indicated.</p>
			<p class="h2">Reproductive Issues</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">With a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic diagnosis, the counseling ophthalmologist should outline the options&#160;available for &#173;family planning. Some &#173;people may accept a high statistical risk and choose to have &#173;children. This decision is based on how they perceive the social and psychological challenges of the disorder. Attitude &#173;toward reproduction may be considerably dif&#173;fer&#173;ent, for instance, for a female carrier of protanopia than for a female carrier of X-linked RP or choroideremia, even though the statistical risk for an affected son is the same for each carrier. Some may elect to delay childbearing in the hope of &#173;future medical advances. For a variety of personal and ethical considerations, &#173;others may opt for contraception, termination of pregnancy, sterilization, and/or adoption.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Artificial insemination by a donor is a useful option&#160;in &#173;family planning if the &#173;father has a dominant disease or if both parents are carriers of a biochemically detectable recessive disorder. However, it is clearly not applicable if the &#173;mother is the carrier of an X-linked or mitochondrial disorder or if the &#173;mother is the individual affected by an autosomal dominant mutation. Fi&#173;nally, donor eggs, donor embryos, and surrogate motherhood—&#173;where &#173;these options&#160;are available—&#173;may be alternatives for some families.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some circumstances, an individual or a couple may use the results of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing and consider prenatal testing or in vitro fertilization (IVF) technology with preimplantation ge&#173;ne&#173;tic diagnosis (PGD) to avoid recurrence in their &#173;children. Knowledge of &#173;these options&#160;and of the potential ethical, social, and cultural issues they raise is impor&#173;tant for clinicians.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-30">Prenatal diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prenatal diagnosis (PND) with amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) for biochemically identifiable disorders (eg, Tay-&#173;Sachs disease, many mucopolysaccharidoses, and more than 100 other diseases) is useful in the proper ge&#173;ne&#173;tic scenarios.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other pos&#173;si&#173;ble indications for PND include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-31">advanced maternal age or positive results from prenatal screening, which both carry an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">elevated maternal serum <span class="bullet-list_greek--tx-"></span>-fetoprotein, suggesting a neural tube defect</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">presence of soft markers or fetal abnormalities that could suggest a chromosomal abnormality or a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disease</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-32">presence of a familial disease detectable by DNA analy&#173;sis</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–16 weeks of gestation, when enough fluid and cells can be obtained for culture and the maternal risk of abortion is relatively low. The risk of spontaneous abortion or fetal morbidity from the procedure is approximately 0.5%. &#173;Earlier PND of chromosomal abnormalities, at about 10 weeks of gestation, is available through the use of CVS. In this procedure, tissue from the placenta is obtained &#173;under ultrasound visualization. It is then cultured and karyotyped in a manner similar to that used for amniocentesis. As a first-&#173;trimester procedure, CVS allows &#173;earlier diagnosis and can lead to &#173;earlier and thus safer pregnancy termination. The rate of spontaneous abortion associated with this procedure is estimated at 1%–2%.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cell-&#173;free fetal DNA (cffDNA), sometimes called <span class="italic">noninvasive prenatal screening,</span> is a new technique to examine fetal DNA in the maternal bloodstream. CffDNA is being developed to allow PND without the risks associated with CVS or amniocentesis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Couples who elect PND in the form of &#173;either CVS or amniocentesis may face considerable anxiety about complications, such as pregnancy loss, waiting time to obtain the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic results, and, potentially, the difficult decision of &#173;whether to terminate an affected pregnancy—&#173;a dilemma that &#173;couples are aware they may face repeatedly with each consecutive pregnancy.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-30">Preimplantation ge&#173;ne&#173;tic diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Preimplantation ge&#173;ne&#173;tic diagnosis (PGD) has the advantage of enabling se&#173;lection of unaffected embryos through testing prior to implantation. Embryos are created using <span class="italic">intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI),</span> in which a single sperm is injected into each egg in an attempt to achieve fertilization. On day 3, when each embryo consists of 6–8&#160;cells, 1 cell (blastomere) is removed per embryo. DNA is extracted from &#173;these cells and amplified using fluo&#173;rescent polymerase chain reaction (F-PCR) to make millions of copies of the relevant region of DNA. This region is then sequenced to provide a reliable diagnosis of the status of the ge&#173;ne&#173;tic mutation in each embryo. Unaffected embryos are transferred to the uterus on day 4 or 5. Usually, no more than 1 or 2 embryos can be transferred, to avoid the possibility of multiple births.</p>
			<p class="body-text">PGD is acceptable to many &#173;couples and, for some, it represents a valuable alternative to PND. For some &#173;couples with a moral or religious objection to pregnancy termination and who are at risk of having a child with a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic condition, this technique may provide the opportunity to have an unaffected child. However, PGD may be associated with stress and anxiety for &#173;couples similar to that discussed &#173;earlier. Other concerns include the high cost of IVF and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing (often not covered by insurance) and the low IVF pregnancy rates. PGD has raised ethical issues about embryo destruction and sex se&#173;lection. Furthermore, the issue of eugenics (se&#173;lection for perceived favorable nonmedical traits) has also been debated. Just as diseases differ among individuals, so do the concerns and beliefs of dif&#173;fer&#173;ent parents; thus, the acceptability of dif&#173;fer&#173;ent reproductive technologies should be discussed with each &#173;couple.</p>
			<p class="h2">Referral to Providers of Support for Persons With Disabilities</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Individuals and families often receive considerable benefit from referral to local, regional, or national agencies, support groups, or foundations that provide ser&#173;vices for &#173;those with a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar disease. &#173;These organ&#173;izations include local and state agencies for the blind or visually impaired, special school education programs, and appropriate consumer groups. Particularly when a disability is chronic and progressive, &#173;these agencies or support groups can greatly aid the individual or &#173;family in adjusting to changing visual disabilities. They also allow individuals or families with a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorder to meet &#173;others with the same condition, providing them with support and pos&#173;si&#173;ble advice.</p>

			<p class="h2">Recommendations for Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic Testing of Inherited Eye Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The AAO Task Force on Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic Testing has stated that when properly performed, interpreted, and acted upon, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic tests can improve the accuracy of diagnosis, prognosis, and ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counseling; can lead to reduced risk of disease recurrence in families at risk; and can facilitate the delivery of personalized care. Like other forms of medical intervention, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing carries specific risks that vary from patient to patient and from &#173;family to &#173;family. The results of a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic test may affect plans to have &#173;children, create guilt or anxiety, and complicate &#173;family relationships. For &#173;these reasons, skilled counseling should be provided to all individuals who undergo ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing in order to maximize benefits and minimize risks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The task force’s 7 recommendations are as follows:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;Offer ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing to patients with clinical findings suggestive of a mendelian disorder whose causative gene(s) have been identified. If unfamiliar with such testing, refer the patient to a physician or counselor who is familiar with it. In all cases, ensure that the patient receives counseling from a physician with expertise in inherited disease or a certified ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counselor.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;Use Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–&#173;approved laboratories for all clinical testing. When pos&#173;si&#173;ble, use laboratories that include in their reports estimates of the pathogenicity of observed ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variants that are based on a review of the medical lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture and databases of disease-&#173;causing and non-disease-&#173;causing variants.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;Provide a copy of each ge&#173;ne&#173;tic test report to the patient so that she or he can in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dently seek mechanism-&#173;specific information, such as the availability of gene-&#173;specific clinical &#173;trials, should the patient wish to do so.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">4.&#9;Avoid direct-&#173;to-&#173;consumer ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing and discourage patients from obtaining such tests themselves. Encourage the involvement of a trained physician, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counselor, or both for all ge&#173;ne&#173;tic tests so that appropriate interpretation and counseling can be provided.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">5.&#9;Avoid unnecessary parallel testing; order the most specific test(s) available, given the patient’s clinical findings. Restrict massively parallel strategies like whole-&#173;exome sequencing and whole-&#173;genome sequencing to research studies conducted at tertiary care facilities.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">6.&#9;Avoid routine ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing for genet&#173;ically complex disorders like age-&#173;related macular degeneration and late-&#173;onset primary open-&#173;angle glaucoma &#173;until specific treatment or surveillance strategies have been shown in one or more published prospective clinical &#173;trials to be of benefit to individuals with specific disease-&#173;associated genotypes. In the meantime, confine the genotyping of such patients to research studies.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">7.&#9;Avoid testing asymptomatic minors with untreatable disorders except in extraordinary circumstances. For the few cases in which such testing is believed to be warranted, the following steps should be taken before the test is performed: (a)&#160;the parents and child should undergo formal ge&#173;ne&#173;tic counseling; (b) the certified counselor or physician performing the counseling should state his or her opinion in writing that the test is in the &#173;family’s best interest; and (c) all parents with custodial responsibility for the child should agree in writing with the decision to perform the test.</p>
