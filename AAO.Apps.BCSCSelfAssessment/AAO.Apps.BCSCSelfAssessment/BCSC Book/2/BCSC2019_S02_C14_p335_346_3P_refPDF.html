			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Overview</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Under physiologic conditions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) participate in normal biochemical pro&#173;cesses, where they &#173;either act as intermediaries or function as second messengers. Also, ROS can be generated by exogenous influences, such as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light or cigarette smoking. Oxidative stress occurs when the production of ROS exceeds their degradation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Unchecked, ROS injure cell membranes and DNA, leading to tissue damage and cell death. ROS, like &#173;free radicals, react with unsaturated fatty acids that are pre&#173;sent within cells and cell membranes, forming lipid peroxides. The oxidation of membrane phospholipids has been hypothesized to increase the permeability of cell membranes and/or inhibit membrane ion pumps. This loss of barrier function is thought to lead to edema, disturbances in electrolyte balance, and elevation of intracellular calcium levels, all of which contribute to cell malfunction and, potentially, to cell death. &#173;Free radical–&#173;mediated DNA damage can also lead to cell death through induction of apoptosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The resultant loss of cells leads to dysfunction in the eye, &#173;whether at the level of the trabecular meshwork and ret&#173;i&#173;nal ganglion cells (RGCs) in glaucoma, the inner ret&#173;ina in diabetic retinopathy, or the outer ret&#173;ina in age-&#173;related macular degeneration (AMD).</p>

			<p class="h1">Reactive Oxygen Species</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Sources of Reactive Oxygen Species</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Reactive oxygen species are generated from metabolic pro&#173;cesses, inflammatory responses, and exposure to UV light. ROS include hydrogen peroxide (H<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>O<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>) and singlet oxygen (<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>O<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>), as well as lipid peroxides and reactive carbohydrates such as ketoamine and ketoaldehyde groups. &#173;Free radicals, another group of ROS, possess an unpaired electron that makes them highly reactive &#173;toward other molecular species.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Exogenous sources of ROS include UV light and tobacco smoke. Endogenous sources include the <span class="italic">electron transport chain</span> in mitochondria and, as part of our innate immune response by neutrophils and macrophages, <span class="italic">respiratory burst,</span> where superoxide anion (O<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span><span class="superscript CharOverride-2">•</span><span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">−</span>) and the hydroxyl radical (OH•) form to attack pathogens (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-1</span>). The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (Nox) constitute an enzyme &#173;family that functions primarily to produce ROS and is expressed in many cells. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;14-1</span> pre&#173;sents some impor&#173;tant ROS.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Toxicity from ROS leads to cell death. ROS may directly induce DNA damage, resulting in cell death via apoptosis. Cell death can also occur through loss of the barrier function of the plasma membrane via a pro&#173;cess known as <span class="italic">lipid peroxidation.</span> Structures with a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are particularly susceptible to lipid peroxidation.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Lipid Peroxidation</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lipid peroxidation occurs via auto-&#173;oxidation and photo-&#173;oxidation. Random oxidation of lipids occurs by the pro&#173;cess of <span class="italic">auto-&#173;oxidation,</span> a &#173;free radical chain reaction usually described as a series of 3 steps:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">1. initiation</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2. propagation</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">3. termination</p>
			<p class="body-text">During the initiation step, fatty acids are converted to an intermediate radical following removal of an allylic hydrogen. The propagation step follows immediately, and the fatty acid radical intermediate reacts with oxygen at both ends to produce fatty acid peroxy radicals (ROO•); this pro&#173;cess is known as <span class="italic">lipid peroxidation.</span> Thus, a new fatty acid radical is formed, which again can react with oxygen. As long as oxygen is available, a single &#173;free radical can cause oxidation of thousands of fatty acids. A termination reaction, in which 2 radicals form a nonradical product, can interrupt the chain reaction. Auto-&#173;oxidation is also inhibited by &#173;free radical scavengers such as vitamin E, which cause termination reactions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;14-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">PUFAs are susceptible to auto-&#173;oxidation &#173;because their allylic hydrogen atoms are easily removed by several types of initiating radicals. The primary products of auto-&#173;oxidation formed during the propagation step are hydroperoxides (ROOH), which may decompose, especially in the presence of trace amounts of transition metal ions (eg, ferrous [reduced iron, Fe<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>] or cupric [reduced copper, Cu<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">1</span><span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>]), to create ROO•, OH•, and oxy radicals (RO•).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In <span class="italic">photo-&#173;oxidation</span>, by contrast, oxygen is activated by light to form <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>O<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>, which in turn reacts with unsaturated fatty acids or other cellular constituents. The most widely accepted mechanism of <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>O<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> generation involves exposure of a photosensitizer to light in the presence of normal triplet oxygen (<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>O<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>). Photo-&#173;oxidation can be inhibited by <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>O<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> quenchers such as carotenoids (see the section Carotenoids) (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;14-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lipid peroxidation &#173;causes not only direct damage to the cell membrane but also secondary damage to cells through its breakdown products. Lipid peroxides are unstable, and they break down to form many aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenals. &#173;These aldehydes can quickly react with proteins, inhibiting the proteins’ normal functions. Both the lens and the ret&#173;ina are susceptible to such oxidative damage.</p>

			<p class="h1">Reactive Oxygen Species and Defense Mechanisms</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although the eye is constantly exposed to light, it is protected from the consequences of&#160;UV-&#173;light exposure via vari&#173;ous mechanisms employed by dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ocular structures. The cornea and the lens prevent dif&#173;fer&#173;ent wavelengths of UV light from reaching the ret&#173;ina (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>, <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;10-3</span>). The high concentration of ascorbate (vitamin C) in the aqueous and vitreous acts to block UV light and participates in cellular antioxidant pathways.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cellular components are protected from ROS by antioxidant mechanisms. Cells contain enzymes that neutralize ROS and the toxic metabolites formed by the interaction between ROS and cellular components (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;14-1</span>). &#173;These enzymes include superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-&#173;Px); they are discussed &#173;later in the chapter. The transcription &#173;factor <span class="italic">nuclear &#173;factor erythroid </span><span class="italic">2–&#173;related &#173;factor 2</span> (Nrf2) regulates expression of numerous antioxidant genes and is upregulated &#173;under oxidative stress. Nrf2 is a potential therapeutic target, and induction of Nrf2 enhanced RGC survival in experimental models of oxidative stress generated by ischemia–&#173;reperfusion injury.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cell is also protected from ROS by compartmentalizing &#173;these species, preventing their contact with intracellular components. An example of this is the electron transport chain, which is contained within the walls of the mitochondria. However, some reactive species may leak out of their enzyme-&#173;binding sites or escape antioxidant enzymes, causing damage to cellular components such as proteins, membrane lipids, and DNA. In addition, any &#173;free iron (Fe<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>) pre&#173;sent may catalyze formation of OH• from superoxide and H<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>O<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;14-1</span>).</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Oxidative Damage to the Lens and Protective Mechanisms</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As stated &#173;earlier, ROS are generated by metabolic pro&#173;cesses, inflammatory responses, and exposure to UV light. The lens relies almost entirely on anaerobic metabolism and is shielded from the immune system. Thus, the major source of ROS in the lens is exposure to UV light. Although most UVB radiation (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>320-nm wavelength) striking the &#173;human eye is absorbed &#173;either by the cornea or by the ascorbate pre&#173;sent at high levels in the aqueous humor, a certain amount reaches the lens epithelium, where it can cause damage. UVA light (320–400-nm wavelength) can penetrate more deeply into the lens, where it can react with vari&#173;ous chromophores to generate H<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>O<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>, O<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span><span class="superscript CharOverride-2">•</span><span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">−</span>, and <span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>O<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although repair and regeneration mechanisms are active in the lens epithelium and superficial cortex, no such mechanisms exist in the deep cortex and the nucleus, where any damage to lens proteins and membrane lipids is irreversible. One result of this damage can be crosslinking and insolubilization of proteins, leading to loss of transparency (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10&#160;in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;11,</span> <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract</span>). The lens contains unusually high levels of protein sulfhydryl groups that must exist almost entirely in the reduced state for the tissue to remain transparent. The young, healthy lens possesses a variety of effective antioxidant systems to protect against oxidative stress. &#173;These defenses include the enzymes glutathione reductase, GSH-&#173;Px, catalase, and SOD (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;14-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Glutathione (GSH), concentrated at the lens epithelium, acts as a major scavenger of ROS in the lens. With age, levels of GSH decline significantly in the &#173;human lens, particularly in the nucleus. Studies have indicated that a cortical–&#173;nuclear barrier may exist in the mature &#173;human lens, which inhibits the &#173;free flow of GSH to the nucleus. As a result, the &#173;human lens nucleus becomes more susceptible to oxidative damage and cataract formation with age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The &#173;free radical scavengers ascorbate and vitamin E, also pre&#173;sent in the lens, work in conjunction with GSH and the GSH oxidation-&#173;reduction (redox) cycle to protect against oxidative damage (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;14-2</span>). Carotenoids that can quench <span class="superscript CharOverride-1">1</span>O<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span> also exist in the lens. Epidemiologic (observational) studies have shown that individuals with higher levels of plasma antioxidants, particularly vitamin E, have a reduced risk of cataract, &#173;especially nuclear cataract. However, 3 prospective randomized placebo-&#173;controlled clinical &#173;trials—&#173;Age-&#173;Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS); Age-&#173;Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2); and the Vitamin&#160;E, Cataract, and Age-&#173;Related Maculopathy Trial (VECAT)—&#173;found that high-&#173;dose formulations of antioxidants neither prevented the development nor slowed the progression of age-&#173;related cataracts.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Vulnerability of the Retina to Reactive Oxygen Species</p>
			<div id="Chapt14_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Experimental data have shown that ret&#173;i&#173;nal photoreceptors degenerate when exposed to oxidative challenges such as hyperbaric oxygen, iron overload, or injection of lipid peroxide into the vitreous humor. In addition, the ret&#173;ina degenerates when antioxidant defenses are reduced, which presumably increases lipid peroxidation even in the absence of unusual oxidative stress. The ret&#173;ina has several distinctive characteristics that make it vulnerable to damage from lipid peroxidation; 4 of them are considered &#173;here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-10">Vertebrate rod outer segments are susceptible to damage by oxygen &#173;because of their high levels of PUFAs. Their phospholipids contain docosahexaenoic acid, the most highly polyunsaturated fatty acid occurring in nature. It is well established that PUFAs are sensitive to peroxidation in proportion to their number of double bonds.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Rod inner segments are very rich in mitochondria. The majority of endogenous ROS are produced by the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which may leak activated oxygen species.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">The abundant oxygen supply through the choroid and the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels elevates the risk of oxidative damage. Vertebrate ret&#173;i&#173;nas maintained in vitro showed at least a sevenfold-&#173;higher rate of oxygen consumption per milligram of protein than all other tissues tested (except the adrenal gland). The oxygen tension is highest at the choroid and decreases &#173;toward the inner segments of the ret&#173;ina.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-11">&#173;There are many chromophores in the outer ret&#173;ina. Light exposure may trigger photo-&#173;oxidative pro&#173;cesses mediated by <span class="bullet-list_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>O<span class="bullet-list_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Intense light at levels that may be encountered in daily life is phototoxic to the ret&#173;ina. Even though the cornea absorbs UV radiation, the ret&#173;i&#173;nas of young &#173;people are exposed to UV light in the range of 350–400&#160;nm (young lenses transmit &#173;these wavelengths). As the lens yellows with age, it can block wavelengths of up to approximately 430&#160;nm. &#173;Because the adult lens absorbs nearly 100% of light below 400&#160;nm, &#173;little or no UV light reaches the ret&#173;ina in older &#173;people.</p>

The primary enzyme involved in GSH-&#173;mediated detoxification of peroxides is GSH-&#173;Px, which is selenium dependent. The highest concentration of selenium in the &#173;human eye is pre&#173;sent in the RPE: 100–400&#160;ng in the RPE cells of a single &#173;human eye, up to 10 times as many as in the ret&#173;ina (40&#160;ng). The selenium level in the &#173;human ret&#173;ina remains constant with age; in the &#173;human RPE, however, the level increases with age.</p>

A detailed study of the vitamin E content of microdissected parts of vertebrate eyes showed that the RPE is rich in vitamin E relative to photoreceptors and that photoreceptors are rich in vitamin&#160;E relative to most other cells in the eye. Furthermore, vitamin E levels in &#173;human ret&#173;i&#173;nal tissues increase with age &#173;until the sixth de&#173;cade of life, &#173;after which they decrease. This decrease coincides with the age at which the incidence of AMD increases in the population.</p>

			<p class="h2">Ascorbate</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In many species, ascorbate (vitamin C) is found throughout the eye in concentrations that are high relative to &#173;those in other tissues. In addition to blocking UV light in the aqueous humor, ascorbate is thought to function synergistically with vitamin E to terminate &#173;free radical reactions. Vitamin C functions as an electron donor, reducing oxidized ele&#173;ments and molecules. It has been proposed that vitamin C can react with the vitamin E radicals formed when vitamin E scavenges &#173;free radicals. Vitamin E radicals are then regenerated to form native vitamin E. The vitamin C radicals resulting from this regeneration can be reduced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) reductase, with NADH as the electron acceptor. Ascorbate is found at high levels in the aqueous humor as well as in the vitreous, where it functions to reduce oxygen levels (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span>, <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;11-6</span>).</p>

Beta carotene, the precursor of vitamin A, can act as a &#173;free radical trap at low oxygen tension. Studies of postmortem &#173;human ret&#173;i&#173;nas have shown that carotenoids make up the yellow pigment in the macula. Two carotenoids, <span class="italic">lutein</span> and <span class="italic">zeaxanthin,</span> are pre&#173;sent in the macula and located in the Henle fiber layer. In &#173;humans, zeaxanthin is concentrated primarily in the fovea, whereas lutein is dispersed throughout the ret&#173;ina. Interestingly, &#173;little beta carotene is pre&#173;sent in the &#173;human eye. Furthermore, carotenoids are pre&#173;sent only in the ret&#173;ina and are absent from the RPE. In the peripheral ret&#173;ina, lutein and zeaxanthin are concentrated in rod outer segments and may act as antioxidants to protect against short-&#173;wavelength vis&#173;i&#173;ble light. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;14-3A</span> shows the localization of antioxidants in the &#173;human macula and peripheral ret&#173;ina, and <span class="xref-figure-local">Figure&#160;14-3B</span> shows their localization in a cross section of the peripheral ret&#173;ina.</p>

			<div id="Chapt14_Top9">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases that are the leading &#173;causes of blindness, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and AMD. In many cases, the onset of oxidative damage may precede the clinical manifestation of &#173;these conditions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to their role in the diseases discussed in the following sections, oxidative mechanisms are involved in numerous diseases of the anterior and posterior segments and are central in many inherited diseases of the eye. &#173;Future research and treatment &#173;will target &#173;these mechanisms, directly and indirectly, to aid in the management of their related conditions.</p>

			<p class="h2">Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Reactive oxygen species’ involvement in glaucoma may pertain to their effect on the trabecular meshwork and RGCs. An increasing body of evidence suggests that trabecular dysfunction occurs following exposure of the trabecular meshwork to ROS. In addition, several reports have demonstrated the development of oxidative stress and cell loss when RGCs in culture are exposed to increased pressure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Population-&#173;based studies on the effect of dietary antioxidants have shown conflicting results in glaucoma, and &#173;earlier studies failed to show a benefit of &#173;these antioxidants. However, a more recent study, with longer follow-up, demonstrated that the risk of developing primary open-&#173;angle glaucoma (POAG) was 20% lower in participants who consume more foods high in antioxidants. Furthermore, in patients with POAG, a similar diet reduced the risk of development of paracentral visual field defects by 44%. The mechanism of such an effect has been suggested to involve aberrant nitric oxide pathways.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness worldwide in adults aged 20 to 64&#160;years. Several metabolic pathways, initiated by hyperglycemia and lack of insulin signaling, generate oxidative stress and are implicated in the development of diabetic retinopathy:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-13">polyol pathway</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">protein kinase C (PKC) pathway</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-11">hexosamine pathway</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) result from nonenzymatic glycation of vari&#173;ous molecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids) and exist in foods prepared at very high temperatures. AGEs interact with specific cell surface receptors, which then signal intracellular inflammatory pathways, leading to generation of ROS.</p>
			<p class="body-text">ROS can lead to long-&#173;term changes via epige&#173;ne&#173;tic modification, especially in mitochondrial DNA. This may partly explain the phenomenon of metabolic memory, wherein beneficial effects of past tight metabolic control persist for a period, reducing the progression of retinopathy, as demonstrated by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). Conversely, in patients with poor metabolic control, epige&#173;ne&#173;tic modifications may allow diabetic retinopathy to pro&#173;gress even &#173;after intensive control has been achieved. Most data supporting a role for antioxidants in diabetic retinopathy have come from cell culture or animal models. One clinical trial evaluated the role of the PKC inhibitor ruboxistaurin, which reduced vision loss and the need for macular &#173;laser therapy in comparison to controls in patients with diabetic retinopathy.</p>
