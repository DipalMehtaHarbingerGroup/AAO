			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Olfactory Nerve (First Cranial Nerve)</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The olfactory nerve (CN I) originates from small olfactory receptors in the mucous membrane of the nose. Unmyelinated CN I fibers pass from &#173;these receptors in the nasal cavity through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and enter the ventral surface of the olfactory bulb, where they form the nerve.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The olfactory tract runs posteriorly from the bulb beneath the frontal lobe of the brain in a groove (or sulcus) and lateral to the gyrus rectus (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-3</span>). The gyrus rectus forms the anterolateral border of the suprasellar cistern. Meningiomas arising from the arachnoid cells in this area can cause impor&#173;tant ophthalmic signs and symptoms associated with loss of olfaction.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Optic Nerve (Second Cranial Nerve)</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The optic nerve (CN II) consists of more than 1 million axons that originate in the ganglion cell layer of the ret&#173;ina and extend &#173;toward the lateral geniculate nucleus. The optic nerve begins anatomically at the optic nerve head (ONH) but physiologically and functionally within the ganglion cell layer that covers the entire ret&#173;ina and continues to the optic chiasm. It may be divided into the following 4 topographic areas (<span class="xref-table">Fig 3-4, &#173;Table&#160;3-1</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">intraocular region (ONH, consisting of the superficial nerve fiber layer [NFL], prelaminar area, laminar area, and retrolaminar area)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">intraorbital region (located within the muscle cone)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">intracanalicular region (located within the optic canal)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">intracranial region (ending at the optic chiasm)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The optic nerve originates directly from the diencephalon and, developmentally, is part of the brain and central ner&#173;vous system. Its fibers are surrounded not by Schwann cells but by myelin produced by oligodendrocytes. The intraorbital portion is approximately 25–30&#160;mm long, which is greater than the distance between the back of the globe and the optic canal (18&#160;mm). For this reason, when the eye is in the primary position, the optic nerve runs a sinuous course. Axial proptosis secondary to thyroid eye disease or a retrobulbar tumor &#173;will first lead to straightening of the intraorbital optic nerve. Further elongation can lead to stretching of the optic nerve, which may cause chronic nerve injury and optic neuropathy.</p>

			<p class="h2">Intraocular Region</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ONH is the principal site of many congenital and acquired ocular diseases. Its anterior surface is vis&#173;i&#173;ble ophthalmoscopically as the <span class="italic">optic disc,</span> an oval structure whose size reflects some ethnic and racial variance. The size of the ONH varies widely, averaging 1.76&#160;mm horizontally and 1.92&#160;mm vertically. The central depression, or <span class="italic">cup,</span> is located slightly temporal to the geometric center of the nerve head and represents an axon-&#173;free region. Results of studies have found that the cup maintains its size or enlarges throughout life. The main branches of the central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery (CRA) and the central ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein (CRV) pass through the center of the cup.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ONH can be divided into 4 topographic areas (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-5</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-7">superficial NFL</li>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;These are discussed in the following sections. <span class="italic">Note:</span> The term <span class="italic">optic disc</span> has been used interchangeably in the lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture to refer to the superficial NFL and the prelaminar area, or to the entire ONH.

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Superficial nerve fiber layer</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As the unmyelinated ganglion cell axons enter the nerve head, they retain their retinotopic organ&#173;ization, with fibers from the upper ret&#173;ina superiorly and &#173;those from the lower ret&#173;ina inferiorly. Fibers from the temporal ret&#173;ina are lateral; &#173;those from the nasal side are medial. Macular fibers, which constitute approximately one-&#173;third of the nerve, occupy the immediate temporal aspect of the ONH. All other temporal fibers with origins distal to the macula are laterally displaced above or below the macular fibers (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-6</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Prelaminar area</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ganglion cell axons that enter the nerve head are supported by a “wicker basket” of astrocytic glial cells and are segregated into bundles, or <span class="italic">fascicles,</span> that pass through the lamina cribrosa (see Fig 3-5). &#173;These astrocytes invest the optic nerve and form continuous circular tubes that enclose groups of nerve fibers throughout their intraocular and intraorbital course, separating them from connective tissue ele&#173;ments at all sites. At the edge of the nerve head, the M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells that make up the internal limiting membrane (ILM) are replaced by astrocytes. Astrocytes constitute 10% of the nerve head volume and form a membrane that not only covers the surface of the nerve head but is continuous with the ILM of the ret&#173;ina.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The pigment epithelium may be exposed at the temporal margin of the ONH to form a narrow, pigmented crescent. When the pigment epithelium and choroid fail to reach the temporal margin, crescents of partial or absent pigmentation may be noted. The relationship between the choroid and the prelaminar portion of the optic nerve partly accounts for the staining of the ONH normally observed in late phases of fluorescein fundus angiography. The ONH vessels do not leak, but the choroidal capillaries are freely permeable to fluorescein, which can therefore diffuse into the adjacent optic nerve layers.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Laminar area</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">lamina cribrosa</span> comprises approximately 10 connective tissue plates, which are integrated with the sclera and whose pores transmit the unmyelinated axon bundles of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal ganglion cells before they exit as the optic nerve. The openings are wider superiorly than inferiorly, which may imply less protection from the mechanical effects of pressure in glaucoma. The lamina contains type I and type III collagens, abundant elastin, laminin, and fibronectin. Astrocytes surround the axon bundles, and small blood vessels are pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The lamina cribrosa serves the following 3 functions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">scaffold for the optic nerve axons</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">point of fixation for the CRA and CRV</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">reinforcement of the posterior segment of the globe</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optical coherence tomography and scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscopy are being used to facilitate anatomical study of the lamina cribrosa in pathologic states such as glaucoma and ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular disease.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Retrolaminar area</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As a result of myelination of the nerve fibers and the presence of oligodendroglia and the surrounding meningeal sheaths (internal, arachnoid, and external) (see Fig 3-5), the dia&#173;meter of the optic nerve increases to 3&#160;mm &#173;behind the lamina cribrosa. The retrolaminar nerve transitions to the intraorbital part of the optic nerve, to the apex of the orbit. The axoplasm of the neurons contains neurofilaments, microtubules, mitochondria, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-12">Intraorbital Region</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Annulus of Zinn</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The intraorbital part of the optic nerve lies within the muscle cone. Before passing into the optic canal, the nerve is surrounded by the annulus of Zinn, which is formed by the origins of the rectus muscles. The superior and medial rectus muscles partially share a connective tissue sheath with the optic nerve. This connection may partly explain why patients with retrobulbar neuritis report symptoms of pain on eye movement.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Meningeal sheaths</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The <span class="italic">internal sheath,</span> the innermost meningeal sheath of the optic nerve, is continuous with the pia mater and arachnoid mater, which cover the brain and spinal cord (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-7</span>). It is a vascular connective tissue coat, covered with meningothelial cells, that sends numerous septa into the optic nerve, dividing its axons into bundles. (The meningothelial cells can give rise to optic nerve sheath meningioma.) The septa continue throughout the intraorbital and intracanalicular regions of the nerve and end just before the chiasm. They contain collagen, elastic tissue, fibroblasts, nerves, and small arterioles and venules. The septa provide mechanical support for the nerve bundles and nutrition to the axons and glial cells. A mantle of astrocytic glial cells prevents the pia and septa from having direct contact with nerve axons.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">arachnoid sheath,</span> which is composed of collagenous tissue and small amounts of elastic tissue, lines the dural sheath and is connected to the internal sheath across the subarachnoid space by vascular trabeculae. The subarachnoid space ends anteriorly at the level of the lamina cribrosa. Posteriorly, it is usually continuous with the subarachnoid space of the brain.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because the central ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels cross this space, a rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) can compress the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein and raise the venous pressure within the ret&#173;ina above the intraocular pressure. This situation &#173;causes intraocular venous dilatation and the loss of spontaneous venous pulsation (SVP) at the nerve head. The presence of SVP indicates normal ICP. However, some individuals have normal ICP and absent SVP. Thus, the loss of previously documented SVP is more indicative of elevated ICP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">external,</span> or <span class="italic">dural, sheath</span> of the optic nerve is the thick outermost meningeal sheath and is continuous with the dura mater in the brain. It is 0.3–0.5&#160;mm thick and consists of dense bundles of collagen and elastic tissue that fuse anteriorly with the outer layers of the sclera.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The meninges of the optic nerve are supplied by sensory nerve fibers, which account in part for the pain experienced by patients with retrobulbar neuritis or other inflammatory optic nerve diseases.</p>
			<p class="h2">Intracanalicular Region</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The optic nerve and surrounding arachnoid sheath are tethered to the periosteum of the bony canal in the intracanalicular region. In blunt trauma, particularly over the eyebrow, the force of injury can be transmitted to the intracanalicular region, causing shearing and interruption of the blood supply to the nerve in this area. Such nerve damage is called <span class="italic">indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</span> In addition, optic nerve edema in this area can lead to a compartment syndrome, further compromising the function of the optic nerve within the confined space of the optic canal.</p>
			<p class="h2">Intracranial Region</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;After passing through the optic canals, the 2 optic nerves lie superior to the ophthalmic arteries and superior and medial to the <span class="italic">internal carotid arteries</span> (<span class="italic">ICAs;</span> see Fig 3-3). The anterior ce&#173;re&#173;bral arteries cross over the optic nerves and are connected by the anterior communicating artery, which completes the anterior portion of the circle of Willis. The optic nerves then pass posteriorly over the cavernous sinus to join in the optic chiasm.</p>
			<p class="h2">Visual Pathway</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The visual pathway begins in the ret&#173;i&#173;na; impulses from the photoreceptors are transmitted to the optic chiasm via the optic nerve of each eye. Within the chiasm, the ret&#173;i&#173;nal fibers segregate into the right and left optic tracts. Each optic tract carries information for its respective field of vision. For example, the right optic tract consists of fibers from the &#173;ipsilateral temporal ret&#173;ina and the contralateral nasal ret&#173;ina. The corresponding hemifields represent the left half of the visual field for each eye. The optic tracts, whose cell bodies lie in the ganglion cell layer of the ret&#173;ina, go on to synapse at the lateral geniculate nucleus. The subsequent fibers further divide as they travel to the primary visual cortex (known variously as <span class="italic">V1, striate cortex,</span> or <span class="italic">Brodmann area&#160;17</span>), where they terminate; the most inferior of the fibers (subserving the superior visual field) take one path and the more superior fibers (subserving the inferior visual field) follow a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent one (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-8</span>). Lesions at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent locations along the visual pathway produce characteristic visual field defects that help localize the site of damage. Structures of the visual pathway are described further in the following sections and in BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span></p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Optic chiasm</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The optic chiasm makes up part of the anterior inferior floor of the third ventricle. It is surrounded by pia and arachnoid mater and is richly vascularized. The chiasm is approximately 12&#160;mm wide, 8&#160;mm long in the anteroposterior direction, and 4&#160;mm thick.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The extramacular fibers from the inferonasal ret&#173;ina cross anteriorly in the chiasm at the “Wilbrand knee” before passing into the optic tract. Extramacular superonasal fibers cross directly to the opposite tract. Extramacular temporal fibers pursue a direct course through the chiasm to the optic tract as a bundle of uncrossed fibers. The macular projections are located centrally in the optic nerve and constitute 80%–90% of the total volume of the optic nerve and the chiasmal fibers. Nasal macular fibers cross in the posterior part of the chiasm. Approximately 53% of the optic nerve fibers are crossed, and 47% are uncrossed.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Optic tract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Each optic tract is made up of fibers from the ipsilateral temporal ret&#173;ina and the contralateral nasal ret&#173;ina. Fibers (both crossed and uncrossed) from the upper ret&#173;i&#173;nal projections travel medially in the optic tract; lower projections move laterally. The macular fibers are dorsolateral within the optic tracts.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Lateral geniculate nucleus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is the synaptic zone for the higher visual projections. It is a mushroom-&#173;shaped structure in the posterior thalamus that receives approximately 70% of the optic tract fibers within its 6 alternating layers of gray and white &#173;matter (the other 30% of the fibers go to the pupillary nucleus). Layers 1, 4, and 6 of the LGN contain axons from the contralateral optic nerve. Layers 2, 3, and 5 arise from the ipsilateral optic nerve. The 6 layers, numbered consecutively from inferior to superior, give rise to the optic radiations (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-9</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Optic radiations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The optic radiations connect the LGN with the visual cortex of the occipital lobe. From the LGN, inferior fibers (which subserve the superior visual field) travel anteriorly, then laterally and posteriorly, looping around the temporal horn of the lateral ventricles in the temporal lobe (Meyer loop). Superior fibers (which subserve the inferior visual field) travel posteriorly through the parietal lobe (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-10</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Primary visual cortex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The primary visual cortex, the thinnest area of the &#173;human ce&#173;re&#173;bral cortex, has 6 cellular layers and occupies the superior and inferior lips of the calcarine fissure (also called <span class="italic">calcarine sulcus</span>) on the posterior and medial surfaces of the occipital lobes. Macular function is extremely well represented in the visual cortex and occupies the most posterior position at the tip of the occipital lobe. The most anterior portion of the calcarine fissure is occupied by contralateral nasal ret&#173;i&#173;nal fibers only (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-11</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2">Blood Supply of the Optic Nerve and Visual Pathway</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The blood supply of the optic nerve varies from one segment of the nerve to another. Although the blood supply can vary widely, a multitude of studies have revealed a basic pattern (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-12</span>). See &#173;Table&#160;3-1, which summarizes the blood supply of the optic nerve. The blood supply of the visual pathway is summarized in &#173;Table&#160;3-2 and depicted in Figure&#160;3-13. The following sections discuss the vascular supply of the intraocular and intraorbital segments in greater detail.</p>
			<p class="h3">Intraocular region</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ophthalmic artery lies inferior to the optic nerve. The CRA and, usually, 2 long posterior ciliary arteries branch off from the ophthalmic artery &#173;after it enters the muscle cone at the annulus of Zinn.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The lumen of the CRA is surrounded by nonfenestrated endothelial cells with typical zonulae occludens that are similar to &#173;those in ret&#173;i&#173;nal blood vessels. The CRA, however, differs from ret&#173;i&#173;nal arterioles in that it contains a fenestrated internal elastic lamina and an outer layer of smooth muscle cells surrounded by a thin basement membrane. The ret&#173;i&#173;nal arterioles have no internal elastic lamina, and they lose their smooth muscle cells shortly &#173;after entering the ret&#173;ina. The CRV consists of endothelial cells, a thin basal lamina, and a thick collagenous adventitia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The lamina cribrosa is supplied by branches of the arterial circle of <span class="italic">Zinn-&#173;Haller</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-14</span>). This circle arises from the para-&#173;optic branches of the short posterior ciliary arteries and is usually embedded in the sclera around the nerve head. It is often incomplete and may be divided into superior and inferior halves. Involvement of the inferior half is the likely cause of altitudinal (superior or inferior hemifield) visual field defects following an episode of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Of note, the posterior ciliary arteries are terminal arteries, and the area where the respective capillary beds from each artery meet is termed the <span class="italic">watershed zone.</span> When perfusion pressure drops, the tissue lying within this area is the most vulnerable to ische&#173;mia. Consequences can be significant when the entire ONH or a part of it lies within the watershed zone.</p>
			<p class="reference--non-journal--single ParaOverride-6">Tan NY, Koh V, Girard MJ, Cheng CY. Imaging of the lamina cribrosa and its role in glaucoma: a review. <span class="reference--non-journal-_italic">Clin Exp Ophthalmol</span>. 2018;46(2):177–188.</p>
			<p class="h3">Intraorbital region</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The intraorbital region of the optic nerve is supplied proximally by the pial vascular network and by neighboring branches of the ophthalmic artery. Distally, it is supplied by intraneural branches of the CRA. Most anteriorly, it is supplied by short posterior ciliary arteries and infrequently by peripapillary choroidal arteries.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Oculomotor Nerve (Third Cranial Nerve)</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although the oculomotor nerve (CN III) contains only 24,000 fibers, it supplies all the extraocular muscles except the superior oblique and the lateral rectus, which are innervated by the trochlear nerve and abducens nerve, respectively. It also provides parasympathetic cholinergic innervation to the pupillary sphincter and the ciliary muscle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CN III arises from a complex group of cells in the rostral midbrain, or <span class="italic">mesencephalon,</span> at the level of the superior colliculus. This nuclear complex lies ventral to the periaqueductal gray &#173;matter, is immediately rostral to the CN IV nuclear complex, and is bounded inferolaterally by the medial longitudinal fasciculus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The CN III nucleus consists of several distinct, large motor cell subnuclei, each of which subserves the extraocular muscle it innervates (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-15</span>). The subnuclei innervate the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">ipsilateral inferior rectus muscle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ipsilateral medial rectus muscle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">contralateral superior rectus muscle</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Except for a single central, caudal subnucleus that serves both levator palpebrae superioris muscles, the cell groups are paired. Notably, the shared innervation of both levator muscles is an example of Hering’s law of equal innervation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fibers from the dorsal subnucleus to the superior rectus uniquely cross, or <span class="italic">decussate,</span> in the caudal aspect of the nucleus and therefore supply the contralateral superior rectus muscles. The Edinger-&#173;Westphal nucleus is rostral in location. It provides the parasympathetic preganglionic efferent innervation to the ciliary muscle and pupillary sphincter. The most ventral subnuclei supply the medial rectus muscles. A subnucleus for ocular convergence has been described but is not consistently found in primates.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The fascicular portion of CN III travels ventrally from the nuclear complex, through the red nucleus, between the medial aspects of the ce&#173;re&#173;bral peduncles, and through the corticospinal fibers (see Fig 3-2). It exits in the interpeduncular space. In the subarachnoid space, CN III passes below the posterior ce&#173;re&#173;bral artery (PCA) and above the superior cerebellar artery, the 2 major branches of the basilar artery (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-16</span>). The nerve travels forward in the interpeduncular cistern lateral to the posterior communicating artery (PCoA) and penetrates the arachnoid between the &#173;free and attached borders of the tentorium cerebelli. About 20% of patients with PCoA aneurysms have isolated oculomotor nerve palsy on pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, and about 80% of aneurysms occurring with CN III palsy &#173;were located in the PCoA—&#173;usually at the junction of the PCoA and the ICA.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The oculomotor nerve pierces the dura mater on the lateral side of the posterior clinoid pro&#173;cess (see Fig 3-24), initially traversing the roof of the cavernous sinus (see Fig 3-25). It runs along the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus and above CN IV and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure (see Fig 3-1).</p>
			<p class="body-text">CN III usually separates into superior and inferior divisions &#173;after passing through the annulus of Zinn in the orbit (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-17</span>). Alternatively, it may divide within the anterior cavernous sinus. The nerve maintains a topographic organ&#173;ization even in the midbrain, so lesions almost anywhere along its course may cause a divisional nerve palsy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The superior division of CN III innervates the superior rectus and levator palpebrae superioris muscles. The larger inferior division splits into 3 branches to supply the medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The parasympathetic fibers wind around the periphery of the nerve, enter the inferior division, and course through the branch that supplies the inferior oblique muscle. They join the ciliary ganglion, where they synapse with the postganglionic fibers, which emerge as many short ciliary nerves. &#173;These nerves pierce the sclera and travel through the choroid to innervate the pupillary sphincter and the ciliary muscle. The superficial location of &#173;these fibers makes them more vulnerable to compression, such as from an aneurysm, than to ischemia.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Pathways for the Pupil Reflexes</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Light reflex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The light reflex (also called <span class="italic">pupillary light reflex, pupillary reflex</span>) consists of a simultaneous and equal constriction of the pupils in response to illumination of one eye or the other (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-18</span>). Of note, when the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave each Edinger-&#173;Westphal nucleus, they run on the superficial surface of the oculomotor nerve (CN III) as it leaves the brainstem, then spiral downward to lie medially in the nerve at the level of the petroclinoid ligament and inferiorly in the inferior division of CN III as it enters the orbit. &#173;These fibers synapse in the ciliary ganglion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-19</span>) and give rise to postganglionic myelinated short ciliary nerves, approximately 3%–5% of which are pupillomotor. The rest are designated for the ciliary muscle and are concerned with the near reflex.</p>
			<p class="h3">Near reflex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The near reflex (also called <span class="italic">near synkinesis, near triad</span>), is a synkinesis that occurs when attention is changed from distance to near (see Fig 3-18). This reflex includes the triad of accommodation, pupil constriction, and convergence. The convergence reflex is initiated in the occipital association cortex, from which impulses descend along corticofugal pathways to relay in pretectal and possibly tegmental areas. From &#173;these relays, fibers pass to the Edinger-&#173;Westphal nuclei and both motor nuclei of the medial rectus muscles. Fibers for the near reflex approach the pretectal nucleus from the ventral aspect; thus, compressive dorsal lesions of the optic tectum spare the near pupil reflex relative to the light reflex (light–&#173;near dissociation). Efferent fibers for accommodation follow the same general pathway as do &#173;those for the light reflex, but their final distribution (via the short ciliary nerves) is to the ciliary muscle.</p>

			<p class="h1">Trochlear Nerve (Fourth Cranial Nerve)</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The trochlear nerve (CN IV) contains the fewest nerve fibers (approximately 3400) of any CN but has the longest intracranial course (75&#160;mm). The nerve nucleus is located in the caudal midbrain at the level of the inferior colliculus near the periaqueductal gray &#173;matter, ventral to the aqueduct of Sylvius. It is continuous with the caudal end of the CN III nucleus and differs histologically from that nucleus only in the smaller size of its cells. Like the CN III nucleus, it is bounded ventrolaterally by the medial longitudinal fasciculus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The fascicles of CN IV curve dorsocaudally around the periaqueductal gray &#173;matter and completely decussate in the superior medullary velum. The nerves exit the brainstem just beneath the inferior colliculus (see Figs 3-1, 3-2). CN IV is the only CN that is completely decussated (the superior rectus subnuclei of CN III proj&#173;ect contralaterally; however, the CN III fascicles themselves do not decussate once they leave the nuclear complex) and the only CN to exit the dorsal surface of the brainstem (see Figs 3-2, 3-22). As it curves around the brainstem in the ambient cistern, CN IV runs beneath the &#173;free edge of the tentorium, passes between the posterior ce&#173;re&#173;bral and superior cerebellar arteries (like CN III, but more laterally), and then pierces the dura mater to enter the cavernous sinus (see Fig 3-24).</p>
			<p class="body-text">CN IV travels beneath CN III and above the ophthalmic division of CN V in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus (see Fig 3-25). It enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure outside the annulus of Zinn and runs superiorly to innervate the superior oblique muscle. &#173;Because of its location outside the muscle cone, CN IV is usually not affected by injection of retrobulbar anesthetics (see Fig 3-17).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Trigeminal Nerve (Fifth Cranial Nerve)</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The trigeminal nerve (CN V), the largest CN, possesses both sensory and motor divisions. The sensory portion serves the greater part of the scalp and the forehead, face, eyelids, eyes, lacrimal glands, extraocular muscles, ears, dura mater, and tongue. The motor portion innervates the muscles of mastication through branches of the mandibular division.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The CN V nuclear complex extends from the midbrain, through the pons and medulla, to the upper cervical segments, often as caudal as the C4 vertebra. It consists of the following 4 nuclei, listed from rostral to caudal:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">mesencephalic nucleus</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">main sensory nucleus</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">spinal nucleus and tract</li>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The mesencephalic nucleus mediates <span class="italic">proprioception</span> and <span class="italic">deep sensation</span> from the masticatory, facial, and extraocular muscles. The nucleus extends inferiorly into the posterior pons as far as the main sensory nucleus.</p>
			<p class="h2">Main Sensory Nucleus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The main sensory nucleus lies in the pons, lateral to the motor nucleus. It is continuous with the mesencephalic nucleus (above) and with the spinal nucleus (below). The main sensory nucleus receives its input from ascending branches of the sensory root, and it serves <span class="italic">light touch</span> from the skin and mucous membranes. The sensory root of CN V, upon entering the pons, divides into an ascending tract and a descending tract. The ascending tract terminates in the main sensory nucleus, and the descending tract ends in the spinal nucleus.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-14">Spinal Nucleus and Tract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The spinal nucleus and tract extend through the medulla to C4. The nucleus receives <span class="italic">pain</span> and <span class="italic">temperature</span> afferents from the descending spinal tract, which also carries cutaneous components of CN VII, CN IX, and CN X that serve sensations from the ear and external auditory meatus. The sensory fibers from the ophthalmic division of CN V (V<span class="subscript CharOverride-3">1</span>) terminate in the most ventral portion of the spinal nucleus and tract. Fibers from the maxillary division (V<span class="subscript CharOverride-3">2</span>) end in the midportion of the spinal nucleus (in a ventral–&#173;dorsal plane). The fibers from the mandibular division (V<span class="subscript CharOverride-3">3</span>) end in the dorsal parts of the nucleus (the 3 divisions of CN V are discussed in greater detail &#173;later in the chapter).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The cutaneous territory of each of the CN V divisions is represented in the spinal nucleus and tract in a rostral–&#173;caudal direction. Fibers from the perioral region are thought to terminate most rostrally in the nucleus; fibers from the peripheral face and scalp end in the caudal portion. The zone between them, the midfacial region, is projected onto the central portion of the nucleus. This “onionskin” pattern of cutaneous sensation (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-20</span>) has been revealed by clinical studies of patients with damage to the spinal nucleus and tract.</p>

			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-16">Axons from the main sensory and spinal nuclei, as well as portions of the mesencephalic nucleus, relay sensory information to higher sensory areas of the brain. The axons cross the midline in the pons and ascend to the thalamus along the ventral and dorsal trigeminothalamic tracts. They terminate in the nerve cells of the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus. &#173;These cells, in turn, send axons through the internal capsule to the postcentral gyrus of the ce&#173;re&#173;bral cortex.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The afferent limb of the oculocardiac reflex is mediated by the trigeminal nerve. It is connected to the efferent limb, which is mediated by the parasympathetic neurons of the vagus nerve, via short internuncial fibers to the reticular formation.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Motor Nucleus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The motor nucleus is located in the pons, medial to the main sensory nucleus. It receives fibers from both ce&#173;re&#173;bral hemi&#173;spheres, the reticular formation, the red nucleus, the tectum, the medial longitudinal fasciculus, and the mesencephalic nucleus. The motor nucleus gives rise to the axons that form the motor root, which supplies the muscles of mastication (pterygoid, masseter, and temporalis), the tensor tympani muscle, the tensor veli palatini muscle, the mylohyoid muscle, and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Intracranial Pathway of Cranial Nerve V</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The intracranial segment of the trigeminal nerve emerges from the upper lateral portion of the ventral pons, passes over the petrous apex (the crest of the petrous part of temporal bone), forms the <span class="italic">trigeminal ganglion,</span> and then divides into 3 branches (see Figs 3-1, 3-2). The trigeminal ganglion, also called the <span class="italic">gasserian</span> or <span class="italic">semilunar ganglion,</span> contains the cell bodies of origin of all CN V sensory axons. The crescent-&#173;shaped ganglion occupies a recess in the dura mater posterolateral to the cavernous sinus. This recess, called the <span class="italic">Meckel cave,</span> is near the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone in the &#173;middle cranial fossa. Medially, the trigeminal ganglion is close to the ICA and the posterior cavernous sinus.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Divisions of Cranial Nerve V</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The 3 divisions of CN V are the ophthalmic (V<span class="subscript CharOverride-3">1</span>), the maxillary (V<span class="subscript CharOverride-3">2</span>), and the mandibular (V<span class="subscript CharOverride-3">3</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Ophthalmic division (CN V<span class="h3_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ophthalmic division enters the cavernous sinus lateral to the ICA and courses beneath CN III and CN IV (see Figs 3-24, 3-25). Within the sinus, it gives off a tentorial–&#173;dural branch, which innervates the ce&#173;re&#173;bral vessels, dura mater of the anterior fossa, cavernous sinus, sphenoid wing, petrous apex, Meckel cave, tentorium cerebelli, falx cerebri, and dural venous sinuses. CN V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> passes into the orbit through the superior orbital fissure and divides into 3 branches: frontal, lacrimal, and nasociliary (see Fig 3-17).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Frontal nerve</span> The frontal nerve (see Fig 3-19) divides into the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves, which provide sensation to the medial portion of the upper eyelid and the conjunctiva, forehead, scalp, frontal sinuses, and side of the nose. The supratrochlear nerve exits the orbit 17&#160;mm from midline, whereas the supraorbital nerve exits at 27&#160;mm from midline, through &#173;either a notch or a true foramen.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Lacrimal nerve</span> The lacrimal nerve innervates the lacrimal gland and the neighboring conjunctiva and skin. The lacrimal gland receives its parasympathetic supply from the retro-&#173;orbital plexus (<span class="xref-local">discussed &#173;later, in the section</span> Facial Nerve [Seventh Cranial Nerve]). Occasionally, the lacrimal nerve exits the orbit via a lacrimal foramen to supply the lateral forehead. Other&#173;wise, that area is supplied by branches of the supraorbital nerve.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-17"><span class="h4-head">Nasociliary nerve</span> Branches from the nasociliary nerve supply sensation to the &#173;middle and inferior turbinates, septum, lateral nasal wall, and tip of the nose. The infratrochlear branch serves the lacrimal drainage system, the conjunctiva, and the skin of the medial canthal region. The ciliary nerves (short and long) carry sensory fibers from the ciliary body, the iris, and the cornea. The short ciliary nerves also carry the sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers from the ciliary ganglion to the iris dilator and sphincter, respectively, and the parasympathetic fibers to the ciliary muscle (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-21</span>). The sensory short ciliary fibers pass through the ciliary ganglion to join, along with the long ciliary fibers, the nasociliary nerve. Thus, the short ciliary nerves carry sensory (V<span class="h4-text_subscript CharOverride-3">1</span>), sympathetic, and parasympathetic fibers (see Fig 3-19).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Maxillary division (CN V<span class="h3_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The maxillary division leaves the trigeminal ganglion to exit the skull through the foramen rotundum, which lies below the superior orbital fissure (see Fig 3-1). CN V<span class="subscript CharOverride-3">2</span> courses through the pterygopalatine fossa into the inferior orbital fissure and then passes through the infraorbital canal as the infraorbital nerve. &#173;After exiting the infraorbital foramen, CN V<span class="subscript CharOverride-3">2</span> divides into an inferior palpebral branch, a nasal branch, and a superior labial branch, supplying the lower eyelid, the side of the nose, and the upper lip, respectively. The teeth, maxillary sinus, roof of the mouth, and soft palate are also innervated by branches of the maxillary division. &#173;These branches can be damaged &#173;after fractures of the orbital floor.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-18">Abducens Nerve (Sixth Cranial Nerve)</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The nucleus of the abducens nerve (CN VI) is situated in the floor of the fourth ventricle, beneath the facial colliculus in the caudal pons. The medial longitudinal fasciculus lies medial to the CN VI nucleus. The fascicular portion of CN VI runs ventrally through the paramedian pontine reticular formation and the pyramidal tract and leaves the brainstem in the pontomedullary junction (see Figs 3-1, <span class="xref-figure">3-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">CN VI then takes a vertical course along the ventral face of the pons and is crossed by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. It continues through the subarachnoid space along the surface of the clivus to perforate the dura mater below the petrous apex, approximately 2&#160;cm below the posterior clinoid pro&#173;cess (see Fig 3-24). It then passes intradurally through or around the inferior petrosal sinus and beneath the petroclinoid (Gruber) ligament through the Dorello canal, &#173;after which it becomes extradural and enters the cavernous sinus. This long route (especially along the surface of the clivus and beneath the petroclinoid ligament) is responsible for this nerve’s susceptibility to stretch injury leading to paresis in the context of increased intracranial pressure. In the cavernous sinus, CN VI runs below and lateral to the ICA and may transiently carry sympathetic fibers from the carotid plexus (see Fig 3-25). It passes through the superior orbital fissure within the annulus of Zinn to enter the medial surface of the lateral rectus muscle, which it innervates.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-18">Facial Nerve (Seventh Cranial Nerve)</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The facial nerve (CN VII) is a complex, mixed sensory and motor nerve. The motor root contains special visceral efferent fibers that innervate the muscles of facial expression. The sensory root conveys the sense of taste from the anterior two-&#173;thirds of the tongue and sensation from the external auditory meatus and the retroauricular skin. It also provides preganglionic parasympathetic innervation by way of the sphenopalatine and submandibular ganglia to the lacrimal, submaxillary, and sublingual glands.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The motor nucleus of CN VII is a cigar-&#173;shaped column 4&#160;mm long, located in the caudal third of the pons. It is ventrolateral to the CN VI nucleus, ventromedial to the spinal nucleus of CN V, and dorsal to the superior olive (Fig 3-22; see also Fig 3-2A). The signal for facial movement starts in the primary motor cortex in the precentral gyrus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The dorsal motor subnucleus controls the upper half of the face and receives corticobulbar input from <span class="italic">both</span> ce&#173;re&#173;bral hemi&#173;spheres, whereas the lateral subnucleus controls the lower half of the face and receives corticobulbar input from the <span class="italic">contralateral</span> ce&#173;re&#173;bral hemi&#173;sphere. Therefore, pathology involving the CN VII nucleus would affect only the contralateral lower face; peripheral CN VII pathology &#173;causes an ipsilateral hemifacial palsy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The facial nerve has several impor&#173;tant anatomical relationships with adjacent structures. Fibers from the motor nucleus course dorsomedially to approach the floor of the fourth ventricle and then ascend immediately dorsal to the CN VI nucleus. At the rostral end of the CN VI nucleus, the main facial motor fibers arch over its dorsal surface (forming the internal genu of CN VII) and then pass ventrolaterally between the spinal nucleus of CN V and the CN VII nucleus to exit the brainstem at the pontomedullary junction. The bulge formed by the CN VII genu in the floor of the fourth ventricle is the <span class="italic">facial colliculus</span> (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Figs 3-2A, 3-22</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">CNs VII and VIII (the acoustic nerve) pass together through the lateral pontine cistern in the cerebellopontine &#173;angle and enter the internal auditory meatus in a common meningeal sheath.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The main branch of CN VII exits the stylomastoid foramen just &#173;behind the styloid pro&#173;cess at the base of the mastoid. It then passes through the superficial and deep lobes of the parotid gland and divides into the superior temporofacial branch (which further divides into the temporal, zygomatic, and buccal subbranches) and the cervicofacial branch. Commonly, the temporal branch supplies the upper half of the orbicularis oculi muscle, and the zygomatic branch supplies the lower half, although the inferior orbicularis is sometimes innervated by the buccal branch. The frontalis, corrugator supercilii, and pyramidalis muscles are usually innervated by the temporal branch.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The temporal (or frontal) branch of the facial nerve crosses the zygomatic arch superficially at the junction of the anterior one-&#173;third and posterior two-&#173;thirds of the arch. It then enters the more superficial layer of the temporoparietal fascia while staying below the <span class="italic">superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS).</span> A good approximation of the course of the nerve across the zygomatic arch follows the point at which a line between the tragus and the lateral eyelid commissure is bisected by a line that begins at the earlobe. The nerve can be injured in the context of perizygomatic or &#173;temple surgical approaches, such as Tenzel or Mustard<span class="accent">é</span> semicircular flap reconstruction of the eyelid, temporal artery biopsy, and cosmetic forehead and midface surgery.</p>
			<p class="h2">Tear Reflex Pathway</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Reflex</span> lacrimation is controlled by afferents from the sensory nuclei of CN V. The tear reflex arc is shown in Figure&#160;3-23. The efferent preganglionic parasympathetic fibers pass peripherally as part of the nervus intermedius and divide into 2 groups near the external genu of CN VII. The lacrimal group of fibers passes to the pterygopalatine ganglion in the greater superficial petrosal nerve. The salivatory group of fibers proj&#173;ects through the chorda tympani nerve to the submandibular ganglion to innervate the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The greater superficial petrosal nerve extends forward on the anterior surface of the petrous part of temporal bone to join the deep petrosal nerve (sympathetic fibers) and form the nerve of the pterygoid canal (vidian nerve). This nerve enters the pterygopalatine fossa; joins the pterygopalatine ganglion; and gives rise to unmyelinated postganglionic fibers that innervate the globe, lacrimal gland, glands of the palate, and nose. The parasympathetic fibers destined for the orbit enter it via the superior orbital fissure, along with branches of the ophthalmic nerve (CN V<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>). &#173;Here, they are joined by sympathetic fibers from the carotid plexus and form a retro-&#173;orbital plexus of nerves, whose rami oculares supply orbital vessels or enter the globe to supply the choroid and anterior segment structures. Some of &#173;these fibers enter the globe directly; &#173;others enter via connections with the short ciliary nerves. The rami oculares also supply the lacrimal gland.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Emotional</span> lacrimation is mediated by parasympathetic efferent fibers originating in the superior salivatory nucleus and the lacrimal nucleus in the caudal pons, both of which lie posterolateral to the motor nucleus. The lacrimal nucleus receives input from the hypothalamus, mediating emotional tearing; &#173;there is also supranuclear input from the cortex and the limbic system.</p>

The temporal ret&#173;ina has a thicker layer of ganglion cells, representing the increased ganglion cell concentration found in the macula. M<span class="figure-caption_accent">ü</span>ller glia traverse the neural ret&#173;ina to provide both structural and functional support. Where the ret&#173;ina terminates at the ONH edge, the M<span class="figure-caption_accent">ü</span>ller cells are continuous with the astrocytes, forming the internal limiting membrane. The border tissue of Elschnig is the dense connective tissue that joins the sclera with the Bruch membrane, enclosing the choroid and forming the scleral ring that defines the margin of the ONH. At the posterior termination of the choroid on the temporal side, the border tissue of Elschnig lies between the astrocytes surrounding the optic nerve canal and the stroma of the choroid. On the nasal side, the choroidal stroma is directly adjacent to the astrocytes surrounding the nerve. This collection of astrocytes surrounding the canal is known as the <span class="figure-caption_italic">border tissue,</span> which is continuous with a similar glial lining at the termination of the ret&#173;ina. The nerve fibers of the ret&#173;ina are segregated into approximately 1000 fascicles by astrocytes. On reaching the lamina cribrosa <span class="figure-caption_italic">(upper dashed line),</span> the nerve fascicles and their surrounding astrocytes are separated from each other by connective tissue. The lamina cribrosa is an extension of scleral collagen and elastic fibers through the nerve. The external choroid also sends some connective tissue to the anterior part of the lamina. At the external part of the lamina cribrosa <span class="figure-caption_italic">(lower dashed line),</span> the nerve fibers become myelinated, and columns of oligodendrocytes and a few astrocytes are pres&#173;ent within the nerve fascicles. The bundles continue to be separated by connective tissue septa (derived from pia mater and known as <span class="figure-caption_italic">septal tissue</span>) all the way to the chiasm<span class="figure-caption_italic">.</span> A mantle of astrocytes, continuous anteriorly with the border tissue, surrounds the nerve along its orbital course. The dura, arachnoid, and pia mater are shown. The nerve fibers are myelinated. Within the bundles, the cell bodies of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes form a column of nuclei. The central ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels are surrounded by a perivascular connective tissue throughout its course in the nerve. This connective tissue, known as the <span class="figure-caption_italic">central supporting connective tissue strand,</span> blends with the connective tissue of the lamina cribrosa. 1 <span class="figure-caption_symbol">=</span> superficial nerve fiber layer; 2 <span class="figure-caption_symbol">=</span> prelaminar area; 3 <span class="figure-caption_symbol">=</span> laminar area; 4 <span class="figure-caption_symbol">=</span> retrolaminar area. <span class="figure-source-note">(Illustration by Mark Miller.)</span></p>
