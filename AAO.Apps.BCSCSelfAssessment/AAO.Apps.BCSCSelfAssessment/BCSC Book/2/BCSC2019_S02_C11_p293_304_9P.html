			<div id="Chapt11_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">During formation of the eye, the <span class="italic">primary vitreous</span> contributes the hyaloid artery, which nourishes the developing anterior segment and lens. Failure of the vitreous to regress following this stage leads to pathology of the anterior and/or posterior segment. See BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous,</span> for further discussion of per&#173;sis&#173;tent fetal vasculature (also called <span class="italic">per&#173;sis&#173;tent hyperplastic primary vitreous</span>). The <span class="italic">secondary vitreous</span> consists of a gel matrix representing the largest structure of the eye and is routinely seen on clinical examination. The <span class="italic">tertiary vitreous</span> gives rise to the zonular fibers. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span> for additional discussion of development of the vitreous.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In adulthood, the vitreous is less dynamic than during ocular development and acts as a conduit for nutrients and other solutes between the lens and the vitreous and for fluid to and across the ret&#173;ina (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-1</span>). It occupies a volume of 4&#160;mL and has an osmotic pressure and index of refraction (1.334) similar to &#173;those of the aqueous humor. Its viscosity, however, is almost twice that of &#173;water. The basic physical structure of the vitreous is that of a gel composed of a collagen framework interspersed with molecules of hydrated hyaluronan, also known as <span class="italic">hyaluronic acid</span>. The hyaluronan contributes to the viscosity of the vitreous humor and is thought to help stabilize the collagen network.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The relative amounts of collagen determine &#173;whether the vitreous is a liquid or a gel. The rigidity of the gel is greatest in regions of highest collagen concentration: the peri&#173;ph&#173;eral&#160;(cortical) vitreous and the vitreous base. The collagen fibrils confer re&#173;sis&#173;tance to tensile forces and give plasticity to the vitreous; the hyaluronan resists compression and confers viscoelastic properties. Degeneration of &#173;these fibrils occurs in most of the population and occasionally leads to ret&#173;i&#173;nal pathology.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Composition</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The vitreous is composed primarily of &#173;water (≈98%) and macromolecules (0.15%), including collagen, hyaluronan, and soluble proteins. &#173;There are very few resident cells in the vitreous; &#173;these are called <span class="italic">hyalocytes</span> (see Fig&#160;11-4). In addition to the 2 major structural components, collagen and hyaluronan, several noncollagenous structural proteins and glycoproteins have been identified in the vitreous; &#173;these include chondroitin sulfate (versican), opticin, VIT1, and fibrillin. The &#173;human vitreous also contains hyaluronidase and at least 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2, or <span class="italic">gelatinase</span>), suggesting that turnover of vitreous structural macromolecules can occur.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Collagen</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">At pre&#173;sent, 19 types of collagen are known, and the genes for several more have been identified. Tropocollagen, the smallest molecular unit of the vari&#173;ous collagen types, is arranged in a specific pattern to create collagen fibrils. Aggregation of fibrils, sometimes of dif&#173;fer&#173;ent types, gives rise to collagen fibers. Vitreous collagen fibers are composed of 3&#160;dif&#173;fer&#173;ent collagen types (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-2</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Type II fibrils are the major structural component of the fiber and are also found in cartilage.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Type IX fibrils, found on the surface of the fiber, act to shield type II collagen fibrils and prevent them from fusing together, which can lead to condensation of vitreous collagen.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-5">Type V/XI fibrils, located in the core of collagen fibers, likely participate in the initial stages of fiber formation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The vitreous collagens are closely related to the collagens of hyaline cartilage. They differ from the collagens (types I, III, XII, and XIV) commonly found in scar tissue and in tissues such as dermis, cornea, and sclera.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Collagen fibers are condensed in the peripheral vitreous, which comprises the cortical vitreous and has a thickness of approximately 100–300 <span class="greek">μ</span>m. The vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal interface exists between the cortical vitreous and the internal limiting membrane (ILM). Inter&#173;action between the collagen fibers of the cortical vitreous (known as the <span class="italic">posterior hyaloid</span> over the posterior pole) and the ILM is mediated by laminin, fibronectin, and the proteoglycan chondroitin sulfate, among &#173;others (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-3</span>). The adhesion of cortical vitreous to the ILM is relatively weak in the posterior pole compared with adhesion in the region near the vitreous base, where the fibers are firmly anchored to the peripheral ret&#173;ina and pars plana.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Hyaluronan and Chondroitin Sulfate</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Hyaluronan is pre&#173;sent in nearly all vertebrate connective tissues and is nontoxic and nonimmunogenic. It is a polysaccharide (glycosaminoglycan, or GAG) that has a repeating unit of glucuronic acid and <span class="italic">N</span>-&#173;acetylglucosamine. At physiologic pH, hyaluronan is a weak polyanion &#173;because of the ionization of the carboxyl groups pre&#173;sent in each glucuronic acid residue. This ionization, together with the GAG residues, confers a negative charge on hyaluronan. The negative charge attracts sodium and thereby &#173;water, resulting in hydration of the vitreous. Production of hyaluronan begins around the time of birth, when the corresponding hydration has been proposed to contribute to vitreous transparency and growth of the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In &#173;free solution, hyaluronan occupies an extremely high volume relative to its weight and may fill all the space in the vitreous except for that occupied by the collagen fibers (see Fig&#160;11-2B). Hyaluronan molecules of the vitreous may undergo lateral interactions with one another, and such interactions may be stabilized by noncollagenous proteins. Both the concentration and the molecular weight of hyaluronan in the vitreous vary, depending on the species and on the location in the vitreous body, with higher concentrations typically found in the posterior pole.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Chondroitin sulfate is also a GAG, but unlike hyaluronan, it is sulfated. Chondroitin sulfate plays an in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent role in maintaining the ultrastructure of the vitreous. Versican is the predominant form of chondroitin sulfate in the vitreous, where it interacts with hyaluronan. Versican has been reported to participate in the formation of the vitreous gel.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Soluble and Collagen Fiber–&#173;Associated Proteins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many proteins remain in solution &#173;after the collagen fibers and other insoluble ele&#173;ments pre&#173;sent in the vitreous gel are removed by filtration or centrifugation. Serum albumin is the major soluble vitreous protein, followed by transferrin. Other proteins include neutrophil elastase inhibitor (which may play a role in resisting neovascularization) and tissue plasminogen activator (which may have a fibrinolytic role in the event of vitreous hemorrhage). The concentration of serum proteins in the vitreous gel depends on the integrity of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculature and the degree of intraocular inflammation. Consequently, if the blood–&#173;ocular barrier is compromised, the concentration of soluble proteins within the vitreous cavity can rise dramatically.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some structural proteins are specifically associated with the collagen fibers. &#173;These include a leucine-&#173;rich repeat glycoprotein called <span class="italic">opticin,</span> which is produced in the posterior nonpigmented ciliary epithelium (NPE), and another glycoprotein called <span class="italic">VIT1.</span> Both opticin and VIT1 are thought to play key roles in the structure of collagen fibers and to interact with proteoglycans within the vitreous.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Zonular Fibers</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some zonular fibers are pre&#173;sent in the anterior vitreous and can be observed by electron microscopy. However, most of &#173;these fibers form the zonular apparatus, which is the structural connection between the lens and the ciliary body. The major structural protein of &#173;these fibers is a large linear protein named <span class="italic">fibrillin,</span> which has an unusually high cysteine content.</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-12"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" src="BCSC2019_S02_C11_p293_304_9P-web-resources/image/3.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-13">Low-&#173;Molecular-&#173;Weight Solutes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ions and organic solutes in the vitreous originate from adjacent ocular tissues and blood plasma. The barriers that control their entry into the vitreous include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">vascular endothelium of iris vessels</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">nonpigmented epithelium of the ciliary body</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">inner wall endothelium of the Schlemm canal</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">vascular endothelium of ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Together, &#173;these structures constitute the blood–&#173;ocular barrier. The concentrations of sodium (Na<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-2">+</span>) and chloride (Cl<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-2">−</span>) in the vitreous are similar to &#173;those in plasma, but the concentration of potassium (K<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-2">+</span>) is higher than that in plasma, as is that of ascorbate.</p>

			<p class="h2">Hyalocytes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Under normal physiologic conditions, the vitreous cavity has very few cells. The predominant cell type identified is the hyalocyte (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-4</span>). The highest concentration of &#173;these cells occurs at the vitreous base and in the posterior cortical vitreous. Hyalocytes possess phagocytic properties, pro&#173;cess antigens, and thereby regulate the immunologic response within the vitreous cavity. A pro&#173;cess similar to anterior chamber–&#173;associated immune deviation (ACAID) occurs in the vitreous cavity (VCAID) and is likely mediated by hyalocytes.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Vitreous Liquefaction and Posterior Vitreous Detachment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The &#173;human vitreous gel undergoes progressive liquefaction beginning around 40&#160;years of age, so that typically by age 80–90&#160;years, more than half of the vitreous is liquid. A&#160;crucial step in the pro&#173;cess of vitreous liquefaction is the breakdown of the thin &#173;(12–15-nm) collagen fibrils into smaller fragments. Implicated in this pro&#173;cess is reduced shielding of type II collagen fibrils due to the age-&#173;related exponential loss of type IX collagen. Some proteolytic enzymes, such as plasminogen, may have elevated vitreous concentrations with increasing age, but &#173;others, such as MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2), do not.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The fragments aggregate into thicker fibers, or <span class="italic">fibrillar opacities,</span> which are vis&#173;i&#173;ble with low-&#173;power slit-&#173;lamp microscopy. As liquefaction proceeds, the collagen fibers become condensed into the residual gel phase and are absent from (or in low concentration in) the liquid phase. In terms of hyaluronan concentration or molecular weight, &#173;there are no differences between the gel and liquid phases. With increasing age, a weakening of adhesion occurs at the vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal interface, which lies between the cortical vitreous gel and the ILM. &#173;These combined pro&#173;cesses eventually result in posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in approximately 50% of individuals &#173;after 50&#160;years of age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">PVD is a separation of the cortical vitreous gel from the ILM as far anteriorly as the posterior border of the vitreous base; the separation does not extend into the vitreous base owing to the unbreakable adhesion between the vitreous and ret&#173;ina in that zone (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;11-</span><span class="xref-figure">5</span>). PVD is often a sudden event, during which liquefied vitreous from the center of the vitreous body passes through a hole in the posterior vitreous cortex, at its attachment to the optic nerve, and then dissects the residual cortical vitreous away from the ILM. As the residual vitreous gel collapses anteriorly within the vitreous cavity, ret&#173;i&#173;nal tears sometimes occur in areas where the ret&#173;ina is more strongly attached to the vitreous than the surrounding ret&#173;ina can withstand, which subsequently can result in rhegmato&#173;genous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Anomalous PVD can lead to the formation of epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membranes and macular holes (see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2">Myopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Myopia is associated with faster liquefaction and &#173;earlier development of PVD. Vitreous samples taken from myopic eyes exhibit a higher concentration of MMP-2. MMPs are proteases involved in remodeling extracellular matrices, such as the vitreous. Physiologically, MMPs can facilitate cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. Pathologically, they participate in inflammatory responses and promote angiogenesis. Premature vitreous liquefaction may be a result of increased MMP activity, leading to vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal pathologies in myopic individuals.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-16">Vitreous as an Inhibitor of Angiogenesis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Numerous studies have shown that the normal vitreous is an inhibitor of angiogenesis. This inhibitory activity is decreased in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. However, the molecular basis of the phenomenon remains poorly understood. Known inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as thrombospondin 1 and pigment epithelium–&#173;derived &#173;factor, are pre&#173;s&#173;ent within the mammalian vitreous and may inhibit angiogenesis in healthy eyes. The vitreous protein opticin also suppresses angiogenesis in mouse models of ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization. In contrast, the level of vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF), a promoter of angiogenesis, is markedly elevated in the vitreous of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, a condition in which the vitreous also acts as a scaffold for ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--first ParaOverride-17">Le Goff&#160;MM, Lu&#160;H, Ugarte&#160;M, et&#160;al. The vitreous glycoprotein opticin inhibits preret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization. <span class="italic">Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci.</span> 2012;53(1):228–234.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Physiologic Changes &#173;After Vitrectomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most of the changes in ocular physiology that occur &#173;after vitrectomy result from altered viscosity in the vitreous cavity; when the vitreous is removed, the viscosity decreases between 300-&#173; and 2000-&#173;fold. Consequently, growth &#173;factors and other compounds, such as antibiotics, transfer between the posterior and anterior segments more easily and are also cleared more quickly from the eye. This effect is proportional to the change in diffusion coefficient, which is of the same magnitude as the change in viscosity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fluid currents that move solutes even more rapidly may be pre&#173;sent (see Fig&#160;11-1). In par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, oxygen movement is accelerated. The oxygen gradient that exists between the well-&#173;oxygenated anterior segment and the posterior segment &#173;under normal physiologic conditions is abolished. This leads to increased oxygen tension in the vitreous cavity. &#173;Under physiologic conditions, vitreous ascorbate combines with oxygen, forming dehydroascorbate and &#173;water. However, &#173;after vitrectomy, oxygen levels exceed the capacity of ascorbate, leading to increased oxidative stress at the posterior pole of the lens and the development of cataract (Fig&#160;11-6).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-18">Injury With Hemorrhage and Inflammation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Injury to the eye can result in inflammation and, in many cases, intraocular hemorrhage. If blood penetrates the vitreous cortex, platelets come into contact with vitreous collagen, aggregate, and initiate clot formation. The clot in turn stimulates a phagocytic inflammatory reaction, and the vitreous becomes liquefied in the area of a hemorrhage. The subsequent inflammatory reaction varies in degree for unknown reasons and may result in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (see also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;12</span>, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic Disease Involving the Vitreous</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Stickler syndrome is most commonly due to a mutation in the gene <span class="italic">COL2A1,</span> which codes for type II collagen, a major component of vitreous collagen fibers.
