			<p class="h1">Introduction to Pharmacologic Principles</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This chapter reviews the general princi&#173;ples of pharmacology and includes discussion of special features of the eye that facilitate or impede ocular therapy.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Pharmacokinetics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pharmacokinetics concerns the movement of a drug through the body, including the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of that drug. To achieve a therapeutic effect, a drug must reach its site of action in sufficient concentration. The concentration at the site of action is a function of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5">route of administration</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">amount administered</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">extent and rate of absorption at the administration site</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">distribution and binding of the drug in tissues</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">movement by bulk flow in circulating fluids</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">transport between body compartments</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">biotransformation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-6">excretion</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pharmacokinetics and dose together determine <span class="italic">bioavailability,</span> or concentration of the active drug at the therapeutic site.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Pharmacodynamics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pharmacodynamics concerns the biological activity and clinical effects of a drug—&#173;the drug action &#173;after distribution (pharmacokinetics) of the active agent to the therapeutic site. Included within the area of pharmacodynamics are the tissue receptor for the drug and the intracellular changes initiated by binding of the active drug with the receptor. The pharmacodynamic action of a drug is often described using the receptor for that drug; for example, a drug may be categorized as an <span class="greek">a</span>-&#173;adrenergic agonist or a <span class="greek">b</span>-&#173;adrenergic antagonist.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Pharmacotherapeutics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pharmacotherapeutics is the study of the uses of drugs in reaching a given clinical endpoint, such as the prevention or treatment of disease. The therapeutic dose may vary for any patient and is related to the patient’s age, sex, race, other currently prescribed medi&#173;cations, and preexisting medical conditions. Pharmacotherapeutics is covered in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span>.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Toxicity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Toxicity</span> refers to the adverse effects of &#173;either medi&#173;cations or environmental chemicals, including poisoning. Toxicity may be influenced by pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics (the biochemical and physiological effects of a drug/agent). For example, topically applied ophthalmic medi&#173;cations are readily absorbed through the mucous membranes of the eye and nasopharynx, as well as through the iris and ciliary body. Topical absorption avoids the first-&#173;pass metabolism of the liver and increases systemic bioavailability. Therefore, the systemic toxicity of &#173;these medi&#173;cations may be greater than expected relative to the total topical dose.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The importance of pharmacokinetics and its influence on potential toxicity can be illustrated by the pediatric population. Drug metabolism and excretion are less developed in neonates and infants than in adults. For example, in early neonatal life, the drug-&#173;metabolizing activities of the cytochrome P450–&#173;dependent, mixed-&#173;function oxidases and the conjugating enzymes are approximately 50%–70% of &#173;those in adults. A second example is the formation of glucuronide, which does not reach adult levels &#173;until the third or fourth year of life. Similarly, the glomerular filtration rate is low in young infants, reaching the adult value by 6–12 months of life. Therefore, drug doses and dosing schedules must be adjusted appropriately in pediatric populations to avoid toxicity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Local toxicity of topical drugs is more common than systemic toxicity. Local toxicity may be a type I immunoglobulin E (IgE)–&#173;mediated hypersensitivity reaction, or it may represent a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to &#173;either the medi&#173;cation itself or its associated preservatives.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Preservatives and toxicity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Preservatives commonly used in ophthalmic preparations include quaternary cationic surfactants such as benzalkonium chloride and benzododecinium bromide; mercurial agents such as thimerosal, chlorobutanol, and parahydroxybenzoates; and aromatic alcohols. The preservatives used in ophthalmic solutions can be toxic to the ocular surface following topical administration; they can also enhance the corneal permeability of vari&#173;ous drugs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Preservatives have been developed that use dif&#173;fer&#173;ent methods to reduce the toxic effect on the ocular surface. One method allows the preservative to dissipate upon exposure to light or to the ions in the tear film. Two examples of preservatives using this method are stabilized oxychloro complex, which breaks down to sodium chloride and &#173;water, and sodium perborate, which breaks down to hydrogen peroxide before becoming oxygen and hydrogen. Theoretically, &#173;these “disappearing preservatives” should have no toxic effect on the corneal surface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other preservative systems may be less toxic to the ocular surface than quaternary cationic surfactants such as benzalkonium chloride. One such system is an ionic buffer containing borate, sorbitol, propylene glycol, and zinc that breaks down into innate ele&#173;ments upon encountering the cations in the tear film. Polyquaternium-1, another preservative system, is a cationic polymer of quaternary ammonium structures that lacks a hydrophobic region. Although polyquaternium-1 is a detergent, &#173;human corneal epithelial cells tend to repel the compound.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To completely eliminate toxicity from preservatives, some topical ophthalmic products are available preservative-&#173;free, in single-&#173;use containers.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Pharmacologic Princi&#173;ples and El&#173;derly Patients</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pharmacologic princi&#173;ples apply differently to el&#173;derly patients. Compared with younger patients, el&#173;derly patients have less lean body mass &#173;because of a decrease in muscle bulk, less body &#173;water and albumin, and an increased relative percentage of adipose tissue. &#173;These physiologic differences alter tissue binding and distribution of a drug. &#173;Human renal function declines with age; both hepatic perfusion and enzymatic activity are variably affected as well. Older patients tend to take more medi&#173;cations for chronic conditions than do younger patients, and many of the drugs they use are pro&#173;cessed si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously by their already-&#173;compromised metabolic systems.</p>
			<p class="sidebar--text-no-indent- ParaOverride-9"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="Operator_BCSC2019_S02_C15_p347_368_2P-web-resources/image/2.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text">The pharmacokinetic pro&#173;cessing of drugs in el&#173;derly patients is thus significantly altered, extending the effective half-&#173;life of most medi&#173;cations. The pharmacodynamic action of a drug is often in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dently potentiated in &#173;these patients. The increase in both drug effect and adverse effects occurs even when the dose is decreased in consideration of &#173;these pharmacokinetic differences. Thus, the pharmacotherapeutic effects and toxicity of a medi&#173;cation may be altered simply by the aging pro&#173;cess, in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent of drug dosage. Accordingly, the se&#173;lection of a specific therapeutic agent should be guided by the general health and age of the individual, as well as by concomitant medi&#173;cation used by the patient.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-11">Pharmacokinetics: The Route of Drug Delivery</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Topical Administration: Eyedrops</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most ocular medi&#173;cations are administered topically as eyedrops. This route of administration maximizes the anterior segment concentrations while minimizing systemic toxicity. The drug gradient, from the concentrated tear reservoir to the relatively barren corneal and conjunctival epithelia, forces a passive route of absorption (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;15-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Retention of topical agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some features of topical ocular therapy limit treatment effectiveness. Very &#173;little of an administered drop is retained by the eye. When a 50-&#173;μL drop is delivered from a conventional commercial dispenser, the volume of the tear lake rises from 7 μL to only 10&#160;μL in the blinking eye of an upright patient. Thus, at most, 20% of the administered drug is retained (10 μL/50 μL). A rapid turnover of fluid also occurs in the tear lake—16% per minute in the undisturbed eye—&#173;with even faster turnover if the drop elicits reflex tearing. Consequently, for slowly absorbed drugs, at most only 50% of the drug that was initially retained in the tear reservoir, or 10% of the original dose (50% of the 20% of the delivered medi&#173;cation), remains 4 minutes &#173;after instillation, and only 17%, or 3.4% of the original dose, remains &#173;after 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="sidebar--text-no-indent- ParaOverride-13"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" src="Operator_BCSC2019_S02_C15_p347_368_2P-web-resources/image/3.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text">Some &#173;simple mea&#173;sures have been shown to improve ocular absorption of materials that do not traverse the cornea rapidly:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">Patients using more than 1 topical ocular medi&#173;cation should be instructed to allow 5 minutes between instillation of drops; other&#173;wise, the second drop may simply wash out the first.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">Blinking also diminishes a drug’s effect by activating the nasolacrimal pump mechanism, forcing fluid from the lacrimal sac into the nasopharynx, and creating a negative sac pressure that empties the tear lake (see BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="bullet-list_italic">Oculofacial Plastic and Orbital Surgery</span>). Patients can circumvent this loss of drug reservoir &#173;either by compressing the nasolacrimal duct through application of digital pressure at the medial canthus or by closing their eyes for 5 minutes &#173;after instillation of each drop. &#173;These 2 mea&#173;sures &#173;will prevent emptying of the tear lake and &#173;will reduce systemic toxicity by decreasing absorption through the nasal mucosa. Nasolacrimal occlusion &#173;will increase the absorption of topically applied materials and decrease systemic absorption and potential toxicity (Fig&#160;15-2).</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">Tear reservoir retention and drug contact time can also be extended &#173;either by increasing the viscosity of the vehicle or by using drug delivery objects such as contact lenses, collagen shields, and inserts.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Topical medi&#173;cations that are absorbed by the nasal mucosa can attain significant levels in the blood. One or 2 drops of a topical medi&#173;cation may provide a significant systemic dose of that drug. For example, a 1% solution of atropine has 1&#160;g/100&#160;mL, or 10&#160;mg/1&#160;mL. A simpler way of remembering this conversion is to add a 0 to the drug percentage to change the value to milligrams per milliliter. As &#173;there are 20 drops per milliliter (up to 40 in some newer, small-&#173;tip dispensers), &#173;there is <span class="frac">¼</span>–&#173;<span class="frac">½</span>&#160;mg of 1% atropine per drop. If this drop is given bilaterally, up to 1&#160;mg of active agent is available for systemic absorption, although the &#173;actual amount absorbed is &#173;limited by dilution and the washout effect of tears (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;15-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3">Absorption of topical agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because the contact time of topical medi&#173;cation is short, the rate of transfer from the tear fluid into the cornea is crucial. The corneal epithelium and endothelium have tight junctions that limit paracellular passage of molecules. To enter the anterior segment, topically applied medi&#173;cation must first pass through hydrophobic/lipophilic cell membranes in the corneal epithelium, then through the hydrophilic/lipophobic stroma, and fi&#173;nally through the hydrophobic/lipophilic cell membranes in the endothelium. Thus, topical ophthalmic drug formulations must be both lipophilic and hydrophilic. As nonionic particles are more lipophilic than ionic particles are, they pass through the cellular phospholipid membranes more readily. The pH of the medi&#173;cation can be manipulated to adjust the percentage of the drug that is in the ionized form and the nonionized form to optimize the rate of drug penetration. Mechanical disruption of the epithelial barrier in corneal abrasion or infection also increases the rate of intraocular drug penetration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Similar considerations apply to the conjunctiva. However, the permeability of the conjunctiva to small water-&#173;soluble molecules is thought to be 20 times that of the cornea. Perilimbal conjunctiva thus offers an effective transscleral route for delivery of drugs to anterior segment structures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The &#173;factors determining the amount of medi&#173;cation that can penetrate the cornea are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">concentration and solubility in the delivery vehicle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">viscosity</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">lipid solubility</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">pH</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ionic and steric forms</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">molecular size</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">chemical structure and configuration</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">vehicle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">surfactants (also called <span class="bullet-list_italic">surface-&#173;active agents</span>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition, reflex tearing and the binding of the active medi&#173;cation to proteins in tears and tissue affect drug bioavailability. Many preservatives used in topical drops are surfactants that can alter the barrier effect of the corneal epithelium and increase drug permeability.</p>
			<p class="h3">Drug concentration and solubility</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In order for a sufficient amount of a drug to pass through the corneal barriers, it may be necessary to load the tear reservoir with concentrated solutions (eg, by selecting pilocarpine, 4%, instead of pilocarpine, 1%). A practical limit to exploiting &#173;these high concentrations is reached when the high tonicity of the resulting solutions elicits reflex tearing or when drugs that are poorly water-&#173;soluble reach their solubility limits and precipitate. A drug with adequate solubility in an aqueous solution can be formulated as a solution, whereas a drug with poor solubility may need to be provided in a suspension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">suspension</span> is a mixture of a substance with poor solubility and a dispersion medium in which the substance is evenly distributed. A suspension requires agitation so that the active medi&#173;cation is redistributed before administration. Suspensions may be more irritating to the ocular surface than solutions are, a &#173;factor that may affect the choice of drug formulation. Prednisolone acetate and brinzolamide are 2 examples of a topical suspension.</p>
			<p class="body-text">An <span class="italic">emulsion</span> is similar to a suspension in that it is also a mixture of 2 components; however, the components are immiscible (not susceptible to being mixed) liquids. External force or an emulsifying agent is required to maintain the stability of the emulsion. Compared with solutions, emulsions have the advantages of increased contact time (because of the adsorption of nanodroplets on the corneal surface) and greater bioavailability. An emulsion typically has a cloudy appearance, but in contrast with a suspension, shaking the container before instillation is not necessary. Since emulsions are more viscous than solutions, patients may experience a foreign-&#173;body sensation &#173;after instillation. Difluprednate and cyclosporine are examples of a topical emulsion.</p>
			<p class="sidebar--text-no-indent- ParaOverride-14"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="Operator_BCSC2019_S02_C15_p347_368_2P-web-resources/image/4.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="h3"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-5" src="Operator_BCSC2019_S02_C15_p347_368_2P-web-resources/image/5.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-15">Viscosity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The addition of high-&#173;viscosity substances such as methylcellulose and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to a drug increases drug retention in the inferior cul-&#173;de-&#173;sac, aiding drug penetration. An example is timolol maleate formulated in gellan gum or xanthan gum, both of which are a high-&#173;molecular-&#173;weight, water-&#173;soluble, anionic polysaccharide that thickens on contact with the tear film, maintaining therapeutic levels and allowing the dosing to be decreased to once daily.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Improvement in ocular drug delivery is observed when drug viscosity is in the range of 1–15 cP (1 cP <span class="symbol">=</span> 1 millipascal-&#173;second [mPas]); the optimal viscosity is 12–15 cP. Increases in viscosity above this level do not appear to proportionally increase the drug concentration in aqueous. In fact, formulations with higher levels of viscosity cause ocular surface irritation, resulting in reflex blinking, lacrimation, and increased drainage of the applied formulation. They may also inhibit product–&#173;tear mixing and distort the ocular surface. Products with viscosity levels that are too high may impart a sticky feeling, cause blurring of vision, and be uncomfortable for patients to use.</p>
			<p class="h3">Lipid solubility</p>
			<p class="sidebar--text-no-indent- ParaOverride-16"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" src="Operator_BCSC2019_S02_C15_p347_368_2P-web-resources/image/6.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Studies of the permeability of isolated corneas to families of chemical compounds show that lipid solubility is more impor&#173;tant than &#173;water solubility in promoting penetration. To determine the solubility of a drug or group of drugs, researchers ascertain the ratio of lipid solubility to &#173;water solubility for each compound in the series by (1) mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the phase separation of a drug between 2 solvents—1 lipid-&#173;soluble and 1 water-&#173;soluble (eg, octanol and &#173;water); and (2) calculating the ratio of the drug concentration in the 2 compartments (partition coefficient). Drugs with greater relative lipid solubility have a higher partition coefficient. For example, the permeability coefficient is 70 times higher for substituted ethoxzolamides with high lipid solubility than for &#173;those of low lipid solubility. Drugs with higher levels of lipid solubility and higher partition coefficients have increased penetration of cell membranes. Compared with the parent molecules, prodrugs, such as vari&#173;ous prostaglandin analogues, with ester or amide moieties achieve lipophilicity that is 2-fold to 3-fold higher and in vitro corneal permeability that is enhanced 25-&#173; to 40-&#173;fold. However, compounds with excessively high partition coefficients are often poorly soluble in tears. Experimental studies of substituted compounds must account for the effects of the substituents on potency, solubility, and the permeability coefficient.</p>
			<p class="h3">pH and ionic charge</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many eye medi&#173;cations are alkaloids, or weak bases, and are most stable at an acidic pH. The buffer system used should have a capacity adequate to maintain pH within the stability range for the duration of the product shelf life. The pH range that a patient can tolerate is narrow. A large difference between the pH of a topical solution and that of tears may result in ocular irritation and stimulate reflex tearing that dilutes or washes away the topical drops. Thus, the buffer capacity should be adequate for stability but minimized to allow the overall pH of the tear fluid to be disrupted only momentarily upon instillation. Drugs such as tropicamide, cyclopentolate, atropine, and epinephrine exist in both charged and uncharged forms at the slightly alkaline pH of tears (pH 7.4). The partition coefficients, and therefore drug penetration, can be increased by raising the pH of the &#173;water phase, thereby increasing the proportion of drug molecules in the more lipid-&#173;soluble, uncharged form.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Surfactants</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many preservatives used in topical drops to prevent bacterial contamination are surfactants (also called <span class="italic">surface-&#173;active agents</span>) that alter cell membranes in the cornea as well as in bacteria, reducing the barrier effect of the corneal epithelium and increasing drug penetration. For example, a 0.1% carbachol solution containing 0.03% benzalkonium chloride can elicit the same miotic response as a 2% solution without this preservative.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Reflex tearing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular irritation and secondary tearing wash out the drug reservoir in the tear lake and reduce the contact time of the drug with the cornea. Reflex tearing occurs when topical medi&#173;cations are not isotonic and when they have a nonphysiologic pH or contain irritants.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Binding of medi&#173;cation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tear and ocular surface proteins, as well as ocular melanin, may bind topical or systemic medi&#173;cation, making the drug unavailable or creating a slow-&#173;release reservoir. This binding may alter the lag time, or onset, of a medi&#173;cation as well as the peak effect and duration of action, and it can cause local toxicity that occurs &#173;after discontinuation of the medi&#173;cation. One example of this effect is the ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxicity that progresses even &#173;after discontinuation of the aminoquinoline antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The latter is also often used in the management of autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-18">Topical Administration: Ointments</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Another strategy for increasing the contact time of ocular medi&#173;cations is through the use of ointments. Commercial oil-&#173;based ointments usually consist of petrolatum and mineral oil. The mineral oil allows the ointment to melt at body temperature. Both ingredients are also effective lipid solvents. However, most water-&#173;soluble medi&#173;cations are insoluble in the ointment and are pre&#173;sent as microcrystals. Only &#173;those microcrystals on the surface of the ointment dissolve in the tears; the rest are trapped &#173;until the ointment melts. Such protracted, slow release may prevent the drug from reaching a therapeutic level in the tears. Only when the drug has high lipid solubility (which allows it to diffuse through the ointment) and some &#173;water solubility can it escape from the ointment into both the corneal epithelium and the tears. Fluorometholone, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline are examples of drugs that achieve higher aqueous levels when administered as ointment than as drops.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-15">Local Administration</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Periocular injections</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Injection of medi&#173;cation beneath the conjunctiva or the Tenon capsule allows drugs to bypass the conjunctival and corneal epithelial barriers and absorb passively down a concentration gradient across the sclera and into intraocular tissues (see Fig&#160;15-1). Subconjunctival, sub-&#173;Tenon, and retrobulbar injections all allow medi&#173;cations to reach therapeutic levels &#173;behind the lens–&#173;iris diaphragm. The Tenon capsule is a lipophilic barrier, and if a hydrophilic drug is injected into the sub-&#173;Tenon space, it can penetrate intraocular tissue more quickly than topical application can. This approach is especially useful for drugs with low lipid solubility (such as penicillin), which do not penetrate the eye adequately when given topically. Subconjunctival injections create a reservoir of drug that can be slowly released into the tear film.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Injections can also be helpful in delivering medi&#173;cation closer to the local site of action—&#173;for example, posterior sub-&#173;Tenon injections of ste&#173;roids for cystoid macular edema (CME) or subconjunctival injection of fluorouracil (5-&#173;FU) &#173;after trabeculectomy. Retrobulbar and peribulbar injections also act directly at the site of delivery. &#173;These techniques are typically used for delivery of ophthalmic anesthesia and are covered in BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract.</span> Other examples of local, injectable medi&#173;cations are botulinum toxin, used in the treatment of benign essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm, as well as for strabismus; and retrobulbar alcohol, used as therapy for chronic pain in blind eyes. See BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma,</span> for further discussion of local application of antifibrotic agents in filtering surgery.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-4">Intraocular medi&#173;cations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intraocular injection of drugs instantly delivers effective concentrations at the target site. Although this route of administration may reduce systemic adverse effects, ocular adverse effects, which can include transient ocular hypertension and inflammation/infection, may be more pronounced. Clinicians must take &#173;great care to avoid the use of preserved medi&#173;cations and to control the concentration of intraocular drugs so that the delicate internal structures of the eye are protected from toxicity. Also, clinicians should strictly adhere to standard aseptic technique for the preparation and injection of intraocular medi&#173;cation so that infection is prevented. &#173;There are 2 types of intraocular injections: intracameral, or injection into the anterior chamber; and intravitreal, or injection into the vitreous cavity. Examples of substances and medi&#173;cations delivered via intraocular routes are presented in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;15-1</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intracameral injection of an antibiotic, administered at the end of cataract surgery to prevent endophthalmitis, has been reported. &#173;These injections have the advantage of reducing the need for postoperative dosing of medi&#173;cations. Cefuroxime, a broad-&#173;spectrum cephalosporin, is commonly used for this purpose. However, single-&#173;dose solution of cefuroxime is unavailable in the United States, and strict aseptic compounding protocol for reconstitution and dilution needs to be followed. Vancomycin is effective against methicillin-&#173;resistant <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> (MRSA) but also needs to be diluted before injection. Further, the theoretical risk of inducing drug re&#173;sis&#173;tance with indiscriminate use of vancomycin is a concern. Another option is diluting preservative-&#173;free topical moxifloxacin—&#173;a broad-&#173;spectrum, fourth-&#173;generation fluoroquinolone—&#173;for intracameral use. It is impor&#173;tant that antibiotic solutions prepared for intracameral injection be &#173;free of preservatives or other additives. Cases of toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) have been reported &#173;after the use of antibiotics with preservatives or with dosing errors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A regulated, compounded preservative-&#173;free formulation of triamcinolone acetonide 15&#160;mg/mL, moxifloxacin hydrochloride 1&#160;mg/mL, and vancomycin 10&#160;mg/mL is available for administration into the anterior vitreous &#173;after intraocular lens implantation through the zonule via the ciliary sulcus. Controlled studies on the safety and efficacy of this formulation are lacking. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received an adverse event report concerning a patient in whom bilateral hemorrhagic occlusive ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis (HORV) developed &#173;after this formulation was administered in each eye at the conclusion of cataract surgery procedures performed 2 weeks apart. HORV is a rare but potentially blinding complication that has occurred in patients who received intraocular injections of vancomycin formulations at the end of other&#173;wise uncomplicated cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intravitreal injection is the most common form of intraocular drug delivery. &#173;These injections are most often used to manage patients with complications of diabetic retinopathy (diabetic macular edema) and age-&#173;related macular degeneration (choroidal neovascularization). They are also used in the treatment of uveitis, endophthalmitis, and other conditions. For example, for ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular diseases, vari&#173;ous agents are available that target vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF). Intravitreal delivery can result in a relevant systemic concentration, as evidenced by the effects noted in fellow eyes in clinical &#173;trials. For discussion of individual agents used for intravitreal injection, see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span> in this volume and BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous.</span></p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-20">Systemic Administration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Just as the tight junctions of the corneal epithelium and endothelium limit anterior access to the interior of the eye, similar barriers limit access through vascular channels. The vascular endothelium of the ret&#173;ina, like that of the brain, is nonfenestrated and knitted together by tight junctions. Although both the choroid and the ciliary body have fenestrated vascular endothelia, the choroid is effectively sequestered by the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (tight junctions); and the ciliary body, by its nonpigmented epithelium (tight junctions).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Compared with medi&#173;cations with lower lipid solubility, drugs with higher lipid solubility more readily penetrate the blood–&#173;ocular barrier. Thus, chloramphenicol, which is highly lipid-&#173;soluble, penetrates 20 times better than does penicillin, which has poor lipid solubility.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ability of systemically administered drugs to gain access to the eye is also influenced by the degree to which they are bound to plasma proteins. Only the unbound form can cross the blood–&#173;ocular barrier. Sulfonamides are lipid-&#173;soluble but penetrate poorly &#173;because, at therapeutic levels, more than 90% of the medi&#173;cation is bound to plasma proteins. Similarly, compared with methicillin, oxacillin has reduced penetration &#173;because of its increased binding of plasma protein. &#173;Because bolus administration of a drug exceeds the binding capacity of plasma proteins and leads to higher intraocular drug levels than can be achieved by a slow intravenous drip, this approach is used for the administration of antibiotics in order to attain high peak intraocular levels.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Sustained-&#173;release oral preparations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The practical value of sustained-&#173;release preparations is substantial. For example, a single dose of acetazolamide &#173;will reduce intraocular pressure for up to 10 hours, whereas a single dose of sustained-&#173;release acetazolamide &#173;will produce a comparable effect that lasts 20 hours. A sustained-&#173;release medi&#173;cation offers a steadier blood level of the drug, avoiding marked peak concentrations and low concentrations, and reduces the frequency of administration.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Intravenous injections</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intravenously injected agents can be administered for diagnostic effect. Sodium fluorescein and indocyanine green are 2 agents used for ret&#173;i&#173;nal angiography to aid in the diagnosis of ret&#173;i&#173;nal and choroidal diseases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intravenous agents are also used therapeutically in ophthalmology. Although intravitreal injections have replaced intravenous therapy for postoperative endophthalmitis, continuous intravenous administration of an antibiotic is an effective way of maintaining therapeutic intraocular levels in endogenous infection (see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The barriers and reservoir effects of the eye affect the pharmacodynamics of antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin. &#173;When given as a single intravenous bolus, each of these drugs penetrate the eye with a higher initial intraocular level than when given by continuous infusion and maintain comparable bioavailability for 4 hours. The intraocular penetration of a drug may be better in the inflamed eye than in the healthy eye &#173;because of the disruption of the blood–&#173;aqueous and blood–&#173;retina barriers that occurs with inflammation. This disruption is demonstrated by the leakage of fluorescein from inflamed ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels into the vitreous during angiography.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Studies in rabbit eyes found that the bioavailability of intravenous ampicillin, tetracycline, and dexamethasone differed in vari&#173;ous structures of the rabbit eye, with the highest levels of &#173;these medi&#173;cations found in the sclera and conjunctiva, followed by the iris and ciliary body, and fi&#173;nally the cornea, aqueous humor, choroid, and ret&#173;ina. Very low levels appeared in the lens and vitreous. No marked differences in vascular distribution of the drugs was shown, however. The tissue bioavailability is determined by the vascularity of the tissue and the barriers existing between the blood and that tissue.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Intramuscular injections</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In ophthalmology, intramuscular injection of drugs is used less frequently than topical, oral, or intravenous administration of medi&#173;cations. Notable exceptions include intramuscular injection of prostigmine in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis and botulinum toxin, given for local effect, in facial dystonias and in some cases of strabismus.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-21">Ocular Drug Design and Methods of Delivery</p>
			<div id="Chapt15_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">New ocular drugs are designed with a focus on specificity of action and safety, with delivery systems aimed at improving con&#173;ve&#173;nience and therefore patient compliance. Each of the following approaches responds to a specific prob&#173;lem in ocular pharmacokinetics.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-22">Prodrugs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ophthalmic prodrugs are therapeutically inactive derivatives of drug molecules that are designed to be activated by enzymatic systems within the eye in order to improve ocular penetration. &#173;These derivatives are usually synthesized by conjugation of a specific promoiety to the parent drug via ester or amide. The ester and amide ophthalmic prodrugs are hydrolyzed by esterase and amidases to the active molecules as they permeate through the cornea or conjunctiva. Permeability across the cornea is also improved by the increased lipid solubility of the prodrug. Prostaglandin analogues are successful examples of this drug delivery strategy. Latanoprost, travoprost, and tafluprost are prostaglandin analogues that interact with the prostaglandin FP receptor. They require hydrolyzation prior to becoming active compounds in the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Valacyclovir hydrochloride is an antiviral prodrug that, when taken orally, is easily absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and quickly converted to the active form of acyclovir. Likewise, famciclovir is a prodrug of the active antiviral penciclovir.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-22">Sustained-&#173;Release Delivery</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Ocular inserts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyedrop therapy involves periodic delivery of relatively large quantities of a drug to overcome low ocular bioavailability due to vari&#173;ous &#173;factors, such as tearing and blinking, nasolacrimal drainage, conjunctival blood and lymph flow, metabolic degradation, and corneal and blood–&#173;aqueous barriers. The high peak drug levels attained with bolus dosing can cause local and systemic side effects, such as induced accommodation producing brow ache, which can occur &#173;after pilocarpine use. In addition, drug concentration in the eye can vary significantly &#173;because of variations in application technique and patient adherence to dosing amounts and schedules. Thus, &#173;there is a need for an efficient delivery system that can provide controlled release of a drug with a reduced dosing frequency.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Devices have been developed that deliver an adequate supply of medi&#173;cation at a steady-&#173;state level, achieving beneficial effects with fewer adverse effects. In the 1970s, the first steady-&#173;state drug delivery system, a nonbiodegradable insert designed to deliver pilocarpine at a steady rate of 40 μg/hr, became available. This device was discontinued as the use of pilocarpine decreased. Ocular inserts currently in development or &#173;under investigation are cylindrical in shape and are placed in the fornix for prolonged drug release. They can be categorized as soluble or insoluble:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-23"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Soluble</span> inserts release the drug via interaction between the polymeric matrix of the device and the tear film. Removal of &#173;these inserts is unnecessary.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-24"><span class="bullet-list_italic">Insoluble</span> inserts may achieve a more constant rate of drug release than soluble inserts, but removal of the device is required.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular inserts have the advantages of prolonged and steady delivery of drugs, which can improve patient compliance. However, they have the potential for patient discomfort such as foreign-&#173;body sensation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Implants</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">To circumvent the repeated injections that are required with intraocular injection of a drug, vari&#173;ous implantable devices &#173;were developed for sustained drug delivery. The first-&#173;available sustained-&#173;release implant was the ganciclovir intravitreal implant for treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. An ethylene vinyl acetate disc with a PVA coating served as the drug reservoir. The thickness of the PVA lid regulated the delivery of ganciclovir to the target tissue. &#173;After surgical implantation, the device delivered a steady source of ganciclovir for 5–8 months. The ganciclovir intravitreal implant was discontinued &#173;after the patent expired in 2015. Current intraocular sustained-&#173;release products approved by the FDA include 2 fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implants (0.59&#160;mg and 0.19&#160;mg) and a dexamethasone intravitreal implant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The 0.59-mg fluocinolone acetonide implant, a nonbiodegradable intraocular polymer implant requiring surgical placement in the pars plana region, is approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic noninfectious posterior uveitis. It was designed to release fluocinolone acetonide at a nominal initial rate of 0.6&#160;μg/d, decreasing over the first month to a steady state between 0.3 and 0.4&#160;μg/d over approximately 30 months.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The 0.19-mg fluocinolone implant, delivered by intravitreal injection, has a nonbioerodable tube of polyimide and a permeable membrane of PVA at one end that releases the medi&#173;cation. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of diabetic macular edema in patients who are not ste&#173;roid responders. The implant releases fluocinolone acetonide at an average rate of 0.2&#160;μg/d for 36 months.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The 0.7-mg dexamethasone implant is a biodegradable poly(lactic-&#173;<span class="italic">co</span>-&#173;glycolic acid) (PLGA) matrix loaded with dexamethasone for injection into the vitreous cavity. The polymer degrades to lactic acid and glycolic acid, and dexamethasone is slowly released within the vitreous cavity. The implant is indicated for the treatment of macular edema secondary to ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion, noninfectious posterior uveitis, and diabetic macular edema. Vari&#173;ous biodegradable and nonbiodegradable implants designed for sustained release of single or multiple medi&#173;cations are &#173;under development.</p>
			<p class="h3">Intraocular lenses and other sustained-&#173;release systems</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sustained-&#173;release systems that use biodegradable polymers entrapped with triamcinolone acetonide or antibiotics and are attached to the periphery or haptics of an artificial intraocular lens are &#173;under investigation to prevent intraocular infection and control postoperative intraocular inflammation. Other research efforts include development of an intraocular lens prepared with biomaterials that not only allow high transmittance at vis&#173;i&#173;ble wavelengths but also can be loaded with dexamethasone to achieve sustained release of this drug &#173;after cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intraocular sustained-&#173;release devices are being studied as alternatives to glaucoma medical therapy that has been shown to have poor patient compliance. Products &#173;under investigation include injectable sustained-&#173;release biodegradable implants through which vari&#173;ous hypotensive medi&#173;cations can be delivered into the anterior chamber or supraciliary space or beneath the conjunctiva to achieve a sustained reduction of intraocular pressure for months.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-17">Collagen Corneal Shields</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Collagen corneal shields are useful as a delivery system to prolong the contact between a drug and the cornea. For the creation of &#173;these shields, porcine scleral tissue is extracted and molded into contact lens–&#173;like shields. Drugs can be incorporated into the collagen matrix during the manufacturing pro&#173;cess, absorbed into the shield during rehydration, or applied topically while the shield is in the eye. &#173;Because the shield dissolves in 12, 24, or 72 hours, depending on the manufacturing pro&#173;cess for collagen crosslinking, the drug is released gradually into the tear film, and high concentrations are maintained on the corneal surface and in the conjunctival cul-&#173;de-&#173;sac.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Recent attempts to create collagen shields have focused on using metal oxide nanoparticles as agents for collagen crosslinking. In one study, an initial rapid release, or <span class="italic">burst </span><span class="italic">release,</span> due to adsorption of the drug on the shields, was followed by a constant release over the next 13 days, which was due to diffusion of the drug from the collagen matrix. Additional crosslinking with ultraviolet light achieved a slower rate of drug release.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Collagen shields have been used for the early management of bacterial keratitis, as well as for antibiotic prophylaxis. They have also been used to promote epithelial healing &#173;after ocular surgery, trauma, or spontaneous erosion. Despite &#173;these therapeutic benefits, collagen shields are poorly tolerated &#173;because they are very uncomfortable.</p>

			<p class="h3-h2">Contact lenses</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ongoing research approaches for contact lens (CL) drug delivery systems focus on improving the residence time of the drug at the surface of the eye to enhance bioavailability and to provide more con&#173;ve&#173;nient and efficacious therapy. Vari&#173;ous techniques are used to incorporate the drug into the CL body, including</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-26">soaking the CL in drug solution</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">incorporating monomers able to interact with target drugs into the CL hydrogels</li>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;These CL delivery systems need to be designed so that they also preserve the transparency required for vision and the oxygen permeability necessary for corneal health. One way to maintain transparency is by lathing the encapsulated drug-&#173;polymer film in the periphery of the CL hydrogel.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Punctal plug–&#173;mediated delivery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vari&#173;ous punctal plug–&#173;mediated drug delivery systems are currently &#173;under clinical investigation. The design of &#173;these delivery systems generally includes a cylindrical polymeric core loaded with the drug compound, an impermeable shell, and a cap (or head portion of the plug exposed to the tear film) with pores from which the drug is released by diffusion. Most examples of punctal plug systems show nearly constant drug-&#173;release rates for drug molecules. Delivery of drugs by punctal plug has several potential advantages over administration via eyedrops, including lack of exposure to preservatives, dose reduction, controlled release of the drug at an optimum rate, and improved patient compliance. Limitations include ocular irritation, itching, discomfort, increased lacrimation, and spontaneous extrusion of the plug.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Gel-&#173;forming drops</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Gel-&#173;forming drops use pentablock copolymers as a vehicle for topical drug delivery. The drug is added to a nonviscous polymer drop. &#173;After the drop is in contact with the surface of the eye, the drop reacts upon exposure to body temperature and transforms into a gel.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Encapsulated cell technology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Encapsulated cell technology has been applied to the delivery of therapeutic agents for treatment of ret&#173;i&#173;nal diseases. This technology involves encapsulation of cells within a semipermeable polymer capsule that secretes therapeutic material into the vitreous. The device is implanted in the vitreous cavity and secured to the sclera.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Liposomes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Liposomes are synthetic lipid microspheres that serve as multipurpose vehicles for the topical delivery of drugs, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic material, and cosmetics. They are produced when phospholipid molecules interact to form a bilayer lipid membrane in an aqueous environment. The interior of the bilayer consists of the hydrophobic fatty-&#173;acid tails of the phospholipid molecule, whereas the outer layer is composed of hydrophilic polar-&#173;head groups of the molecule. A water-&#173;soluble drug can be dissolved in the aqueous phase of the interior compartment; a hydrophobic drug can be intercalated into the lipid bilayer itself. However, the routine use of liposome formulation for topical ocular drug delivery is &#173;limited by the short shelf life of these products, their &#173;limited drug-&#173;loading capacity, and difficulty with stabilizing the preparation.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-17">Nanotechnology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nanotechnology has been increasingly applied in medi&#173;cation design to protect active molecules and provide sustained drug delivery. Methods for transporting hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs and genes include the use of biodegradable nanoparticles such as nanospheres, nanocapsules, and nanomicelles; the colloidal dispersion of nanoparticles as nanosuspension; and the use of nanoemulsion. &#173;These methods are modeled &#173;after the molecular structure of viruses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The physical pro&#173;cess of moving charged molecules by an electrical current is called <span class="italic">ion</span><span class="italic">tophoresis.</span> This procedure places a relatively high concentration of a drug locally, where it can achieve maximum benefit with &#173;little waste or systemic absorption. Animal studies have demonstrated that iontophoresis increases penetration of vari&#173;ous antibiotics and antiviral drugs across ocular surfaces into the cornea and the interior of the eye. However, patient discomfort, ocular tissue damage, and necrosis restrict the widespread use of this mode of drug delivery.</p>
			<p class="h3">Microelectromechanical systems</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Drug delivery devices based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are &#173;under investigation to provide antiangiogenic therapy for age-&#173;related macular degeneration and ste&#173;roid therapy for chronic uveitis. &#173;These devices are implanted in a manner similar to that used for current glaucoma tube shunts and deliver multiple microdoses of a drug directly into the vitreous cavity through a pars plana cannula. The device contains a drug reservoir with a refill port, a battery, electronics, and an electrolysis chamber to deliver the desired dose.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most drugs act by binding to and altering the function of regulatory macromolecules, usually neurotransmitter receptors, hormone receptors, or enzymes. Binding may be a reversible association mediated by electrostatic and/or van der Waals forces, or it may involve formation of a covalent intermediate.

In some cases, the drug’s clinical effect closely reflects the degree of receptor occupancy on a moment-&#173;to-&#173;moment basis. Such is usually the case for drugs that affect neural transmission or for drugs that are enzyme inhibitors. In contrast, some drug effects lag hours &#173;behind receptor occupancy or persist long &#173;after the drug is gone. Such is the case with many drugs acting on hormone receptors, &#173;because their effects are often mediated through a series of biochemical events.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to differences in timing of receptor occupancy and drug effects, the degree of receptor occupancy can differ considerably from the corresponding drug effect. For example, &#173;because the amount of carbonic anhydrase pre&#173;sent in the ciliary pro&#173;cesses is 100 times that required to support aqueous secretion, more than 99% of the enzyme must be inhibited before secretion is reduced. On the other hand, some maximal hormone responses occur at concentrations well below &#173;those required for receptor saturation, indicating the presence of “unbound receptors.”</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic polymorphisms in genes encoding drug-&#173;metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and receptors contribute, at least in part, to the wide interindividual variability in drug response and adverse drug reactions. <span class="italic">Pharmacoge&#173;ne&#173;tics</span> is the study of the influence of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variation on drug efficacy or toxicity, focusing on single genes. The term is often used interchangeably with <span class="italic">pharmacogenomics,</span> which is the study of how ge&#173;ne&#173;tic makeup affects an individual’s response to drugs; in other words, the focus is on many genes. Pharmacoge&#173;ne&#173;tics can be broadly divided into (1) the study of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variations that affect drug metabolism (pharmacokinetics); and (2) the study of ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variations that affect drug targets (<a href="http://www.discoverymedicine.com/category/medical-specialties/pharmacology/pharmacodynamics/">pharmacodynamics</a>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thus far, some small-&#173;scale studies have demonstrated an association between vari&#173;ous genotypes or haplotypes and response to drug therapies for 2 major eye disorders, age-&#173;related macular degeneration and glaucoma, but the results are conflicting. One example is the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes and the response to latanoprost, specifically, SNPs in the genes coding for matrix metalloproteinases and SNPs in the prostaglandin F2<span class="greek"></span> receptor gene <span class="italic">(PTGFR).</span> Another example is the pharmacoge&#173;ne&#173;tic relationship between polymorphisms in specific genes and the dif&#173;fer&#173;ent levels of drug efficacy in the treatment of exudative age-&#173;related macular degeneration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although translation of pharmacoge&#173;ne&#173;tic and pharmacogenomic data into clinical practice would provide significant opportunities to increase the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy, consensus (social, ethical, and eco&#173;nom&#173;ical) on issues such as ge&#173;ne&#173;tic discrimination needs to be reached and such issues addressed by regulatory agencies. Clinicians must be aware of the ethical, &#173;legal, and social issues associated with <a href="http://www.discoverymedicine.com/tag/genetic-testing/">ge&#173;ne&#173;tic testing</a>.</p>
