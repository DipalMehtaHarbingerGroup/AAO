			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Overview of RPE Structure</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The RPE is a monolayer of neuroectoderm-&#173;derived epithelial cells, located between the highly vascular choriocapillaris and the photoreceptor outer segments (<span class="xref-figure-local">Figs&#160;13-1, 13-2</span>). Embryologically, it is derived from the same neural anlage as the neurosensory ret&#173;ina. The ret&#173;ina and RPE develop as an invagination of the embryonic optic cup that folds the neuroectodermal layer into apex-&#173;to-&#173;apex contact with itself. The outer layer forms the RPE and the inner layer forms the neurosensory ret&#173;ina. The intervening area remains throughout life as a potential space and is the plane of separation for ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In &#173;humans, &#173;there are approximately 4–6 million RPE cells per eye. On the apical surface of RPE cells are long microvilli that interdigitate with the outer segments of photoreceptor cells (see Figs&#160;13-1, Fig&#160;13-2). &#173;These cells are joined near their apical side by tight junctions that establish polarity, block the passage of &#173;water and ions, and constitute the outer blood–&#173;retina barrier. The RPE basal surface, which is adjacent to the Bruch membrane (an extracellular matrix between the RPE and the choriocapillaris), has many infoldings that increase the surface area available for the exchange of solutes (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to the organelles found in most cells (eg, the nucleus, Golgi apparatus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria), RPE cells contain melanin granules and phagosomes, reflecting their role in light absorption and phagocytosis (discussed &#173;later in the chapter). The RPE is particularly rich in microperoxisomes, suggesting that it is active in detoxifying the large number of &#173;free radicals and oxidized lipids generated in this highly oxidative and light-&#173;rich environment.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Biochemical Composition</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Biochemically, the RPE is a dynamic and complex cell. It must meet demands for its own active metabolism, its extraordinary phagocytic function, and its role as a biological filter for the neurosensory ret&#173;ina. &#173;These pro&#173;cesses impose a very high energy requirement on the RPE; not surprisingly, RPE cells contain all the enzymes of the 3 major biochemical pathways: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Glucose is the primary carbon source used for energy metabolism and for conversion to protein. Although the RPE does make a minor contribution to the glycosaminoglycan-&#173; and proteoglycan-&#173;containing interphotoreceptor matrix, glucose is not converted to glycogen in the RPE.&#160;Glucosamine, fucose, galactose, and mannose are all metabolized to some extent in the RPE, although mannose seems to be passed on almost directly to the photoreceptors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">More than 80% of the wet weight of the RPE is contributed by &#173;water. Proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids contribute most of the remaining weight.</p>
			<p class="h2">Proteins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nearly 850 proteins have been identified in the RPE. Many proteins found in other cells are also pre&#173;sent in the RPE. &#173;These include hydrolytic enzymes such as glutathione, peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase, which are impor&#173;tant for detoxification. The cytoskeletal proteins actin, myosin, <span class="greek">α</span>-&#173;actinin, fodrin, and vinculin are also pre&#173;sent in both the RPE and other cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some proteins found in the RPE and other cells are localized differently in the RPE. A well-&#173;known example of such a protein is Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase (also called <span class="italic">sodium-&#173;potassium pump</span>), which has a unique location in RPE cells. In most polarized epithelial cells, Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase is localized to the basolateral membrane, but in the RPE this enzyme is found on the apical membrane. The sodium-&#173;potassium pump uses energy derived from adeno&#173;sine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to transport sodium (Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>) and potassium (K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>) against their electrochemical gradients. It is thought that the apical location of Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase in the RPE maintains the balance of Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> and K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space. RPE cells also contain proteins whose polarity has been shown to be reversed compared with the polarity of other epithelial cells; examples include an isoform of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM-140) and folate receptor <span class="greek">α</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some proteins are expressed only in the RPE. One such protein, RPE-&#173;specific protein 65&#160;kDa (RPE65), is an obligate component of the isomerization and hydrolysis of vitamin A, which is required for regeneration of visual pigment (described &#173;later in Vitamin A Regeneration).</p>
			<p class="h2">Lipids</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lipids account for approximately 3% of the wet weight of the RPE; about half are phospholipids. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine make up more than 80% of the total phospholipid content. In general, levels of saturated fatty acids are higher in the RPE than in the adjacent outer segments. The saturated fatty acids palmitic acid and stearic acid are used for retinol esterification and for energy metabolism by the RPE mitochondria. The level of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, n–3), is much lower in the RPE than in the outer segments, although the level of arachidonic acid is relatively high. A number of studies have suggested that the ret&#173;ina may be spared the effects of essential fatty acid deficiency &#173;because the RPE efficiently sequesters fatty acids from the blood. The RPE actively conserves and efficiently reuses fatty acids, thus preventing their loss as waste products.</p>
			<p class="h2">Nucleic Acids</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">RNA is synthesized continually by the RPE. This is required to produce the numerous enzymes that are necessary for cell metabolism, phagocytosis of shed discs, and maintenance of the retinoid pathway and transport functions.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Major Physiologic Roles of the RPE</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The RPE has a number of physiologic roles (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-3</span>). Crucial among &#173;these functions are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">vitamin A regeneration, which is integral to sustaining vision</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer-&#173;segment discs</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">biological filter for the neurosensory ret&#173;ina through transport of necessary nutrients and ions to photoreceptor cells and removal of waste products from photoreceptors</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">absorption of scattered and out-&#173;of-&#173;focus light via pigmentation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">adhesion of the ret&#173;ina</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">secretion of humoral and growth &#173;factors</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;These functions are discussed briefly in the following sections. Other impor&#173;tant functions subserved by the RPE include its role in synthesis and remodeling of the interphotoreceptor matrix, formation of the outer blood–&#173;retina barrier, and formation of the basal lamina of Bruch membrane.</p>
			<p class="h2">Vitamin A&#160;Regeneration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The&#160;RPE, second only to the liver in its concentration of vitamin A, plays a major role in the uptake, storage, and mobilization of vitamin A. The RPE supplies the photoreceptor outer segments with vitamin A, which is tethered to rhodopsin in rods and to the 3 different cone opsins (red, green, and blue). Although the dif&#173;fer&#173;ent opsins have specific absorption spectra, vitamin A changes its configuration identically in response to the par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar wavelength of light (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The basic function of the RPE cell is to generate 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis-&#173;</span>retinal (also called 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis-</span>retinaldehyde) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-4</span>). Light-&#173;induced activation of rhodopsin leads to isomerization of 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis</span>-&#173;retinal to all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinal and initiates the phototransduction cascade. Light-&#173;activated rhodopsin releases all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinal and must bind with another 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis-&#173;</span>retinal to be ready for activation by the next photon of light. The &#173;free all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinal isomer undergoes a series of enzymatic reactions, called the <span class="italic">visual cycle</span> or <span class="italic">retinoid cycle,</span> to regenerate 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis-&#173;</span>retinal. The visual cycle ensures a steady supply of 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis</span>-&#173;retinal for the opsins for maintaining vision and requires close interaction between the RPE and photoreceptor outer segments. Similar pro&#173;cesses occur in all photoreceptors; the pro&#173;cess specific to rods is discussed below.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Free all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinal is cleared from the rod discs by ABCA4, an ATP-&#173;binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein. &#173;After transport from the rod discs to the cytosol of the outer segments, all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinal is enzymatically reduced to all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinol by retinol dehydrogenase. All-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinol is rapidly released by photoreceptor cells to the interphotoreceptor matrix, where it binds to interphotoreceptor retinoid-&#173;binding protein (IRBP). RPE cells contain cellular retinol-&#173;binding protein 1 (CRBP1), which promotes the uptake of all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans</span>-&#173;retinol into the RPE. The RPE also obtains vitamin A from the blood, where it is complexed with retinol-&#173;binding protein (RBP) and transthyretin. Phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer-&#173;segment discs (see the following section) by the RPE also allows recycling of vitamin A.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Within the RPE cells, CRBP1-&#173;bound all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinol is enzymatically esterified by lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT). The resultant retinyl ester is hydrolyzed and isomerized to the 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis</span> configuration by the retinoid isomerohydrolase RPE65. 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis</span>-&#173;Retinol is then oxidized to 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis-&#173;</span>retinal by 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis-&#173;</span>retinol dehydrogenase. The newly formed 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis-&#173;</span>retinal is released from RPE cells to the interphotoreceptor matrix. From &#173;there it is transported by IRBP (IRBP binds both retinol and ret&#173;i&#173;nal forms) to the photoreceptor outer-&#173;segment discs to generate another visual transduction cycle.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Phagocytosis of Shed Photoreceptor Outer-&#173;Segment Discs</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The RPE plays a crucial role in turnover of the photosensitive membrane of rod and cone photoreceptors (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-5</span>). Each photoreceptor cell sheds approximately 100 outer-&#173;segment discs per day. &#173;Because many photoreceptors interdigitate with a single RPE cell, each RPE cell ingests and digests more than 4000 discs daily. The shedding event follows a circadian rhythm: in rods, shedding is most vigorous at dawn; in cones, shedding occurs most vigorously at dusk.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The shed outer-&#173;segment discs are encapsulated in phagosomes (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;13-5C</span>; see also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span>, <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-45</span>), which in turn fuse with lysosomes and are digested. During degradation of the discs, building blocks are recycled into photoreceptors for use in the synthesis and assembly of new discs. The lipofuscin characteristic of the RPE is derived from the photosensitive membranes and is responsible for generating the signal detected in fundus autofluorescence imaging (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;13-6</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">As detailed &#173;earlier in the chapter, phototransduction &#173;causes release of &#173;free all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinal, which is transported from the outer-&#173;segment discs into the outer-&#173;segment cytosol by ABCA4. In certain disease states (eg, Stargardt disease), the &#173;free all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinal is not readily cleared from the outer-&#173;segment discs by ABCA4. The excess all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans</span>-&#173;retinal&#160;combines with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the disc lipid bilayer, forming <span class="italic">N</span>-&#173;retinylidene-&#173;PE (<span class="italic">N</span>-&#173;ret-&#173;PE). Elevated&#160;<span class="italic">N</span>-&#173;ret-&#173;PE and all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinal undergo a secondary nonenzymatic condensation in the outer segments to yield A2PE-&#173;H2. The distal outer segments containing A2PE-&#173;H2 and elevated all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinal and <span class="italic">N</span>-&#173;ret-&#173;PE are phagocytosed by the RPE as part&#160;of the normal disc-&#173;renewal pro&#173;cess, but the RPE is unable to fully degrade the nonphysiologic load. This leads to the accumulation of toxic ret&#173;i&#173;nal fluorophores like A2E (derived from A2PE-&#173;H2), which damage the RPE.</p>
			<p class="h2">Transport</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The health and integrity of ret&#173;i&#173;nal neurons depend on a well-&#173;regulated extracellular environment. A crucial function of the RPE that contributes to this regulation is control of the volume and composition of fluid in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space through transport of ions, fluid, and metabolites. The distribution of transport proteins residing in the apical and basolateral membrane domains of the cell is asymmetric, and this allows the epithelium to carry out vectorial transport. The membrane proteins remain in their proper location &#173;because of tight junction proteins. The polarity of the cell is maintained &#173;because of the intracellular molecular machinery that synthesizes new proteins and delivers them preferentially to the apical or basolateral cell membranes. Cytoskeletal proteins are fundamental in determining cell polarity and regulating transport.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The aqueous environment of the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space is actively maintained by the ion-&#173;transport systems of the RPE, which regulate transport of a variety of ions (K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>, Ca<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>, Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>, Cl<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">–&#173;</span>, and HCO<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">3</span><span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">–&#173;</span>). This transport is vectorial in most cases; for example, Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> is actively transported from the choriocapillaris &#173;toward the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space, whereas K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> is transported in the opposite direction. The apical membrane of the RPE appears to be the major locus of this transport. As mentioned previously, ouabain-&#173;sensitive Na<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase is pre&#173;s&#173;ent at the apical, but not the basal, side. Similarly, an active bicarbonate-&#173;transport system appears to be located in the apical RPE membrane. High carbonic anhydrase activity seems to be associated with both the apical and basal sides of the cell.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Net ionic fluxes in the RPE are responsible for the transepithelial electrical potential that can be mea&#173;sured across the RPE apical membrane—&#173;a potential that is rapidly modified in the presence of a variety of metabolic inhibitors (eg, ouabain and dinitrophenol). Ion gradients across the RPE drive the transport of &#173;water from the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space to the choriocapillaris. The RPE also transports lactic acid produced by metabolic activity in the ret&#173;ina away from the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space. Active vectorial transport systems for other ret&#173;i&#173;nal metabolites (eg, taurine, methionine, and folate) have also been demonstrated. The&#160;RPE, therefore, appears to be impor&#173;tant for maintaining the ionic environment of the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space, which in turn is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the RPE–&#173;photoreceptor interface. The trans-&#173;RPE potential is the basis for the electro-&#173;oculogram (EOG), which is the most common electrophysiologic test for evaluating the RPE (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span>, <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-8</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Pigmentation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A characteristic feature of the RPE is the presence of melanin pigment. Pigment granules are abundant in the cytoplasm of adult RPE cells, predominantly in the apical and midportions of the cell (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;13-5B</span>). During development, activation of the tyrosinase promoter triggers the onset of melanogenesis in this cell and marks the commitment of the neuroectoderm to become RPE. Although most melanogenesis occurs before birth, melanin production in the RPE occurs throughout life, albeit at a slow rate. As &#173;humans age, the melanin granules fuse with lysosomes; thus, the fundus of an older person is less pigmented than that of a young person. Clinically, this is most evident in the peripheral fundus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The exact role of melanin within cells remains speculative. One universally recognized function of melanin is to act as a neutral-&#173;density filter in scattering light. In so &#173;doing, melanin may have a protective role. But even in the minimally pigmented fundus, visual acuity can be 20/20. Visual prob&#173;lems in persons with albinism are attributable to foveal hypoplasia, not optical scatter. When melanin levels are below a critical level, as in oculocutaneous albinism, &#173;there is aberrant neuronal migration in the visual pathway (more contralateral projections of ganglion cells), incomplete foveal development, low vision, nystagmus, and strabismus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Melanin is also a free-&#173;radical stabilizer and can bind many toxins and drugs (such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine). Some regard this feature as protective; &#173;others think that it contributes to tissue toxicity.</p>
			<p class="sidebar"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="BCSC2019_S02_C13_p321_p334_9P-web-resources/image/2.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="h2">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Adhesion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The subret&#173;i&#173;nal space is never bridged by tissue, and yet the neural ret&#173;ina remains firmly attached to the RPE throughout life. The RPE is crucial to maintaining ret&#173;i&#173;nal adhesion. Detachment of the photoreceptors from the RPE can lead to permanent morphologic and functional changes in the ret&#173;ina.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Numerous &#173;factors keep the ret&#173;ina in place. &#173;These include passive hydrostatic forces, interdigitation of outer segments and RPE microvilli, active transport of subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid, and the complex structure of the interphotoreceptor matrix and its binding properties (van der Waals forces). In pathologic conditions, ret&#173;i&#173;nal adhesion can diminish, and detachment of the ret&#173;ina occurs. Detachment does not occur simply &#173;because &#173;there is a hole in the ret&#173;ina or a leak in the RPE; &#173;there must be &#173;either positive traction pulling the neural ret&#173;ina or positive forces pushing fluid into the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space that overwhelms the removal capacity of the RPE.</p>
			<p class="sidebar"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-3" src="BCSC2019_S02_C13_p321_p334_9P-web-resources/image/3.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="h2">Secretion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A number of growth &#173;factors, cytokines, and immune modulators are secreted by the RPE and are essential for maintaining the physiologic function of the photoreceptors and the choriocapillaris. Examples include PEDF (pigment epithelium–&#173;derived &#173;factor) and CNTF (ciliary neurotrophic &#173;factor), which prevent photoreceptor cell death; VEGF (vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor), which maintains choroidal vascular endothelium; and TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases), which maintains the extracellular matrix.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">The Role of Autophagy in the RPE</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Autophagy</span> is a normal homeostatic mechanism whereby the cell degrades its own damaged components and recycles the degradation products for continued cell survival. In RPE cells, autophagic machinery, which includes phagosomes and lysosomes, is abundant. Autophagy is essential to the RPE for management of phagocytosed outer segments and for turnover of its own components. &#173;Because RPE cells do not divide &#173;under normal conditions, autophagy is also impor&#173;tant for quality control of intracellular components. Dysregulated autophagy is involved in the pathophysiology of diseases such as age-&#173;related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and photoreceptor loss in ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Drugs that inhibit autophagy (eg, chloroquine) lead to RPE and photoreceptor damage.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">The RPE in Disease</p>
			<div id="Chapt13_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The RPE is vital for normal visual function. Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic defects unique to the RPE may produce ret&#173;i&#173;nal degenerations and disorders. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;13-1</span> pre&#173;sents some of &#173;these conditions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">RPE cells have been found to play a role in nonge&#173;ne&#173;tic ophthalmic conditions as well. Defects in the pump mechanism of the RPE have been proposed as the cause of central serous chorioretinopathy. In certain pathologic conditions, RPE cells, which normally do not divide, detach from the basement membrane and become migratory. On contact with the vitreous and/or transforming growth &#173;factor <span class="greek">β</span> (TGF-&#173;<span class="greek">β</span>), &#173;these cells undergo metaplasia, acquiring myofibroblast qualities. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is an example of such a condition. In&#160;PVR, the metaplastic RPE cells form contractile membranes on the surface of the ret&#173;ina, leading to ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment.

Then, all-&#173;<span class="figure-caption_italic">trans-&#173;</span>retinol is delivered to the RPE via interphotoreceptor retinoid-&#173;binding protein (IRBP), which acts as a shut&#173;tle and also shields the cell membranes from the membranolytic retinoid molecules.
