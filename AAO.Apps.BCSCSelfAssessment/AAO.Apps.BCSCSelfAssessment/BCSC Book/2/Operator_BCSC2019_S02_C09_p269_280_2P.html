			<p class="h1">Physiology of the Iris and Ciliary Body</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The iris and ciliary body are the anterior parts of the uvea (also called <span class="italic">uveal tract</span>), which is continuous with the choroid posteriorly. The iris is a highly pigmented tissue that functions as a movable diaphragm between the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye to regulate the amount of light that reaches the ret&#173;ina. It is a delicate, dynamic structure that can make precise and rapid changes in pupillary dia&#173;meter in response to light and specific pharmacologic stimuli. The ciliary body produces the aqueous humor, regulates its composition, and contributes to uveoscleral outflow, thereby directly influencing the ionic environment and metabolism of the cornea, lens, and trabecular meshwork.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ciliary body is the main pharmacologic target in the treatment of glaucoma. Many of the agents used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma, such as adrenergic and cholinergic drugs and prostaglandin analogues, work through receptors and their respective signal transduction pathways. The iris–&#173;ciliary body is rich in many types of receptors that bind to vari&#173;ous ligands. Chapter&#160;16 discusses &#173;these receptors and pharmacologic agents relevant to the treatment of glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ciliary body is a major contributor to the defense against oxidative stress, via molecules secreted into the aqueous humor, as discussed &#173;later in this chapter. It has the highest concentration of redox (oxidation-&#173;reduction) enzymes in the anterior segment. The ciliary body also contains proteins of the cytochrome P450 &#173;family, though only a small number compared with the liver. &#173;These enzymes are involved in detoxification, whereby they convert hydrophobic compounds to hydrophilic ones via hydroxylation. CYP2D6 is one such enzyme that metabolizes timolol. It is expressed in low levels in ocular tissues but is abundant in the liver.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Dynamics of the Aqueous Humor</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top3">
			<p class="h2-h1">Blood–&#173;Aqueous Barrier</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The aqueous humor <span class="italic">(aqueous)</span> is a transparent fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. It is the major nutrient source for the avascular lens and cornea and also serves as a medium for removal of waste products.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular fluids are separated from blood by barriers formed by the tight junctions of epithelial cells and &#173;those of endothelial cells. &#173;These barriers are called &#173;either <span class="italic">blood–&#173;aqueous</span> or <span class="italic">blood–&#173;retina barriers,</span> depending on their location in the eye. &#173;Because of &#173;these barriers, the composition and amounts of all materials entering and leaving the eye can be carefully controlled. Perturbations of &#173;these <span class="italic">blood–&#173;ocular barriers</span> cause blood constituents to mix with ocular fluids; this mixing leads to plasmoid aqueous, ret&#173;i&#173;nal exudates, or ret&#173;i&#173;nal edema.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The blood–&#173;aqueous barrier is composed of the tight junctions of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5">nonpigmented ciliary epithelium</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">iris vasculature</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-6">inner wall endothelium of the Schlemm canal</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This barrier restricts plasma proteins from entering the aqueous. Consequently, aqueous is essentially protein-&#173;free, which gives it a refractive index of 1.336 and allows optical clarity for transmission of light along the visual pathway. The blood–&#173;aqueous barrier, along with active transport systems, also allows increased levels of ascorbate and some amino acids in aqueous compared to levels in blood plasma. Breakdown of this barrier is discussed &#173;later in the chapter.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Aqueous Humor Formation and Secretion</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ciliary epithelium is a bilayer of polarized epithelial cells that line the surface of the ciliary body. The 2 cell layers are the nonpigmented epithelium (NPE), which &#173;faces the aqueous humor, and the pigmented epithelium (PE), which &#173;faces the ciliary stroma. These 2 layers are connected to each other at their apical membranes; their basal membranes face the aqueous and ciliary stroma. The NPE has tight junctions proximal to the apical plasma membrane that form part of the blood–&#173;aqueous barrier, thereby preventing paracellular transport from the ciliary stroma into the posterior chamber. In contrast, the PE cell layer is considered a leaky epithelium &#173;because it allows solutes to move through the space between the PE cells.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aqueous humor is secreted by the NPE from a substrate of blood plasma. It is secreted at a flow rate of 2–3 µL/min, but this rate varies according to our circadian rhythm, dropping to 1.0 µL/min at night.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aqueous enters the posterior chamber from the ciliary pro&#173;cesses by means of active and passive physiologic mechanisms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5"><span class="bullet-list_italic">active:</span> energy-&#173;dependent secretion of certain ions and substrates</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-6"><span class="bullet-list_italic">passive:</span> diffusion and ultrafiltration</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The active pro&#173;cess of aqueous secretion involves enzymes pre&#173;sent in the NPE, such as sodium-&#173;potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase) and carbonic anhydrase (CA). Active secretion of sodium by Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase and accompanying anions creates high osmolarity on the basolateral (aqueous) side of the NPE, and this in turn promotes diffusion of &#173;water. In &#173;humans, CA is pre&#173;sent in both PE and NPE. Its inhibitors reduce the rate of entry of sodium and bicarbonate into the aqueous, causing a reduction in aqueous flow. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span> for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Cotransport</span> is the coupled transport of 2 chemical substances across a membrane, with one substance transported down its <a href="https://www.dorlands.com/dorlands/def.jsp?id=100614438">concentration gradient</a>, which drives movement of the other substance against its concentration gradient. Symport and antiport are cotransport mechanisms. <span class="italic">Symporters</span> are membrane proteins that mediate the cotransport of molecules in the same direction, whereas <span class="italic">antiporters</span> mediate the cotransport of molecules in opposite directions. The systems’ activities and cellular distributions along the membranes of PE and NPE cells determine unidirectional net secretion from the ciliary stroma to the posterior chamber, a pro&#173;cess that involves 3 steps (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-1</span>):</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-8">1.&#9;uptake of solute and &#173;water at the stromal surface by PE cells</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;transfer of solute and &#173;water from PE to NPE cells through gap junctions</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-9">3.&#9;transfer of solute and &#173;water by NPE cells into the posterior chamber</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Likewise, it is thought that &#173;there is a mechanism for transporting solute and &#173;water from the posterior chamber back into the stroma. In this unidirectional reabsorption, another set of transporters may be involved in extruding sodium, potassium, and chloride back into the stroma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diffusion is the movement of solutes or ions across a membrane down the concentration or ionic gradient. In aqueous formation, ultrafiltration is the nonenzymatic component that depends on intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure, and the blood osmotic pressure in the ciliary body. Ultrafiltration decreases with increasing IOP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">IOP is maintained by continuous aqueous formation and drainage, which allow removal of metabolic waste products from the surrounding tissues. The &#173;factors determining IOP are summarized in the Goldmann equation and include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5">rate of aqueous production</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">re&#173;sis&#173;tance to outflow</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">the pressure within the episcleral veins receiving drainage from the Schlemm canal</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Inhibitors of enzymatic pro&#173;cesses decrease aqueous inflow by varying amounts, providing additional evidence of active secretory pro&#173;cesses. For more information, see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span> of this volume and BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma.</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-11">Composition of the Aqueous Humor</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;9-1</span> summarizes the composition of the aqueous humor compared with that of plasma and vitreous. Aqueous secretion is not an ultrafiltrate of plasma (as was once speculated), &#173;because it is produced by energy-&#173;dependent pro&#173;cesses in the epithelial layer of the ciliary body. This mode of production allows precise control to be maintained over composition of the fluid that bathes the structures essential for normal vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ionic composition of the aqueous humor is determined by selective active transport systems (eg, Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-2Cl<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">−</span> symport, Cl<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">−</span>-&#173;HCO<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">3</span><span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">−</span> and Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,H<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> antiports, cation channels, &#173;water channels [aquaporin], Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase, K<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> channels, Cl<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">–&#173;</span> channels, H<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase) that participate in secretion of aqueous humor by the NPE. Active secretion of ions and molecules leads to higher levels of ascorbate and some amino acids in aqueous than in plasma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Molecular studies have shown that the secretory properties of the ciliary epithelium are not &#173;limited to ions and electrolytes but extend to a wide range of molecules with dif&#173;fer&#173;ent molecular masses. Common features of many of &#173;these molecules are their local synthesis in the ciliary epithelium and their secretion by the NPE cells through the regulatory pathway into the aqueous humor. Among the proteins whose messenger RNA expression has been demonstrated are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">plasma proteins (eg, complement component C4, <span class="bullet-list_greek">α</span><span class="bullet-list_subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;macroglobulin, selenoprotein P, apolipoprotein D, plasma glutathione peroxidases, angiotensinogen)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">proteinases (eg, cathepsin D, cathepsin O)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">cellular retinaldehyde–&#173;binding protein (CRALBP) and other components of the visual cycle</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">neurotrophic &#173;factor (eg, PE-&#173;derived &#173;factor)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">neuropeptide-&#173;processing enzymes (eg, carboxypeptidase E, peptidylglycine-&#173;<span class="bullet-list_greek">α</span>-&#173;amidating monoxygenase)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">neuroendocrine peptides (eg, secretogranin II, neurotensin, galanin)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-12">bioactive peptides and hormones (eg, atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;These findings support the view that the ciliary epithelium exhibits neuroendocrine properties that are directly related to the makeup of the aqueous humor and its regulation. The aqueous humor composition is in dynamic equilibrium, determined both by its rate of production and outflow and by continuous exchanges with the tissues of the anterior segment. The aqueous contains the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-13">inorganic ions and organic anions</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">carbohydrates</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">glutathione and urea</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">proteins</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">growth-&#173;modulatory &#173;factors</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">oxygen and carbon dioxide<p class="reference--non-journal--single ParaOverride-14">Yang W, Bradley JC, Reid TW, McCartney DL. Growth &#173;factors in aqueous humor. <span class="reference--non-journal-_italic">Ophthalmology</span>. 2011;118(5):1003.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-15">Inorganic Ions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The concentrations of sodium, potassium, and magnesium in the aqueous are similar to &#173;those in plasma, but the level of calcium in aqueous is only half that in plasma. The 2 major anions are chloride and bicarbonate. Phosphate is also pre&#173;sent in the aqueous (aqueous-to-plasma ratio, ≈0.5 or lower), but its concentration is too low to have significant buffering capacity. Iron, copper, and zinc are all found in the aqueous humor at essentially the same levels as in plasma: approximately 1&#160;mg/mL.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-15">Organic Anions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lactate is the most abundant organic anion in the aqueous, and its concentration &#173;there is always higher than that in plasma. The high lactate level in aqueous is a result of glycolytic metabolism, upon which the avascular lens depends.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ascorbate (vitamin C) levels in aqueous are much higher (some 10–50 times higher) than &#173;those in plasma. Ascorbate has antioxidant properties, and its high concentration in the aqueous protects intraocular structures by blocking UV light.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-15">Carbohydrates</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Glucose concentration in the aqueous is roughly 50%–70% of that in plasma. The rate of entry of glucose into the posterior chamber is much more rapid than would be expected from its molecular size and lipid solubility, suggesting that the transport of glucose across the ciliary epithelium occurs by facilitated diffusion.</p>
			<p class="body-text ParaOverride-16"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="Operator_BCSC2019_S02_C09_p269_280_2P-web-resources/image/2.png" alt="" /></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-17">Inositol, which is impor&#173;tant for phospholipid synthesis in the anterior segment, is found in the aqueous at a concentration approximately 10 times higher than that in plasma.</p>
			<p class="h2">Glutathione and Urea</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Glutathione, an impor&#173;tant tripeptide with a reactive sulfhydryl group, is also found in the aqueous humor. Its concentration in primates ranges from 1 to 10 µmol/L. Blood contains a high concentration of glutathione; however, virtually all glutathione resides within the erythrocytes, and plasma has a low concentration of only 5 µmol/L or less. Glutathione stabilizes the oxidation-&#173;reduction (redox) state of the aqueous by reconverting ascorbate to its functional form &#173;after oxidation, as well as by removing excess hydrogen peroxide. Glutathione also serves as a substrate in the enzymatic conjugation by cytosolic enzymes; this pro&#173;cess is involved in the cellular detoxification of electrophilic compounds. &#173;These enzymes (glutathione S-&#173;transferases) are impor&#173;tant in protecting tissues from oxidative damage and oxidative stress and are highly concentrated in the ocular ciliary epithelium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The concentration of urea in the aqueous is between 80% and 90% of that in plasma. This compound is distributed passively across nearly all biological membrane systems, and its high aqueous-to-plasma ratio indicates that this small molecule (molecular weight, 60) readily crosses the epithelial barrier. Urea is effective in hyperosmotic infusion treatment for glaucoma. However, mannitol (molecular weight, 182) is preferred to urea &#173;because urea crosses the epithelial barrier more easily.</p>
			<p class="h2">Proteins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As stated &#173;earlier, the tight junctions of the NPE, along with other structures, establish the blood–&#173;aqueous barrier, which prevents diffusion of plasma proteins from the ciliary stroma into the posterior chamber; nevertheless, plasma proteins do enter the aqueous humor, possibly through the root and anterior surface of the iris. Normal aqueous contains approximately 0.02&#160;g of protein per 100&#160;mL, as compared with the typical plasma level of 7&#160;g per 100&#160;mL. The most abundant plasma proteins identified in aqueous humor are albumin and transferrin, which together may account for 50% of the total protein content.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to the plasma proteins that enter the aqueous, &#173;there is compelling evidence that some proteins may be synthesized within the ciliary body and secreted directly into the aqueous humor. Molecular techniques (such as the screening of complementary DNA [cDNA] libraries constructed from intact &#173;human and bovine ciliary bodies) have enabled the isolation and identification of numerous protein-&#173;encoding genes. &#173;These studies, therefore, challenge the long-&#173;held view that plasma proteins in the aqueous humor are transported into the aqueous from outside the eye. Among the cDNA molecules isolated from the ciliary body are</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-5">C4, a component of the classical complement pathway that participates in immune-&#173;mediated inflammatory responses</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="bullet-list_greek">α</span><span class="bullet-list_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;macroglobulin, a carrier protein that is involved in proteinase inhibition, clearance, and targeting, as well as the pro&#173;cessing of foreign peptides</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">apolipoprotein D, which binds and transports hydrophobic substances, including cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and arachidonic acid (AA)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-3">selenoprotein P, which has antioxidant properties</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Proteinases and inhibitors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several proteinases and proteinase inhibitors have also been identified in the aqueous humor. The proteinases include cathepsin D and cathepsin O, which are synthesized and secreted by the ciliary epithelial cells. Cathepsin D is involved in the degradation of neuro&#173;peptides and peptide hormones and has been found in high levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer disease. Less is known about cathepsin O, which may be involved in normal cellular protein degradation and turnover.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Of the proteinase inhibitors, <span class="greek">α</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>-&#173;macroglobulin and <span class="greek">α</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">1</span>-&#173;antitrypsin are perhaps the most extensively studied. An imbalance in equilibrium between proteinases and proteinase inhibitors could alter aqueous humor composition, which may cause disease (eg, glaucoma).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Enzymes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Activators, proenzymes, and fibrinolytic enzymes are pre&#173;sent in the aqueous and could play a role in the regulation of outflow re&#173;sis&#173;tance. Both plasminogen and plasminogen activator are found in &#173;human and monkey aqueous, but only traces of plasmin have been reported.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-7">Neurotrophic and neuroendocrine proteins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ciliary epithelia, which are derived from neuroectoderm, are functionally similar to neuroendocrine glands elsewhere in the body. The ciliary body has neuroendocrine peptides and neuroendocrine pro&#173;cessing enzymes. Bioactive neuroendocrine markers, identified through &#173;human ciliary body cDNA subtraction studies, include neurotensin, angiotensin, endothelins, and natriuretic peptides; &#173;these markers are known to have systemic vascular hemodynamic effects and, by implication, may have similar roles in IOP regulation or aqueous secretion. The neuroendocrine properties of the ciliary epithelium may determine the composition of the aqueous humor, the diurnal (circadian) rhythm of aqueous humor secretion and IOP, the ciliary blood flow, and the immune privilege status of intraocular structures.</p>

			<p class="h2">Growth-&#173;Modulatory &#173;Factors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The physical and chemical properties of the aqueous humor play a substantial role in modulating the proliferation, differentiation, functional viability, and wound healing of ocular tissues. &#173;These properties are largely influenced by several growth-&#173;promoting and differentiation &#173;factors that have been identified or quantified in aqueous humor, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-19">transforming growth &#173;factor <span class="bullet-list_greek">β</span>s 1 and 2 (TGF-&#173;<span class="bullet-list_greek">β</span><span class="bullet-list_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> and -&#173;<span class="bullet-list_greek">β</span><span class="bullet-list_subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">acidic and basic fibroblast growth &#173;factors (aFGF and bFGF)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">insulin-&#173;like growth &#173;factor I (IGF-&#173;I)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">insulin-&#173;like growth &#173;factor binding proteins (IGFBPs)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">vascular endothelial growth &#173;factors (VEGFs)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-20">transferrin</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The growth &#173;factors in the aqueous humor perform diverse, synergistic, and sometimes opposite biological activities. Normally, the lack of significant mitosis of the corneal endothelium and trabecular meshwork in vivo is prob&#173;ably controlled by the complex coordination of effects and interactions among the dif&#173;fer&#173;ent growth-&#173;modulatory substances pre&#173;sent in the aqueous humor (see <span class="xref-local">Part V, Ocular Pharmacology</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Disruption in the balance among vari&#173;ous growth &#173;factors, which occurs with the production of plasmoid aqueous humor as a result of breakdown of the blood–&#173;aqueous barrier, may explain the abnormal hyperplastic response of the lens epithelium and corneal endothelium observed in chronic inflammatory conditions and traumatic insults to the eye. Ultimately, however, the effect of a given growth &#173;factor on the aqueous humor is determined primarily by the growth &#173;factor’s bioavailability. Bioavailability, in turn, depends on many &#173;factors, including the expression of receptors on target tissues, interactive effects of the growth &#173;factor with components of the extracellular matrix, and the levels of circulating and matrix-&#173;bound proteases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Growth &#173;factor levels in the aqueous humor are altered in several disease states. Levels of IGFBPs are elevated fivefold in patients with diabetes mellitus without retinopathy, and IGF-&#173;I levels are elevated in patients with diabetic retinopathy. VEGF levels in the aqueous humor are elevated in eyes with acute nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, whereas interleukin-2 concentration is reduced.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The VEGF &#173;family of glycoproteins includes VEGF-&#173;A, -&#173;B, -&#173;C, and -&#173;D, as well as placental growth &#173;factor (PlGF). VEGF-&#173;A, the most thoroughly studied at pre&#173;sent, has 9 isoforms and is the only VEGF &#173;family member induced by hypoxia. VEGF-&#173;A is a crucial regulator of vasculogenesis (embryologic blood vessel development from mesodermal ele&#173;ments) and a potent inducer of vascular permeability and angiogenesis (neovascularization). VEGF-&#173;C and VEGF-&#173;D regulate lymphangiogenesis. VEGF receptors (VEGFR) are tyrosine kinases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Three VEGFRs have been identified:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">VEGFR-1 has high affinity for VEGF-&#173;A, VEGF-&#173;B, and PlGF. Functionally, it acts as a negative regulator of VEGF-&#173;A signaling by limiting the amount of ligand available to VEGFR-2.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">VEGFR-2 is the primary mediator of the mitogenic, angiogenic, and vascular permeability effects of VEGF-&#173;A.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-20">VEGFR-3 mediates the angiogenic effects of VEGF-&#173;C and VEGF-&#173;D on lymphatic vessels.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Although VEGF-&#173;A and its receptors are most studied in relation to the vascular endothelium, they are also pre&#173;sent in other tissues and organ systems, a finding that underscores other pos&#173;si&#173;ble physiological roles, such as ret&#173;i&#173;nal leukostasis and neuroprotection. In addition, VEGF-&#173;A may play a role in regulating IOP by elevating levels of nitric oxide (NO), which increases aqueous outflow fa&#173;cil&#173;i&#173;ty. VEGF-&#173;A upregulates expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), which produces NO; VEGF-&#173;A blockage may cause IOP elevation by decreasing NO production.</p>
			<p class="body-text">VEGF-&#173;A levels in ocular fluids are elevated not only in patients with active ocular neovascularization from proliferative diabetic retinopathy but also &#173;after central ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion and in eyes with iris neovascularization. The expression of VEGF is increased by hypoxia in ret&#173;i&#173;nal endothelial cells, ret&#173;i&#173;nal pericytes, M<span class="accent">ü</span>ller cells, ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium cells, and the NPE cells of the ciliary body. Also, levels of VEGF-&#173;A in the aqueous humor increase in response to anterior segment ischemia in animal models, as well as in response to ret&#173;i&#173;nal hypoxia. Aqueous VEGF-&#173;A levels fall &#173;after intravitreal injection of anti-&#173;VEGF agents.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-25">Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Oxygen in the aqueous humor is derived from the blood supply to the ciliary body and iris, as the atmospheric oxygen flux across the cornea is negligible. Indeed, the corneal endothelium depends critically on the aqueous oxygen supply for the active fluid-&#173;transport mechanism that maintains corneal transparency. The lens and the endothelial lining of the trabecular meshwork also derive their oxygen supply from the aqueous. Oxygen is pre&#173;sent in the aqueous humor at a partial pressure lower than that in arterial blood.</p>

			<p class="body-text">The carbon dioxide content of the aqueous ranges from about 40 to 60&#160;mm Hg, contributing approximately 3% of the total bicarbonate. The relative proportions of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate determine the pH of the aqueous, which in most species ranges between 7.5 and 7.6. Carbon dioxide is continuously lost from the aqueous by diffusion across the cornea into the tear film and atmosphere.</p>

			<p class="h1">Clinical Implications of Breakdown of the Blood–Aqueous Barrier</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The blood–&#173;aqueous barrier may be disrupted in a number of conditions, including ocular trauma (mechanical, chemical, or physical), infection or inflammation, and ischemia, as well as with use of pharmacologic agents (eg, prostaglandin analogues, cholinesterase inhibitors). With compromise of the blood–&#173;aqueous barrier, the levels of inflammatory medi&#173;ators, immunoglobulins, fibrin, and proteases rise, and the balance among the vari&#173;ous growth &#173;factors is disrupted. The protein content of the aqueous humor increases, possibly as much as 10–100 times normal, especially in high-&#173;molecular-&#173;weight polypeptides.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical sequelae include fibrinous exudate (with or without a macrophage reaction and formation of cyclitic membranes) and synechiae formation (peripheral and posterior), as well as an abnormal neovascular response, which further exacerbates breakdown of the blood–&#173;aqueous barrier. Chronic disruption of this barrier is implicated in the abnormal hyperplastic response of the lens epithelium, corneal endothelium, trabecular meshwork, and iris, and in the formation of complicated cataracts. Degenerative and proliferative changes may occur in vari&#173;ous ocular structures as well. The use of anti-&#173;inflammatory ste&#173;roidal and nonsteroidal drugs, cycloplegics, protease activators or inhibitors, growth &#173;factor and anti–&#173;growth &#173;factor agents, and even surgical intervention may be necessary to combat &#173;these events.</p>

					<p class="figure-caption"><span class="figure-number">Figure&#160;9-1</span> Production and secretion of aqueous humor. The oncotic pressure of the ciliary body stroma draws &#173;water &#173;toward the stroma from the neighboring blood vessel but also away from the posterior chamber. Thus, energy-&#173;dependent mechanisms (active transport) are needed to secrete &#173;water across the ciliary epithelium. This is accomplished by sodium-&#173;potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na<span class="figure-caption_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="figure-caption_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase), which pumps Na<span class="figure-caption_symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> into the posterior chamber.
