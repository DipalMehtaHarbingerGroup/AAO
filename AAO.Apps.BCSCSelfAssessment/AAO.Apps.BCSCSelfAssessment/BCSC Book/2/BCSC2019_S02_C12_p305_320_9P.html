			<p class="h1">Photoreceptors and Phototransduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Phototransduction</span> is the pro&#173;cess by which photosensitive cells in the ret&#173;ina convert light energy into an electrical impulse that is transmitted to the brain. Rods and cones are highly polarized photoreceptor cells that capture energy from photons and generate a neural response. Rods are highly sensitive and can be stimulated by a single photon. Cones are less sensitive than rods, but they can adapt to a wider range of light intensities and respond more rapidly to repetitive stimulation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Rod Phototransduction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most of our knowledge of phototransduction comes from information known about rods, which are sensitive nocturnal light detectors. Considerably more biochemical material can be obtained from rods than from cones &#173;because rods are much more numerous in most ret&#173;i&#173;nas. In addition, rods contain far more membrane (ie, surface area) than do cones, which contributes to the rods’ greater sensitivity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The outer segment of photoreceptors contains all the components required for phototransduction. It is composed primarily of plasma-&#173;membrane material or&#173;ga&#173;nized into discs flattened perpendicular to the long axis of the outer segment (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2</span>, <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig</span>&#160;<span class="xref-local">2-33</span>). &#173;There are approximately 1000 discs within a rod outer segment and 1 million membrane-&#173;bound rhodopsin molecules in each disc. The discs float within the cytoplasm of the outer segment like a stack of coins disconnected from the plasma membrane. The discs contain the protein machinery to capture and amplify light energy. This abundance of outer-&#173;segment membrane increases the number of rhodopsin molecules, which can absorb light. Some deep-&#173;sea fish, which need considerable sensitivity to detect small amounts of light, rely on longer rod segments than &#173;those found in &#173;humans.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Rhodopsin is a freely diffusible membrane protein with 7 helical loops that is embedded in the lipid membrane (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-2</span>). Rhodopsin absorbs green light best at wavelengths of approximately 510&#160;nm. It absorbs blue and yellow light less well and is insensitive to longer wavelengths (red light). Rhodopsin is tuned to this part&#160;of the electromagnetic spectrum by its amino-&#173;acid sequence and by the binding of its chromophore 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis</span>-&#173;retinal (also called 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis</span>-&#173;retinaldehyde), which creates a molecular antenna.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The plasma membrane of the outer segment contains the cationic cyclic nucleotide–&#173;gated (CNG) channels, which are gated by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This channel controls the flow of sodium (Na<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>) and calcium (Ca<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>) ions into the outer segment. In the dark, Na<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> and Ca<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> flow in through the channel, which is kept open by cGMP. Ionic balance is maintained by Na<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;ATPase (also called<span class="italic"> sodium-&#173;potassium pump</span>) in the inner segment and a Na<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;Ca<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> exchanger in the outer-&#173;segment membrane, both of which require metabolic energy. This flow of ions sets up the circulating dark current that keeps the photoreceptor’s membrane potential in a relatively depolarized state. The depolarized state of the photoreceptors &#173;causes a steady release of the transmitter glutamate from its synaptic terminal in the dark (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Light activation of rhodopsin starts a series of reactions that lead to hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor’s membrane potential (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-4</span>). Once rhodopsin absorbs a quantum of light, the 11-&#173;<span class="italic">cis</span> double bond of ret&#173;i&#173;nal is reconfigured (creating all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans</span>-&#173;retinal, also called all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans</span>-&#173;retinaldehyde), and the opsin molecule undergoes a series of rapid configurational changes to an activated state known as <span class="italic">metarhodopsin II.</span> Light-&#173;activated rhodopsin triggers a second molecule, transducin, by causing an exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;12-4A</span>). One rhodopsin molecule can activate 100 transducin molecules, amplifying the reaction. Activated transducin excites a third protein, cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), which hydrolyzes cGMP to 5<span class="symbol">′</span>-&#173;noncyclic GMP. The decrease in cGMP closes the CNG channels, which stops entry of Na<span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> and Ca<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> and hyperpolarizes the rod. Hyperpolarization stops the release of glutamate from the synaptic terminal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When the light is extinguished, the rod returns to its dark state as the reaction cascade turns off. Recovery of the dark current requires that the catalytically active components of the phototransduction cascade be fully quenched and cGMP resynthesized to allow opening of the CNG channels. Rhodopsin is inactivated by phosphorylation at its C-&#173;terminal end by rhodopsin kinase and subsequent binding to arrestin (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;12-4B</span>). Inactivation of rhodopsin is aided by recoverin, a highly conserved Ca<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-&#173;binding protein found in both rods and cones. Transducin is inactivated by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP via transducin’s intrinsic GTPase activity, which reduces PDE activity. Closure of the CNG channels with light activation also &#173;causes a drop in intracellular Ca<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> levels, which in turn stimulates ret&#173;i&#173;nal guanylate cyclase (also called <span class="italic">guanylyl cyclase</span>), the enzyme that synthesizes cGMP from GTP; the enzyme’s action is assisted by guanylate cyclase–&#173;assisting proteins (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig&#160;12-4C</span>). As cGMP levels increase, the CNG channels open and the rod is depolarized again. The corresponding rise in intracellular Ca<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="symbol_superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span> levels inhibits ret&#173;i&#173;nal guanylate cyclase activity to its dark level.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">“Rim” proteins</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The discs of rod outer segments differ from &#173;those of cones in that they are disconnected from the outer plasma membrane. The rim of each rod disc has a collection of proteins. Two such proteins are peripherin and rod outer segment protein 1 (ROM1), which play a role in the development and maintenance of the disc’s curvature. Peripherin and ROM1 are also found in cone outer segments. Another protein in rod discs is ABCA4, an ATP-&#173;binding cassette (ABC) transporter. It is a transmembrane protein involved in the energy-&#173;dependent transport of substrates from the disc lumen to the rod cytosol. ABCA4 is unique to rod discs and is not found in cones. It functions as a transporter of all-&#173;<span class="italic">trans</span>-&#173;retinal.</p>

			<p class="h2">Energy Metabolism of Photoreceptor Outer Segments</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is necessary to drive the reactions that control the ionic current generators as well as the transporters in the outer segment. &#173;Because only the inner, and not the outer, segment contains mitochondria, oxidative metabolism is confined to the former. The outer segment is responsible for glycolysis, including the hexose monophosphate pathway and the phosphocreatine shut&#173;tle, which produces ATP and GTP and modulates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). NADPH reduces ret&#173;i&#173;nal to retinol before it is returned to the RPE for isomerization, and it reduces glutathione, which protects against oxidative stress.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Cone Phototransduction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Qualitatively, the phototransduction of cones resembles that of rods. Light-&#173;activated cone opsins initiate an enzymatic cascade that hydrolyzes cGMP and closes cone-&#173;specific cGMP–&#173;gated cationic channels on the outer-&#173;segment membrane. Cone phototransduction is comparatively insensitive but fast and capable of adapting significantly to ambient levels of illumination. The greater the ambient light level is, the faster and more temporally accurate is the response of a cone. Speed and temporal fidelity are impor&#173;tant for all aspects of cone vision. This is one reason visual acuity improves progressively with increased illumination. &#173;Because of their ability to adapt, cones are indispensable to good vision. A person without cones loses the ability to read and see colors and can be legally blind. In comparison, lost rod function is a less severe visual prob&#173;lem, except &#173;under scotopic conditions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several &#173;factors contribute to light adaptation. For example, higher levels of illumination bleach away photopigments, making the outer segment less sensitive to light. As light levels increase, so does the noise level, which reduces sensitivity. Biochemical and neural feedback speed up the cone response. This feedback must be increased as light intensity increases and the cone absorbs more and more light. All the pro&#173;cesses that turn off the rod response are prob&#173;ably stronger in cones.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cones also show neurally mediated negative feedback. Horizontal cells of the inner nuclear layer synapse antagonistically back onto cones, releasing <span class="greek">γ</span>-&#173;aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter. When light hyperpolarizes a cone, the cone hyperpolarizes neighboring horizontal cells. This effect inhibits the horizontal cells, stopping the release of GABA, which depolarizes (disinhibits) the cone by a recurrent synapse. This depolarization antagonizes the hyperpolarization produced by light and restores the cone to its resting state. Depolarization occurs with a synaptic delay so that its main effect is on the &#173;later response of the cone. Horizontal-&#173;cell feedback occurs with strong stimuli, preventing the cone from being overloaded. The feedback also turns off the cone response more quickly, enabling the cone to respond rapidly to a new stimulus. <span class="italic">Flicker fusion threshold</span> is the frequency of a repetitive stimulus at which it appears to be a completely steady light stimulus. This threshold is much higher in cones (approximately 100&#160;Hz) than in rods (approximately 30&#160;Hz).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Trivariant color vision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">To see colors, mammals must have at least 2 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent spectral classes of cones. Most &#173;humans with normal vision have 3 types of cones and consequently a 3-&#173;variable color vision (3 cone opsins) system:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-8">short-&#173;wavelength-&#173;sensitive cones (termed <span class="bullet-list_italic">S cones</span>), which detect only color by comparing their signals with &#173;those of the M cones; this mechanism creates blue-&#173;yellow color vision</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">middle-&#173;wavelength-&#173;sensitive cones (termed <span class="bullet-list_italic">M cones</span>), which detect high-&#173;resolution achromatic (black and white) contrast</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-9">long-&#173;wavelength-&#173;sensitive cones (termed <span class="bullet-list_italic">L cones</span>), which evolved in primates to enhance color vision; this mechanism creates red-&#173;green color vision</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Both L and M cones contribute to achromatic and chromatic contrast. Therefore, both are more numerous than S cones in the &#173;human ret&#173;ina.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most color vision defects involve red-&#173;green discrimination and the genes coding for the L-&#173; and M-&#173;cone opsins. &#173;These genes are in tandem on the X chromosome. &#173;There is 1 copy of the L-&#173;cone opsin gene at the centromeric end of the X chromosome, and &#173;there are 1–6 copies of the M-&#173;cone gene arranged in a head-&#173;to-&#173;tail tandem array. Normally, only the most proximal of &#173;these 2 genes is expressed. Most color vision abnormalities are caused by unequal crossing over between the L-&#173; and M-&#173;cone opsin genes. This in&#173;equality creates hybrid opsins that have dif&#173;fer&#173;ent spectral absorption functions, which are usually less ideal than &#173;those of normal opsins. Some males have a serine-&#173;to-&#173;alanine substitution at amino acid 108 on the cone opsin gene, which allows more sensitivity to red light. Potentially, females with both the serine-&#173;containing and the alanine-&#173;containing opsins could have tetravariant color vision.</p>
			<p class="h2">Photoreceptor Gene Defects Causing Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Degeneration</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Gene mutations involving the phototransduction pathway lead to inherited ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies with varying degrees of visual impairment. &#173;These mutations can disrupt physiology in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ways; they can alter the transduction cascade, protein folding, or localization of the affected protein. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), and Stargardt disease are among the most prevalent inherited ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies. Autosomal dominant RP (ADRP) can be caused by more than 100 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent mutations in the rhodopsin gene <span class="italic">(RHO).</span> The most common <span class="italic">RHO</span> mutation is P23H (responsible for 10% of RP cases in the United States), which &#173;causes the rhodopsin protein not to fold properly and instead to accumulate in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Generally, <span class="italic">RHO</span> mutations affecting the intradiscal area and amino-&#173;terminal end of rhodopsin result in less severe defects than do mutations affecting the cytoplasmic region and the carboxyl tail. Alterations in the &#173;middle of the gene, coding for the transmembrane regions of rhodopsin, result in moderately severe defects. Relatively uncommon mutations have been reported in the rhodopsin gene that cause autosomal recessive RP (ARRP) and a stationary form of nyctalopia. See <span class="xref-table">&#173;Tables&#160;12-1 through 12-4</span> for other gene mutations that cause inherited ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies.</p>

			<p class="h1">Classes of Retinal Cells</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ret&#173;ina contains 3 broad classes of cells (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-5</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">neurons (photoreceptor, bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, and ganglion cells)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">glial cells (M<span class="bullet-list_accent">ü</span>ller cells, astrocytes, microglia)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">vascular cells (endothelial cells and pericytes)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The major route of information flow from photoreceptors to the optic nerve consists of a 3-&#173;neuron chain—&#173;photoreceptor cell to bipolar cell to ganglion cell. Horizontal cells and amacrine cells are interneurons that regulate the flow of information. Glial cells and vascular ele&#173;ments support the neuronal components.</p>
			<p class="h2">Neurons</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Bipolar cells</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal bipolar cells receive neural signals from photoreceptors (discussed &#173;earlier in the chapter) and convey them to the inner ret&#173;ina. Separate bipolar cells exist for cones and rods. Morphologically, &#173;there are 9–12 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent kinds of cone bipolar cells but only 1 type of rod bipolar cell. Functionally, in the cone pathway &#173;there are <span class="italic">on-&#173;bipolar</span> and <span class="italic">off-&#173;bipolar</span> cells (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-6</span>). On-&#173;bipolar cells are optimized to detect increases in light intensity, and off-&#173;bipolar cells detect decreases in light intensity. When light hyperpolarizes a cone, the on-&#173;bipolar cell is excited (turned on), and the off-&#173;bipolar cell is inhibited (turned off). When a shadow depolarizes the cones, the opposite occurs (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some cone bipolar cells synapse only with L cones and &#173;others only with M cones (see the section “Trivariant color vision”), a differentiation that is necessary for color vision. In the fovea, some cone bipolar cells (midget bipolar cells) synapse with a single L or M cone, which allows the highest spatial acuity. This cone selectivity is preserved throughout the ganglion cell layer. Selectivity for L-&#173; or M-&#173;cone inputs is transmitted by a tonic responding system of small ganglion cells. Separate L-&#173; and M-&#173;cone on-&#173;bipolar cells and off-&#173;bipolar cells transmit a faster, phasic signal to a parallel system of larger ganglion cells. Rods and prob&#173;ably S cones have only on-&#173;bipolar cells. Thus, neither rods nor S cones are involved in high spatial resolution. S cones are involved in color vision; rods, in dim light (night vision).</p>
			<p class="h3">Horizontal cells</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Horizontal cells are antagonistic interneurons that provide negative feedback to photoreceptors (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Figs&#160;12-5, 12-6</span>). The dendrites of horizontal cells synapse with cones. One type of horizontal cell modulates L and M cones; another type modulates mainly S cones. The dendrites of horizontal cells receive glutamate from cones and rods and release GABA back onto them. This pro&#173;cess provides negative feedback. When light &#173;causes the cone to hyperpolarize and stop its transmitter release, the neighboring horizontal cells are also hyperpolarized (turned off). This effect stops the release of GABA from the horizontal cell onto the cone, consequently depolarizing the cone. This feedback inhibition allows visualization of low-&#173;contrast details against background luminance.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Amacrine cells</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Like horizontal cells, amacrine cells are inhibitory interneurons. Cone amacrine cells mediate antagonistic interactions among on-&#173;bipolar, off-&#173;bipolar, and ganglion cells. Rod bipolar cells do not usually synapse directly with ganglion cells but rather send their signal to amacrine cells, which then deliver the signal to on-&#173; and off-&#173;bipolar ganglion cells. Thus, rod signals undergo additional synaptic delays before they reach the ganglion cell output.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-11">Ganglion cells</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The functional division of the cone pathway into on and off channels begins at the first synapse (between the cones and the on-&#173;bipolar or off-&#173;bipolar cells). This division is preserved across the pathway to the higher visual centers. On-&#173;bipolar cells synapse with on-&#173;ganglion cells and off-&#173;bipolar cells with off-&#173;ganglion cells. Midget ganglion cells, a special type of ganglion cell with small dendritic trees, are dominant in the central macula. They have a 1:1:1 ratio with cones and midget bipolar cells, allowing high spatial resolution.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ganglion cells can be divided into 3 subgroups: (1) tonic cells driven by L or M cones; (2) tonic cells driven by S cones; and (3) phasic cells. The tonic system transmits signals from the cones that are relatively well maintained for the duration of the light or dark stimulus. The phasic system transmits signals at the beginning or end of a light stimulus, producing a brief or transient response.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tonic cells driven by &#173;either L or M cones include small cells concentrated in the fovea (responsible for high acuity) and other cells located extrafoveally. They mediate both high spatial resolution and color vision. Tonic cells driven by S cones are designed to detect successive color contrast, for example, blue-&#173;yellow or gray-&#173;brown borders. &#173;These ganglion cells are excited by short waves entering and long waves leaving their receptive fields. Phasic cells are larger, less concentrated in the fovea, and faster conducting than the other ganglion cells. Phasic cells may be impor&#173;tant in movement detection.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition to neural and glial cells, the ret&#173;ina contains blood vessels with endothelial cells and pericytes. Pericytes surround the endothelial cells and are modified smooth muscle cells that play a role in autoregulation of ret&#173;i&#173;nal blood vessels. Endothelial cells form the blood–&#173;retina barrier; pericytes structurally support the endothelium and suppress proliferation, loss of which leads to increased permeability and development of microaneurysms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The neuronal, glial, and vascular components of the ret&#173;ina together form a functional neurovascular unit. Ophthalmoscopically, the vascular components are the only vis&#173;i&#173;ble part&#160;of the ret&#173;ina. The neural ret&#173;ina lacks pigment (except for foveal xanthophyll) and is transparent, thus allowing the passage of light through the inner ret&#173;i&#173;nal layers. Conditions such as diabetic retinopathy are categorized on the basis of clinically evident vascular changes. Despite the clinical emphasis on vascular changes, &#173;there is strong evidence of neuronal dysfunction early in the disease pro&#173;cess, even prior to the detection of clinically evident disease.</p>

The cone response is rapid; it turns off while the light is still on and overshoots the dark potential (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;12-7</span>). The rod response is more prolonged and turns off very slowly. Darkness depolarizes the cone and has &#173;little influence on the rod, which is saturated at high light levels and too slow to respond to the shadow.</p>

Absorbing light hyperpolarizes the cone; this, in turn, hyperpolarizes the horizontal cell, which resembles an off-&#173;bipolar cell. <span class="figure-source-note">(Courtesy of Peter Gouras, MD.)</span></p>
