			<div id="Chapt12_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs) are a group of strabismus entities that have in common a developmental defect of one or more cranial nerves. &#173;There can be nuclear hypoplasia, nerve misdirection, and/or or absence of the nerves themselves. &#173;These anomalies lead to vari&#173;ous patterns of abnormal innervation of the eye muscles that often result in secondary abnormal structural changes to the affected muscles, usually stiffening or contracture. Onset of the innervation anomalies can be as early as the first trimester in utero. Included in this group are Duane retraction syndrome, congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles, M<span class="accent">ö</span>bius syndrome, and some cases of congenital fourth nerve palsy (see Chapter&#160;11). In recent work, congenital Brown syndrome has been postulated to be a form of CCDD.</p>

			<p class="h2">Duane Retraction Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Duane retraction syndrome is a spectrum of ocular motility disorders characterized by anomalous co-&#173;contraction of the medial and lateral rectus muscles on &#173;actual or attempted adduction of the involved eye or eyes; this co-&#173;contraction &#173;causes the globe to retract. Horizontal eye movement can be limited to vari&#173;ous degrees in both abduction and adduction. An upshoot or downshoot often occurs when the affected eye is innervated to adduct; vertical slippage of a tight lateral rectus muscle by 1–2&#160;mm, which has been demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, is the typical cause. Less commonly, anomalous vertical rectus muscle activity is responsible for upshoots and downshoots.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although most affected patients have Duane retraction syndrome alone, many associated systemic defects have been noted, such as Goldenhar syndrome (hemifacial microsomia, ocular dermoids, ear anomalies, preauricular skin tags, and eyelid colobomas) and Wildervanck syndrome (sensorineural hearing loss and Klippel-&#173;Feil anomaly with fused cervical vertebrae). Studies of patients with Duane retraction syndrome related to prenatal thalidomide exposure show that the under&#173;lying defect in development occurs between the fourth and sixth weeks of gestation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most cases of Duane retraction syndrome are sporadic, but approximately 5%–10% show autosomal dominant inheritance. Instances of links to more generalized disorders have been reported. Discordance in monozygotic twins raises the possibility that the intrauterine environment may play a role in the development of this syndrome. A higher prevalence in females is reported in most series, and &#173;there is a predilection for the left eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In most anatomical and imaging studies, the nucleus of the sixth cranial nerve is absent or hypoplastic and an aberrant branch of the third cranial nerve innervates the lateral rectus muscle. Results of electromyographic studies have been consistent with this finding. Although Duane retraction syndrome is considered an innervational anomaly, tight and broadly inserted medial rectus muscles and fibrotic lateral rectus muscles, with corresponding forced duction abnormalities, are often encountered during surgery.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most widely used classification of Duane retraction syndrome defines 3 types, but they may represent differences only in the severity of horizontal rotation limitations. Type&#160;1 refers to poor abduction, frequently with esotropia in primary position (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-1</span>); type 2 refers to poor adduction and exotropia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-2</span>); and type 3 refers to poor abduction and adduction, with esotropia, exotropia, or no primary position deviation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-3</span>). Approximately 15% of cases are bilateral; the type may differ between the 2&#160;eyes. The spectrum of dysinnervation among cases means that classification of patients based on &#173;these categories can be arbitrary in some situations, especially in deciding between type 1 and type 3. <span class="italic">Synergistic divergence</span> is a rare and bizarre motility disturbance that is often classified as a fourth type of Duane syndrome. &#173;There is usually exotropia, and when the affected eye looks in the direction that should result in adduction, it actually abducts even further—&#173;a finding colorfully described as “the ocular splits.” Synergistic divergence can be unilateral or bilateral and can be due to biallelic <span class="italic">COL25A1</span> mutations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Type 1 (with esotropia and limited abduction) is the most common form of Duane retraction syndrome, accounting for 50%–80% of cases in several series. Affected individuals or their caregivers often incorrectly believe that the normal eye is turning in excessively, not realizing that the involved eye is failing to abduct. Observation of globe retraction on adduction obviates the need for neurologic investigation for sixth nerve palsy, from which it must be differentiated; however, retraction can be difficult to appreciate in an infant. Another indicator that the condition is not sixth nerve palsy is the relatively small esotropia in primary position (usually <span class="symbol">&lt;</span>30 prism diopters [<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">Δ</span>]) in the setting of a severe abduction deficit. A further point of differentiation is that even in esotropic Duane retraction syndrome, a small-&#173;angle exotropia is sometimes pres&#173;ent on gaze to the side opposite that of the affected eye, a finding that does not occur in lateral rectus muscle paralysis. Fi&#173;nally, examination at the slit lamp can help confirm the diagnosis in mild cases: if the vertical slit-&#173;lamp beam cast from the cornea onto the lower eyelid is disrupted by globe retraction when the eye adducts, Duane retraction syndrome is pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">No surgical approach &#173;will normalize rotations. Surgery is reserved for cases with a primary position deviation, a head turn, marked globe retraction, or large upshoots or downshoots. &#173;Because Duane retraction syndrome is a spectrum of motility disorders, the surgical plan must be individualized for the patient. In many patients with this syndrome, the eyes are properly aligned in at least 1 position of gaze, allowing the development of binocular vision. The main goal of surgery is to centralize this field of single binocular vision to eliminate the need for a head turn. Expansion of the field of single binocular vision, while laudable, is more relevant in patients with sixth nerve palsy than in &#173;those with Duane syndrome, who rarely report diplopia in ipsilateral gaze.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For unilateral type 1 Duane retraction syndrome, recession of the medial rectus muscle on the involved side has been the procedure most often used to correct the primary position deviation and eliminate the head turn. Adding recession of the opposite medial rectus (bilateral surgery) has been advocated by some surgeons, but the rationale is unclear, as this does not increase innervation to the lateral rectus muscle (as it would in sixth nerve paresis) and any decrease in medial rectus innervation is offset by a decrease in anomalous innervation to the lateral rectus muscle of the involved eye. &#173;These operations do not usually improve abduction significantly. Primary position overcorrection can occur due to excessive medial rectus recession, and the resulting exotropia &#173;will worsen in the field of gaze in which the involved eye is adducted. Recession of the lateral rectus muscle of the uninvolved eye can offset this effect to some extent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because of concern that lateral rectus muscle resection &#173;will exacerbate globe retraction, most surgeons do not &#173;favor this approach. Occasionally, however, &#173;there are patients with minimal co-&#173;contraction in whom a small resection (<span class="symbol">&lt;</span>3–4&#160;mm) can produce dramatic improvement in abduction. Partial or full lateral transposition of both vertical &#173;rectus muscles or the superior rectus alone, usually with medial rectus recession, with or without posterior scleral fixation (myopexy), has been shown to improve abduction in some patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most commonly recommended surgery for type 2 Duane retraction syndrome is recession of the lateral rectus muscle on the involved side; resection of the medial rectus muscle is avoided. Some surgeons recess both lateral rectus muscles if a large-&#173;angle exotropia is pres&#173;ent, but when a fixating unaffected eye is operated on, the effect of increased contralateral medial rectus innervation (and associated lateral rectus anomalous innervation) must be considered.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with type 3 Duane retraction syndrome often have straight eyes near the primary position and do not require surgical treatment for their minimal head turn or horizontal strabismus. Globe retraction may be severe enough to warrant treatment and can be lessened by recession of both the medial and the lateral rectus muscles, which may also reduce any upshoot or downshoot in adduction. This is also an option for treating retraction in type 1 and type 2 Duane retraction syndrome. The lateral recession must be large to improve the retraction. Other procedures to address an upshoot or downshoot include splitting of the lateral rectus muscle in a Y configuration, retroequatorial fixation of the lateral rectus muscle and, more recently, deactivation of the lateral rectus muscle, such as by disinsertion and reattachment to the lateral periosteum of the orbit with a subsequent transposition procedure.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Congenital Fibrosis of the Extraocular Muscles</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM), or congenital fibrosis syndrome, is a group of rare congenital disorders in which EOM restriction is pres&#173;ent and fibrous tissue replaces &#173;these muscles. Some forms have been noted to be inherited, usually as an autosomal dominant trait but occasionally in an autosomal recessive fashion. Cases of CFEOM involve developmental defects of cranial nerve nuclei and of the nerves themselves, resulting in dysinnervation and abnormal structure of the EOMs.</p>

			<p class="h3">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Depending upon the type of CFEOM, &#173;there may be vari&#173;ous combinations of esotropia with limited abduction, exotropia with limited adduction, limited elevation with chin-up head position, and ptosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Strabismus fixus</span> involves the horizontal rectus muscles, usually the medial rectus muscles, causing severe esotropia. The condition is usually sporadic and can be acquired late.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Vertical retraction syndrome</span> affects the superior rectus muscle and &#173;causes inability to depress the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Diagnosis of CFEOM depends on finding limited voluntary motion with restriction, which is usually severe and can be confirmed with forced duction testing. The congenital onset is impor&#173;tant in distinguishing the syndrome from thyroid eye disease.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Surgery for CFEOM is difficult and requires release of the restricted muscles (ie, weakening procedures). Fibrosis of the adjacent tissues may be pres&#173;ent as well. A good surgical result aligns the eyes in primary position, but full ocular rotations cannot be restored and the outcome is unpredictable.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Möbius Syndrome</p>
			<p class="h3-h2 ParaOverride-4">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">M<span class="accent">ö</span>bius syndrome (or “sequence”; see <span class="xref-figure-local">Chapter&#160;15 discussion of sequence</span>) is a rare condition characterized by the association of both sixth and seventh nerve palsies, the latter causing masklike facies. Patients may also manifest gaze palsies that can be attributed to abnormalities in the paramedian pontine reticular formation or the sixth cranial nerve nucleus. Many patients also have limb, chest, and tongue defects. Some ge&#173;ne&#173;ticists believe that M<span class="accent">ö</span>bius syndrome is one of a &#173;family of syndromes in which hypoplastic limb anomalies may be associated with orofacial and cranial nerve defects. Poland syndrome (absent pectoralis muscle) is another variant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with M<span class="accent">ö</span>bius syndrome exhibit 1 of 3 patterns of ocular motility involvement, which are likely related to the severity and timing of the in utero insult:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">orthotropia in primary position with marked deficits in abduction and adduction (40% of cases) (Fig 12-4)</li>

			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Medial rectus muscle recession has been advocated for patients with large-&#173;angle esotropia, but caution should be exercised in the presence of a significant limitation of adduction. Some surgeons have endeavored to improve abduction by performing vertical rectus muscle transposition procedures &#173;after medial rectus muscle restriction has been relieved.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Miscellaneous Special Forms of Strabismus</p>
			<div id="Chapt12_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Brown Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although it is included in most lists of vertical deviations (see Chapter&#160;11), Brown syndrome is best considered a special form of strabismus. The characteristic restriction of elevation in adduction was originally thought to be caused by shortening of the supposed sheath of the superior oblique tendon. It is now attributed to vari&#173;ous abnormalities of the tendon–&#173;trochlea complex (see Chapter&#160;3), and evidence indicates that structural prob&#173;lems within the orbit but remote from the superior oblique tendon, including instability of the lateral rectus pulley, can pres&#173;ent an identical clinical picture (pseudo–&#173;Brown syndrome). Recent work suggests that congenital Brown syndrome may be a form of CCDD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most cases are congenital. Prominent &#173;causes of the acquired form include trauma in the region of the trochlea, iatrogenic &#173;causes such as scleral buckles and tube shunts, orbital tumors, and systemic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. The latter often results in intermittent Brown syndrome, which may resolve spontaneously. Sinusitis can also lead to Brown syndrome; thus, patients with acute-&#173;onset pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion of Brown syndrome of undetermined cause should undergo imaging of the orbits and paranasal sinuses to investigate this possibility. The condition is bilateral in approximately 10% of cases. Resolution of congenital Brown syndrome has been thought to be unusual, but a report by Dawson and colleagues describes spontaneous improvement in 75% of cases, often &#173;after many years.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single">Dawson E, Barry J, Lee&#160;J. Spontaneous resolution in patients with congenital Brown syndrome. <span class="italic">J AAPOS.</span> 2009;13(2):116–118.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Well-&#173;recognized clinical features of Brown syndrome include deficient elevation in adduction that improves in abduction but often not completely (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-5</span>). Several findings differentiate Brown syndrome from inferior oblique muscle paralysis (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Chapter&#160;11, &#173;Table&#160;11-4</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">An unequivocally positive forced duction test demonstrating restricted passive elevation in adduction is essential for the diagnosis. Retropulsion of the globe during this test stretches the superior oblique tendon and accentuates the restriction. In restrictions involving the inferior rectus muscle or its surrounding tissues, by contrast, the limitation of passive elevation is accentuated by forceps-&#173;induced proptosis of the eye rather than by retropulsion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Attempts at elevation straight upward usually cause divergence (V pattern) due to lateral diversion of the globe as it meets re&#173;sis&#173;tance from the tight superior oblique tendon (see Fig 12-5). This finding is an impor&#173;tant point of distinction from inferior oblique muscle paralysis, which is more likely to exhibit an A pattern. In adduction, the palpebral fissure widens and overdepression in adduction can be observed in severe cases of Brown syndrome (see Chapter&#160;11, &#173;Table&#160;11-2). This differs from overdepression in adduction in true superior oblique muscle overaction, which occurs less abruptly with increasing adduction. In mild Brown syndrome, no hypotropia is pres&#173;ent in primary position. Severe cases of Brown syndrome with a primary position hypotropia are often accompanied by a chin-up head position or a head turn away from the side of the affected eye.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Observation alone is appropriate for mild congenital Brown syndrome. When Brown syndrome is secondary to rheumatoid arthritis or other systemic inflammatory diseases, resolution may occur as systemic treatment brings the under&#173;lying disease into remission or when corticosteroids are injected near the trochlea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgery is indicated for more severe congenital cases. Superior oblique tenotomy nasal to the superior rectus muscle is definitive treatment; however, iatrogenic superior oblique muscle paresis occurs in a significant minority of patients &#173;after this procedure. Careful &#173;handling of the intermuscular septum during surgery can reduce the incidence of this sequela. To reduce the consequences of superior oblique muscle palsy &#173;after tenotomy, some surgeons perform simultaneous ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle weakening. Other current options include insertion of an inert spacer or suture between the cut ends of the superior oblique tendon, and split-&#173;tendon lengthening of the tendon (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14</span>).</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Third Nerve Palsy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In &#173;children, third nerve palsy can be congenital (more appropriately termed <span class="italic">dysinnervation</span>) or can be caused by conditions such as trauma, inflammation, or viral infection. It can also occur as a manifestation of ophthalmoplegic migraine, &#173;after vaccination, or (infrequently) as a result of a neoplastic lesion. In adults, the usual &#173;causes are intracranial aneurysm, microvascular infarction, inflammation, trauma, infection, or tumor. See BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for detailed discussion of the &#173;causes and manifestations of third nerve palsy. This section is concerned primarily with the princi&#173;ples of treatment of the strabismus.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Complete paralysis results in limited adduction, elevation, and depression of the eye, causing exotropia and often hypotropia. &#173;These findings are expected &#173;because the remaining unopposed muscles are the lateral rectus (abductor) and the superior oblique (abductor and depressor), except when the cause of the paralysis involves the nerves supplying &#173;these muscles as well. Upper eyelid ptosis is usually pres&#173;ent, often with pseudoptosis due to the depressed position of the involved eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-6</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical findings and treatment may be complicated by misdirection (aberrant regeneration) of the damaged nerve, presenting as anomalous eyelid elevation, pupil constriction, or vertical excursion of the globe—&#173;any or all of which can occur upon attempted rotation into the field of action of the EOMs supplied by the injured nerve. A miotic pupil is sometimes noted in congenital cases, irrespective of &#173;whether &#173;there is aberrant regeneration. Affected adults report incapacitating diplopia &#173;unless the involved eye is occluded by ptosis or other means.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Except in congenital cases, it is advisable to wait at least 6 months, possibly even up to 12 months, for spontaneous recovery before proceeding with surgical correction. Patients with at least partial recovery are much better candidates for good functional and cosmetic results. &#173;Because the visual system is still developing in pediatric patients, amblyopia is a common finding that must be treated aggressively.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In adults with previously good binocular vision, occlusion from associated ptosis may actually be beneficial by preventing incapacitating diplopia associated with a limited or absent field of single binocular vision; ptosis repair should not be done without prism adaptation testing to demonstrate that the patient can achieve satisfactory binocular vision with prism. The incidence of diplopia in patients younger than 8&#160;years is low &#173;because of suppression (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Chapter&#160;5</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Third nerve palsy pres&#173;ents difficult surgical challenges &#173;because multiple EOMs, including the levator muscle, are involved. Replacing all the lost rotational forces on the globe is impossible; therefore, the goal of surgery is adequate alignment for binocular function in primary position and in slight downgaze for reading.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Se&#173;lection of the surgical procedure is dictated by the number of involved muscles and their condition, as well as by the presence or absence of noticeable paradoxical rotations. In a case of incomplete paralysis, a large recession-&#173;resection of the horizontal rectus muscles to correct the exodeviation, with supraplacement of both to correct the hypotropia, is effective. Some surgeons perform a concurrent superior oblique tenotomy to reduce the hypotropia. For complete paralysis, one suggested approach is a large recession of the lateral rectus muscle, combined with &#173;either a large medial rectus resection or fixation of the globe to the nasal orbital periosteum. Disinsertion of the lateral rectus muscle and reattachment to the lateral orbital periosteum can maximize inactivation of the muscle. Splitting and transposition of the lateral rectus muscle to the nasal side of the globe has also been described. Transfer of the superior oblique tendon to the upper nasal quadrant of the globe has been used as well; however, anomalous eye movements can result from this procedure. Most surgeons reserve correction of ptosis for a subsequent procedure, which allows for more accurate positioning of the upper eyelid.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Fourth Nerve Palsy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Paralysis of cranial nerve IV (trochlear) is discussed in Chapter&#160;11 and BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Sixth Nerve Palsy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Paralysis of cranial nerve VI (abducens) is less common in &#173;children than in adults. This entity is discussed in Chapter&#160;8. See BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for additional discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Thyroid Eye Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Thyroid eye disease (TED) affects the eye and the orbit in vari&#173;ous ways. Only motility disturbances are covered in this volume.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Edema, inflammation, and fibrosis of the EOMs due to lymphocytic infiltration occur in this disease. Not only do &#173;these pathologies restrict motility, but the massively enlarged muscles can cause compressive optic neuropathy. Detection of muscle enlargement by orbital imaging helps confirm the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The myopathy is not caused by thyroid dysfunction. Rather, both conditions prob&#173;ably result from a common autoimmune disease. Thyroid-&#173;stimulating immunoglobulins likely mediate TED and may be regarded as a functional biomarker for this condition. Some patients also have myasthenia gravis (another autoimmune disease, discussed &#173;later in this chapter), complicating the clinical findings. An association between severity of TED and smoking has recently become apparent; the hazard ratio for strabismus surgery is almost double in patients with thyroid disease who smoke.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The muscles affected in TED, in decreasing order of severity and frequency, are the inferior rectus, medial rectus, superior rectus, and lateral rectus. The condition is usually bilateral but is often asymmetric. Forced duction testing almost always shows restriction in one or more directions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most often, the patient pres&#173;ents with some degree of upper eyelid retraction, proptosis, hypotropia, and esotropia (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-7</span>). TED is a common cause of acquired vertical deviation in adults, especially &#173;women, but rarely &#173;causes motility prob&#173;lems in &#173;children.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diplopia and abnormal head position are the principal indications for strabismus surgery. The operation may eliminate diplopia in primary gaze but rarely restores normal motility &#173;because of the restrictive myopathy, the need for large recessions in some cases to place the eye in primary position, and the ongoing under&#173;lying disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is best to perform surgery &#173;after strabismus mea&#173;sure&#173;ments and thyroid function tests have stabilized. In cases in which orbital decompression is necessary, strabismus surgery should be delayed &#173;until &#173;after that has been done. In the meantime, prisms may alleviate diplopia. Botulinum toxin may reduce the severity of fibrosis when injected into tight muscles in the acute phase. In studies of surgery performed before stability was achieved in patients with severe head positions, the results &#173;were favorable, but half the patients required further surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Recession of the affected muscles is the preferred surgical treatment, addressing the tight muscles in 1 or both eyes. Resection procedures usually worsen restriction, but in carefully selected cases they may be helpful as part of the surgical plan. Slight initial undercorrection of hypotropia is desirable &#173;because late progressive overcorrection is common, especially with inferior rectus muscle recessions. Limited depression of the eyes &#173;after inferior rectus muscle recessions can interfere with patients’ bifocal use.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because proptosis and eyelid retraction can increase &#173;after EOM surgery, eyelid surgery is best delayed &#173;until &#173;after all EOM surgery has been completed.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) is a rare form of mitochondrial cytopathy that can affect vari&#173;ous body systems. It usually begins in childhood with ptosis and slowly progresses to total paralysis of the eyelids and EOMs. CPEO may be sporadic or familial. Although a true pigmentary ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophy is rare, constricted visual fields and electrodiagnostic abnormalities can occur. The diagnosis of CPEO is confirmed when muscle biopsy results show ragged red fibers or when specific alterations of mitochondrial DNA are detected. <span class="italic">Kearns-&#173;Sayre syndrome</span> is characterized by ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigmentary changes, CPEO, and cardiomyopathy (especially heart block).</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is impor&#173;tant to ensure that the patient’s cardiac status is evaluated, &#173;because life-&#173;threatening arrhythmias can occur in Kearns-&#173;Sayre syndrome. Treatment options for the ocular motility disorder are limited; small surgical series report a high rate of long-&#173;term undercorrections. Cautious surgical elevation (suspension) of the upper eyelids can lessen a severe chin-up head position.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Myasthenia Gravis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Myasthenia gravis is a disorder in which antibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors cause muscle dysfunction. Onset in childhood is uncommon. A transient neonatal form, caused by the placental transfer of acetylcholine receptor antibodies of &#173;mothers with myasthenia gravis, exists but usually subsides rapidly. Another variant is not immune mediated and exhibits a familial predisposition.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The disease may be purely ocular. In its most severe form, it frequently occurs as part of a major systemic disorder that involves other skeletal muscles, especially in patients who have not received immunosuppressive therapy. Generalization to systemic myasthenia is less common in childhood-&#173;onset ocular myasthenia than in the adult-&#173;onset form.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for an in-&#173;depth discussion of the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, along with its ocular and systemic aspects. Additional information is available on the website of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of Amer&#173;i&#173;ca (<a href="http://www.myasthenia.org"><span class="Hyperlink">www.myasthenia.org</span></a>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The principal ocular manifestation of myasthenia gravis is weakening of the EOMs, including the levator muscle. Most cases (90%) exhibit both ptosis and limited ocular rotations (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 12-8</span>). The ocular signs can resemble &#173;those of any unilateral or bilateral ophthalmoplegia, including internuclear ophthalmoplegia.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;12-1</span> compares the features of TED with &#173;those of CPEO and myasthenia gravis.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-11">Ortiz S, Borchert&#160;M. Long-&#173;term outcomes of pediatric ocular myasthenia gravis. <span class="italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2008;115(7):1245–1248.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A full discussion of treatment of the vari&#173;ous forms of myasthenia gravis is beyond the scope of this chapter. In adults, the ocular manifestations are frequently resistant to the usual systemic myasthenia treatment. However, pediatric ocular myasthenia is often successfully managed with pyridostigmine alone. In adults and &#173;children in whom the ocular deviation has stabilized, standard eye muscle surgery can help restore binocular function in at least some gaze positions. Ptosis occasionally requires surgical repair.</p>
			<p class="h2">Esotropia and Hypotropia Associated With High Myopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In highly myopic patients, extremely increased axial length can cause the elongated globe to herniate between the superior and lateral rectus muscles. High-&#173;resolution MRI studies have shown stretching and dehiscence of the intermuscular septum between &#173;these 2&#160;muscles. They have also demonstrated inferior slippage of the lateral rectus pulley and other supporting tissues, along with medial displacement of the superior rectus. &#173;These anomalies cause a progressively worsening hypotropia and esotropia. The medial rectus is often tight, exacerbating the severity of the esotropia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vari&#173;ous surgical procedures have been devised to overcome the defect by stabilizing the position of the lateral rectus muscle. An effective option is a joining of the superior and lateral rectus muscles, usually with a nonabsorbable suture, to reposition the globe. Recession of the medial rectus muscle may also be necessary if the muscle is tight.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The anatomical and functional features of the <span class="italic">medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF)</span> are discussed in BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span> The MLF integrates the nuclei of the cranial nerves governing ocular motility and has major connections with the vestibular nuclei. An intact MLF is essential for production of conjugate eye movements. Lesions of the MLF result in a typical pattern of dysconjugate movement called <span class="italic">internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO).</span> Abnormalities of this pathway are frequently seen in patients with demyelinating disease, but they may also occur in patients who have had cerebrovascular accidents or brain tumors.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">On horizontal versions, the eye ipsilateral to the MLF lesion adducts slowly and incompletely or not at all, whereas the abducting eye exhibits a characteristic horizontal jerk nystagmus (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Chapter&#160;13</span>). Both eyes adduct normally on convergence. Skew deviation may be pres&#173;ent, in addition to exotropia.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If exotropia persists, medial rectus muscle resection and unilateral or contralateral lateral rectus muscle recession (to limit exotropia in lateral gaze) can help eliminate diplopia, particularly in bilateral cases.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Ocular Motor Apraxia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ocular motor apraxia, also known as <span class="italic">saccadic initiation failure,</span> is a rare supranuclear disorder of ocular motility, sometimes including strabismus. The congenital form may be familial, most commonly autosomal dominant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This condition has been associated with premature birth and developmental delay. Bilateral lesions of the frontoparietal cortex, agenesis of the corpus callosum, hydrocephalus, and Joubert syndrome (abnormal eye movements, developmental delay, &#173;microcephaly, hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal dysplasia, among several anomalies) also have been associated with the condition, as have type 3 Gaucher disease and ataxia-&#173;telangiectasia. Several case reports have identified mass lesions of the cerebellum that compress the rostral part of the brainstem. Neurodevelopmental evaluation and imaging of the brain are advisable for assessment of &#173;children with ocular motor apraxia, especially if &#173;there is an associated vertical apraxia. The differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor apraxia includes conditions that affect the generation of voluntary saccades, including metabolic and degenerative diseases such as Huntington chorea.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-10">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In ocular motor apraxia, normal voluntary horizontal saccades cannot be generated. Instead, changes in horizontal fixation are accomplished by a head thrust that overshoots the target, followed by a rotation of the head back in the opposite direction once fixation is established. The initial thrust serves to break fixation; an associated blink serves the same purpose. Vertical saccades and random eye movements are intact, but horizontal vestibular and optokinetic nystagmus are impaired. The head thrust may improve in late childhood. See also BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Superior Oblique Myokymia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Superior oblique myokymia is a rare entity whose cause is poorly understood. Some evidence indicates that it is caused by ephaptic transmission between fourth cranial nerve fibers perhaps due, in some cases, to damage by vascular compression.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In superior oblique myokymia, &#173;there are abnormal torsional movements of the eye that cause diplopia and monocular oscillopsia. Usually, patients are other&#173;wise neurologically normal. Recurrences may persist in&#173;def&#173;initely.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment is not necessary if the patient is not disturbed by the visual symptoms. Vari&#173;ous systemic medi&#173;cations (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, propranolol, baclofen, gabapentin) and topical timolol have produced inconsistent results but have been advocated as first-&#173;line treatment &#173;because some patients &#173;will benefit, at least in the short term. Effective surgical treatment requires that the superior oblique muscle be disconnected from the globe by generous tenectomy. &#173;Because this typically results in a superior oblique palsy, some surgeons perform simultaneous inferior oblique muscle weakening.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-12">Williams PE, Purvin VA, Kawasaki&#160;A. Superior oblique myokymia: efficacy of medical treatment. <span class="italic">J AAPOS.</span> 2007;11(3):254–257.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Strabismus Associated With Other Ocular Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Refractive surgery that produces monovision, facilitating visual clarity at distance and near without optical aids (performed mainly in adults of presbyopic age; see BCSC Section&#160;13, <span class="italic">Refractive Surgery</span>), can result in dissimilar sensory input to the 2 eyes. The dissimilarity can impair motor fusion, particularly in patients with marginally controlled heterophorias.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal distortion due to an epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane or &#173;after ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment repair can also distort the ret&#173;i&#173;nal image (metamorphopsia, micropsia, or macropsia) to impair motor or sensory fusion. The diplopia rarely improves with surgery for the epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane; fogging the eye with a translucent filter or tape (Bangerter; Ryser Optik AG, St Gallen, Switzerland) is the main treatment option.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">dragged-&#173;fovea diplopia syndrome</span> occurs when an epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane displaces the fovea, placing foveal fusion in conflict with peripheral fusion. Prism and alternate cover testing shows a small heterotropia corresponding to the foveal displacement. But &#173;under binocular conditions, that prism eliminates the diplopia only briefly, &#173;until a fusion movement brings the peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nae back into alignment. Treatment involves fogging the eye, sometimes in combination with a small amount of prism.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgery for ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment can lead to restricted rotations and scarring from dissection of the EOMs and the application of devices (such as a scleral buckle) required to bring about reattachment (see BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Ret&#173;ina and Vitreous</span>). Surgical correction of the resultant strabismus is often difficult. Consultation with a ret&#173;ina surgeon is recommended if removal of a scleral buckle is contemplated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tube shunts are another potential source of scarring and interference with ocular rotations (see BCSC Section&#160;10, <span class="italic">Glaucoma</span>). Treatment may require removal, relocation, or substitution of the device, which creates a dilemma if it has been functioning well.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The EOMs can be damaged from retrobulbar injections, &#173;either by direct injury to the muscles or from toxicity of the injected material. &#173;Because of the usual site of &#173;these injections, the vertical rectus muscles are the most vulnerable.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Injection of botulinum toxin into the eyelids can result in diffusion of this substance and a transient paralyzing effect on any of the EOMs.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Laceration or inadvertent excision of an entire section of the medial rectus muscle is one of several serious ocular and orbital complications of pterygium removal or endoscopic sinus surgery. Restoration of function can be an extremely difficult surgical challenge.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Conjunctival scarring and symblepharon can also result in restrictive strabismus &#173;after pterygium surgery or other surgery or trauma involving the conjunctiva, particularly in the lateral canthal area. Treatment involves lysis or excision of the fibrotic band. The resulting defect can be managed with conjunctival recession, conjunctival transposition, or an amniotic membrane graft.</p>
