			<p class="chapter-title">Amblyopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Amblyopia is a unilateral or, less commonly, bilateral reduction of best-&#173;corrected visual acuity (also referred to as <span class="italic">corrected distance visual acuity</span>) that cannot be attributed directly to the effect of any structural abnormality of the eye or visual pathways. Ambly&#173;opia signifies a failure of normal neural development in the immature visual system (see Chapter&#160;5) and is caused by abnormal visual experience early in life resulting from one or a combination of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">strabismus</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">refractive error: anisometropia or bilateral high refractive error (isoametropia)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">visual deprivation in 1 or both eyes</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h1">Epidemiology</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top1"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Amblyopia is responsible for more cases of childhood-&#173;onset unilateral decreased vision than all other &#173;causes combined, with a prevalence of 2%–4% in North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca. It is also the most common cause of unilateral visual impairment in adults younger than 60&#160;years. Amblyopia prevalence is increased in the setting of prematurity, developmental delay, or &#173;family history of amblyopia.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Pathophysiology</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top2"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In early postnatal development, &#173;there are critical periods of cortical development during which neural cir&#173;cuits display a heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli and are dependent on natu&#173;ral sensory experience for proper formation (see also Chapter&#160;5). During these periods, the developing visual system is vulnerable to abnormal input due to visual deprivation, strabismus, or significant blur resulting from anisometropia or isoametropia. Conversely, the visual system’s plasticity early in development allows the greatest opportunity for amblyopia reversal. The win&#173;dow of opportunity for treatment depends on the type of amblyopia (see the next section, Classification). For example, the critical period for reversal of visual deprivation amblyopia (eg, due to infantile cataracts) is shorter than that for reversal of infantile strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Amblyopic visual deficits result primarily from visual cortical changes. With abnormal visual experience early in life, cells of the primary visual cortex can lose their ability to respond to stimulation of 1 or both eyes, and the cells that remain responsive show significant functional deficiencies, including abnormally large receptive fields. Visual cortex deficiencies may account for the crowding phenomenon, in which optotypes are easier to recognize when isolated than when surrounded by similar forms (see Chapter&#160;1). Abnormalities are also found in neurons within the lateral geniculate body, but the ret&#173;ina in amblyopia is essentially normal. Amblyopia is primarily a defect of central vision; the peripheral visual field is usually normal.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Classification</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top3"> 
			<p class="h2-h1">Strabismic Amblyopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Strabismic amblyopia results from competitive or inhibitory interaction between neurons carry&#173;ing nonfusible input from the 2 eyes. Constant, nonalternating heterotropias are the most likely deviations to cause amblyopia. The visual cortex becomes dominated by input from the fixating eye, with reduced responsiveness to input from the nonfixating eye. In young &#173;children with strabismus, suppression develops rapidly. This visual adaptation serves to avoid diplopia and visual confusion (see Chapter&#160;5), but in a child who does not alternate fixation, constant suppression of input from the same eye can lead to amblyopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Several features distinguish strabismic amblyopia from other types of amblyopia. <span class="italic">Grating acuity</span> (see Chapter&#160;1), the ability to resolve uniformly spaced stripes, is often reduced less than recognition acuity. Mea&#173;sure&#173;ments obtained with Teller Acuity Cards II (Stereo Optical, Inc, Chicago, IL) and the LEA Grating Acuity Test (Good-&#173;Lite Com&#173;pany, Elgin, IL) may overestimate recognition visual acuity. Visual acuity mea&#173;sured through a neutral density filter declines less sharply for patients with strabismic amblyopia than for &#173;those with ocular disease <span class="italic">(neutral density filter effect).</span></p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Eccentric fixation</span> is the consistent use of a nonfoveal region of the ret&#173;ina during monocular viewing. Minor degrees of eccentric fixation, detectable only with special tests such as visuoscopy, are pres&#173;ent in many patients with strabismic amblyopia. Clinically evident eccentric fixation results in a decentered position of the corneal light reflex when the amblyopic eye is fixating monocularly and implies visual acuity of 20/200 or worse, as well as a poorer prognosis. It should not be confused with an abnormal &#173;angle kappa (see Chapter&#160;7).</p>
			<p class="h2">Refractive Amblyopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Refractive amblyopia results from consistent ret&#173;i&#173;nal defocus in 1 or both eyes. Anisometropia &#173;causes unilateral amblyopia; isoametropia &#173;causes bilateral amblyopia.</p>
			<p class="h3">Anisometropic amblyopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In anisometropic amblyopia, dissimilar refractive errors in the 2 eyes cause 1 ret&#173;i&#173;nal image to be chronically defocused. Considered more prevalent than strabismic amblyopia in some recent US studies, this condition is thought to result partly from the direct effect of image blur and partly from interocular competition or inhibition similar (but not identical) to that responsible for strabismic amblyopia. Levels of anisometropia that commonly lead to amblyopia are greater than 1.50 diopters (D) of anisohyperopia, 2.00 D of anisoastigmatism, and 3.00 D of anisomyopia. Higher levels are associated with greater risk. The eyes of a child with anisometropic amblyopia usually appear normal to the &#173;family and primary care physician, which may delay detection and treatment.</p>

			<p class="h3">Isoametropic amblyopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Isoametropic amblyopia (bilateral ametropic amblyopia) is bilaterally decreased visual acuity resulting from chronically defocused ret&#173;i&#173;nal images, which are due to similarly large uncorrected refractive errors in both eyes. Hyperopia exceeding 4.00–5.00 D and myopia exceeding 5.00–6.00 D are risk &#173;factors. Bilateral high astigmatism may cause loss of resolving ability specific to the chronically blurred meridians <span class="italic">(meridional amblyopia).</span> Most ophthalmologists recommend correction for eyes with more than 2.00–3.00 D of cylinder.</p>
			<p class="h2">Visual Deprivation Amblyopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The least common form of amblyopia, but the most severe and difficult to treat, is visual deprivation amblyopia (also known as <span class="italic">stimulus deprivation amblyopia, deprivation amblyopia, visual stimulus deprivation amblyopia</span>, and <span class="italic">form-&#173;vision deprivation amblyopia</span>), which is due to an eye abnormality that obstructs the visual axis or other&#173;wise interferes with central vision. The most common cause is congenital or early-&#173;acquired cataract; other &#173;causes include blepharoptosis, periocular lesions obstructing the visual axis, corneal opacities, and vitreous hemorrhage. Visual deprivation amblyopia develops faster, and is deeper, than strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia. Unilateral visual deprivation tends to cause vision deficits in the affected eye that are more severe than the bilateral amblyopic deficits produced by bilateral deprivation of the same degree &#173;because interocular competition adds to the direct impact of image degradation (see Chapter&#160;5). Even in bilateral cases, visual acuity can be 20/200 or worse if not treated early.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In &#173;children younger than 6&#160;years, dense cataracts occupying the central 3&#160;mm or more of the lens can cause severe visual deprivation amblyopia. Similar lens opacities acquired &#173;after age 6&#160;years are generally less harmful. Small anterior polar cataracts, around which retinoscopy can be readily performed, and lamellar cataracts, through which a reasonably good view of the fundus can be obtained, may cause mild to moderate amblyopia or have no effect on visual development. Unilateral anterior polar cataracts, however, are associated with anisometropia and subtle optical distortion of the surrounding clear portion of the lens, which may cause anisometropic and/or mild visual deprivation amblyopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Reverse amblyopia</span> (occlusion amblyopia) is a form of visual deprivation amblyopia that can develop in the initially dominant eye if it is patched excessively during treatment of amblyopia in the other eye. See the section “Reverse amblyopia and new strabismus” for further discussion.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Detection and Screening</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top4"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Amblyopia is preventable or reversible with timely detection and intervention. Risk &#173;factors for amblyopia include strabismus, anisometropia, isoametropia, and visual deprivation (eg, from ocular media opacities). Regular childhood screening through primary care or community-&#173;based programs facilitates early detection of amblyopia and amblyopia risk &#173;factors. Screening techniques include direct visual acuity mea&#173;sure&#173;ment and testing for risk &#173;factors. Corneal light reflex tests and cover testing detect strabismus; the Br<span class="accent">ü</span>ckner test (see Chapter&#160;7) can reveal media opacities, strabismus, anisometropia, and isoametropia. Instrument-&#173;based vision screening is effective in preschool-&#173;aged and younger &#173;children: portable autorefractors identify refractive errors, while photoscreening devices detect strabismus, refractive errors, and abnormal red reflexes.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Evaluation</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top5"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Amblyopia is diagnosed when a patient has a condition known to cause amblyopia and has decreased best-&#173;corrected visual acuity that cannot be explained by other diseases of the eye or visual pathways. Vision characteristics alone cannot differentiate amblyopia from other forms of vision loss. The crowding phenomenon, for example, is typical of amblyopia but not pathognomonic or uniformly demonstrable. Subtle afferent pupillary defects may occur in severe amblyopia, but only rarely. Amblyopia sometimes coexists with vision loss that is directly caused by an uncorrectable structural abnormality of the eye such as optic nerve hypoplasia or coloboma. If amblyopia is suspected in such a case, it is appropriate to undertake a trial of amblyopia treatment. Improvement in vision confirms that amblyopia was indeed pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Multiple assessments of visual acuity are sometimes required to determine the presence and severity of amblyopia. (Assessment of visual acuity is discussed in Chapter&#160;1.) In some cases, the clinician may assume that amblyopia is pres&#173;ent and initiate treatment before decreased vision can be demonstrated. For example, if a clinician does not have access to a grating acuity test such as Teller Acuity Cards II, occlusion therapy may be started in a preverbal child in the presence of a high degree of anisometropia or shortly &#173;after surgery for a unilateral cataract.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When determining the severity of amblyopia in a young patient, the clinician should remember that both false-&#173;positive and false-&#173;negative errors may occur with fixation preference testing; a strabismic child may show a strong fixation preference despite having equal visual acuity, whereas an anisometropic child may alternate fixation despite having significant amblyopia. In addition, the young child’s brief attention span frequently results in grating or recognition acuity mea&#173;sure&#173;ments that fall short of the true limits of acuity; &#173;these mea&#173;sure&#173;ments can mimic &#173;those of bilateral amblyopia or mask or falsely suggest a significant interocular difference. Fi&#173;nally, &#173;because test-&#173;retest variability can be up to a full line of letters in &#173;children, it is impor&#173;tant for the clinician to evaluate trends when assessing response to treatment.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Treatment</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top6"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of amblyopia involves the following steps:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;Eliminate (if needed) any obstruction of the visual axis, such as a cataract.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;Correct any significant refractive error.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;Promote use of the amblyopic eye.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Cataract Removal</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataracts capable of producing dense amblyopia require timely surgery. Removal of unilateral, visually significant congenital lens opacities within the first 6 weeks of life is necessary for optimal recovery of vision. In young &#173;children, significant cataracts with uncertain time of onset also deserve prompt and aggressive treatment if recent development is at least a possibility. For bilateral, dense congenital cataracts, surgery is recommended within the first 10 weeks of life. However, small partial cataracts may sometimes be managed nonsurgically; pharmacologic pupillary dilation may permit good vision despite a central opacity (see also the section Visual Deprivation Amblyopia, earlier in the chapter). Childhood cataract is discussed further in Chapter&#160;23.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Refractive Correction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Refractive correction plays a key role in the treatment of all types of amblyopia, not just refractive amblyopia. Anisometropic, isoametropic, and even strabismic amblyopia may improve or resolve with refractive correction alone. Many ophthalmologists thus initiate amblyopia treatment with refractive correction, adding occlusion or pharmacologic or optical treatment &#173;later if necessary (see the following sections). Refractive correction for aphakia following cataract surgery in childhood is initiated promptly to avoid prolonging visual deprivation. For patients with high refractive error that is amblyogenic who will not or cannot wear glasses or contact lenses, refractive surgery may be an alternative in select cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, refractive correction in amblyopia should be based on the cycloplegic refraction. Often, full hyperopic correction is necessary to treat coexisting accommodative esotropia (see Chapter&#160;8). Furthermore, &#173;because an amblyopic eye tends to have an impaired ability to control accommodation, it cannot reliably compensate for uncorrected hyperopia as would a child’s normal eye. Thus, &#173;children with unilateral or bilateral amblyopia may need full or nearly full correction of their hyperopia during amblyopia treatment even if they do not have accommodative esotropia. Also, by ensuring clear distance vision in the fellow eye even &#173;under cycloplegia, full hyperopic correction may reduce the risk of reverse amblyopia, which can result from pharmacologic treatment with atropine (see the section “Reverse amblyopia and new strabismus”). Sometimes, however, symmetric reductions in plus-&#173;lens power help foster ac&#173;cep&#173;tance of glasses.</p>

Optical treatment of strabismic and combined strabismic-&#173;anisometropic amblyopia. <span class="italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2012;119(1):150–158.</p>
			<p class="h2">Occlusion Therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Occlusion therapy (patching) is commonly used to treat unilateral amblyopia. The sound eye is covered, obligating the child to use the amblyopic eye. Adhesive patches are usually employed, but spectacle-&#173;mounted occluders or opaque contact lenses are alternatives if skin irritation or inadequate adhesion is a prob&#173;lem. With spectacle-&#173;mounted occluders, close supervision is necessary to ensure that the patient does not peek around the occluder.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Full-&#173;time occlusion,</span> defined as occlusion during all waking hours, can cause reverse amblyopia and strabismus (see the section Complications and Challenges of Therapy). For severe amblyopia, <span class="italic">part-&#173;time occlusion</span> of 6 hours per day achieves results similar to &#173;those obtained with prescribed full-&#173;time occlusion. The relative duration of patch-on and patch-&#173;off intervals should reflect the degree of amblyopia. For severe deficits (visual acuity of 20/125–20/400), 6 hours per day is preferred. For moderate deficits (visual acuity of 20/100 or better), 2 hours of daily patching may be effective. It is not necessary for the patient to engage in specific activities (eg, near work) while patched.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Follow-up timing depends on patient age and treatment intensity. Part-&#173;time treatment permits less frequent follow-&#173;up; reexamination 2–3 months &#173;after initiating treatment is typical. Subsequent visits can be at longer intervals, based on early response.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The desired endpoint of therapy for unilateral amblyopia is &#173;free alternation of fixation and/or linear recognition acuity that differs by no more than 1 line between the 2 eyes. The time required to complete treatment depends on amblyopia severity, treatment intensity, and patient adherence and age. More severe amblyopia and older &#173;children require more intensive or longer treatment. Occlusion during infancy may reverse substantial strabismic amblyopia in less than 1 month. In contrast, an older child who wears a patch only &#173;after school and on weekends may require several months to overcome a moderate deficit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adherence to occlusion therapy for amblyopia declines with increasing age. However, studies in older &#173;children and teen&#173;agers with strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia show that treatment can still be beneficial beyond the first de&#173;cade of life. This is especially true in &#173;children who have not previously under&#173;gone treatment.</p>
			<p class="h2">Pharmacologic or Optical Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Alternatives to occlusion therapy involve pharmacologic and/or optical degradation of the better eye’s vision such that it becomes temporarily inferior to the amblyopic eye’s vision, promoting use of the amblyopic eye. For patients with orthotropia or small-&#173;angle strabismus, an advantage of &#173;these treatments over occlusion therapy is that they allow a degree of binocularity, which is particularly beneficial in &#173;children with latent nystagmus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pharmacologic treatment of moderate amblyopia (visual acuity of 20/100 or better) is as effective as patching and may also be successful in more severe amblyopia (visual acuity of 20/125–20/400), particularly in younger &#173;children. A cycloplegic agent (usually atropine sulfate solution, 1%) is administered to the better-&#173;seeing eye so that it is unable to accommodate. Vision in the better eye is thus blurred at near and, if hyperopia is undercorrected, also for distance viewing. Atropine may be administered daily, but weekend administration is as effective for milder amblyopia. Regular follow-up is impor&#173;tant to monitor for reverse amblyopia (see the section Complications and Challenges of Therapy).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pharmacologic treatment is difficult for the child to thwart. It may not work well for myopic patients, however, &#173;because clear near vision persists in the dominant eye despite cycloplegia if the distance correction is not worn. In some &#173;children, attempts to accommodate with the dominant eye in the face of cycloplegia can increase accommodative convergence, worsening any under&#173;lying esotropia during treatment. Parents and caregivers should be counseled regarding the adverse effects of atropine, including light sensitivity, and potential systemic toxicity, the symptoms of which include fever, tachycardia, delirium, and dry mouth and skin (see Chapter&#160;1).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Optical treatment involves the prescription of excessive plus lenses (fogging) or diffusing filters for the sound eye. This form of treatment avoids potential pharmacologic adverse effects and may be able to induce greater blur than cycloplegic agents. If the child wears glasses, a translucent filter, such as Scotch Magic Tape (3M, St Paul, MN) or a Bangerter foil (Ryser Optik AG, St Gallen, Switzerland), can be applied to the spectacle lens. Optical treatment may be more acceptable than occlusion therapy to many &#173;children and their parents, but patients must be closely monitored to ensure proper use (no peeking) of spectacle-&#173;borne devices.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Binocular Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Binocular amblyopia treatments have recently shown some promise in amblyopic &#173;children with orthotropia or small-&#173;angle strabismus. In &#173;these treatments, the child engages in active or passive visual tasks that require simultaneous perception and are performed on an electronic device &#173;under dichoptic viewing conditions. The relative salience of amblyopic and fellow eye input can be adjusted over the course of treatment.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Complications and Challenges of Therapy</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Reverse amblyopia and new strabismus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Both occlusion therapy and pharmacologic treatment carry a risk of overtreatment, which can result in reverse amblyopia in the sound eye. Strabismus can also develop or worsen with amblyopia treatment (although strabismus can also improve with amblyopia treatment).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Full-&#173;time occlusion carries the greatest risk of reverse amblyopia and thus requires close monitoring. Consequently, most ophthalmologists do not use full-&#173;time occlusion in younger &#173;children. &#173;Children with binocular fusion, especially, may benefit from time spent viewing binocularly. The &#173;family of a strabismic child should be instructed to watch for a reversal of fixation preference with full-&#173;time occlusion and to report its occurrence promptly. Usually, iatrogenic reverse amblyopia can be treated successfully with judicious patching of the formerly better-&#173;seeing eye or by alternating occlusion. Sometimes, simply stopping treatment leads to equalization of vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">During pharmacologic treatment, the risk of reverse amblyopia is greatest if daily treatment is coupled with undercorrection of hyperopic refractive error in the sound eye undergoing cycloplegia (see the section Refractive Correction, earlier in the chapter).</p>
			<p class="h3">Poor adherence</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lack of adherence to the therapeutic regimen is a common prob&#173;lem that can prolong the treatment period or lead to outright failure. If difficulties derive from a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar treatment method, the clinician should seek a suitable alternative. Adhesive and cloth patches may not be covered by medical insurance in the United States; if treatment cost is a burden, pharmacologic treatment may facilitate adherence. If the skin becomes irritated from patch adhesives, switching to a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent brand or applying skin lotion &#173;after patching may help. A barrier application of tincture of benzoin can protect the skin from contact with adhesive and help when patches do not adhere &#173;because of perspiration; however, it can make patch removal more traumatic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Families who seem to lack sufficient motivation should be counseled concerning the importance of the therapy and the need for consistency in carry&#173;ing it out. They can be reassured that once an appropriate routine is established, the daily effort required is likely to diminish, especially if the amblyopia improves. For an older child, it can also be helpful for the physician to explain and emphasize the importance of treatment adherence directly to the child in an age-&#173;appropriate manner. Further, it is impor&#173;tant for the &#173;family to understand that amblyopia treatment is performed primarily to improve vision rather than ocular alignment (even though ocular alignment may sometimes improve) and, conversely, that improving ocular alignment (with surgery or glasses) does not obviate the need for treatment of associated amblyopia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Adherence to a patching regimen in older &#173;children can be improved by creating goals and offering rewards or by linking patching to play activities (eg, decorating the patch or patching while the child plays a video game). For infants and toddlers, adherence to a patching regimen depends greatly on parental engagement and commitment. Arm splints and mittens are sometimes used as a last resort.</p>
			<p class="h3">Unresponsiveness</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sometimes even conscientious application of an appropriate therapeutic program fails to improve vision at all or beyond a certain level. Complete or partial unresponsiveness to treatment occasionally affects younger &#173;children but more often occurs in patients older than 5&#160;years. When &#173;there is a significant deviation from the expected treatment response despite good adherence, reexamination may reveal subtle optic nerve or ret&#173;i&#173;nal anomalies. Neuroimaging may be considered if an occult compressive optic neuropathy is suspected.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In a prognostically unfavorable situation, decisions about treatment should take into account the patient’s and parents’ wishes. Amblyopia is not always fully correctable, even in younger &#173;children. Primary therapy may reasonably be terminated if &#173;there is a lack of demonstrable pro&#173;gress over 3–6 months despite good treatment adherence. Pro&#173;gress or lack thereof may be harder to quantify in preverbal &#173;children, however, so longer treatment is appropriate in this setting.</p>
			<p class="h3">Recurrence</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When amblyopia treatment is discontinued &#173;after complete or partial improvement of vision, up to one-&#173;third of patients show some degree of recurrence. Reducing the occlusion regimen (to 1–2 hours per day) or the frequency of pharmacologic treatment for a few months before cessation is associated with a decreased incidence of recurrence, although no randomized trial has compared tapered and nontapered cessation. If recurrence occurs, vision can usually be improved again with resumption of therapy. In a study of &#173;children who &#173;were between 7 and 12&#160;years of age when treated for amblyopia, the vision improvements that occurred seemed to be mostly sustained &#173;after cessation of treatment other than spectacles. Younger patients may require periodic monitoring &#173;until vision is stable with spectacle treatment alone (eg, &#173;until age 8–10&#160;years).
