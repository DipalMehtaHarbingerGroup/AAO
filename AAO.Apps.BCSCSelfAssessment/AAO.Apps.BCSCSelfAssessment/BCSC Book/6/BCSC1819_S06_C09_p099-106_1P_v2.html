			<p class="chapter-title">Exodeviations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An exodeviation is a manifest (exotropia) or latent (exophoria) divergent strabismus. Risk &#173;factors for exotropia include maternal substance abuse and smoking during pregnancy, premature birth, perinatal morbidity, ge&#173;ne&#173;tic anomalies, &#173;family history of strabismus, and uncorrected refractive errors.</p>
			<p class="h1">Pseudoexotropia</p>
					<div id="Chapt9_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">pseudoexotropia</span> refers to an appearance of exodeviation when in fact the eyes are properly aligned. Pseudoexotropia is much less common than pseudoesotropia (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;8 for discussion of pseudoesotropia</span>) and may occur when &#173;there is a wide interpupillary distance or a positive &#173;angle kappa with or without other ocular abnormalities (see the discussions of &#173;angle kappa in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7</span> of this volume and in BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics</span>).</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Exophoria</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Exophoria is an exodeviation controlled by fusion &#173;under normal binocular viewing conditions. An exophoria is detected when binocular vision is interrupted, as during an alternate cover test or monocular visual acuity testing. Exophoria is relatively common, and patients are usually asymptomatic, although with prolonged near work, they may experience asthenopia. Decompensation of an exophoria to an exotropia may occur when the patient is ill or &#173;under the influence of sedatives or alcohol. Treatment is recommended when an exophoria becomes symptomatic.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Intermittent Exotropia</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intermittent exotropia is the most common type of manifest exodeviation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Clinical Characteristics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The onset of intermittent exotropia is usually before age 5&#160;years, and the exotropia typically continues into adulthood. The exodeviation becomes manifest during times of visual inattention, fatigue, stress, or illness. Parents of affected &#173;children often report that the exotropia occurs late in the day or when the child is daydreaming or tired. Exposure to bright light often &#173;causes exodeviation and a reflex closure of 1 eye (which is why strabismus is sometimes referred to as a “squint”).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Exodeviations are usually larger when the patient views distant targets, and they may be difficult to elicit at near. &#173;Because most parental interactions with young &#173;children occur at near, parents of a child with intermittent exotropia may not notice it initially. Intermittent exotropia can be associated with small hypertropias, A and V patterns (see Chapter&#160;10), and overelevation and underelevation in adduction (see Chapter&#160;11).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Left untreated, intermittent exotropia may remain stable, resolve, or pro&#173;gress, sometimes to constant exotropia. &#173;Because of suppression, &#173;children younger than 10&#160;years with intermittent exotropia rarely report diplopia. They retain normal ret&#173;i&#173;nal correspondence and good binocular function when orthotropic. Amblyopia may occur if the strabismus is poorly controlled or becomes constant. Adults with poorly controlled intermittent or constant exotropia often experience significant psychological stress, anxiety, and depression &#173;because of their strabismus. Adults with strabismus often report reduced quality of life, obtain lower levels of education, and may have limited &#173;career choices and advancement opportunities.</p>
			<p class="h2">Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinical evaluation begins with a history, including the age at onset of the strabismus, frequency and duration of misalignment, circumstances &#173;under which the deviation is manifest, and &#173;whether the exotropia is becoming more frequent with time. The clinician should determine &#173;whether symptoms such as diplopia, asthenopia, or difficulty with interpersonal interactions secondary to ocular misalignment are pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Exodeviation control may be categorized as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Good control:</span> Exotropia manifests only &#173;after cover testing, and the patient resumes fusion rapidly without blinking or refixating.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Fair control:</span> Exotropia manifests &#173;after fusion is disrupted by cover testing, and the patient resumes fusion only &#173;after blinking or refixating.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">Poor control:</span> Exotropia manifests spontaneously and may remain manifest for an extended time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Some ophthalmologists use the Newcastle Control Score for Intermittent Exotropia to quantitatively grade the control exhibited by patients with this deviation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because visual acuity and alignment tests are dissociating and may adversely affect assessment of strabismus control, they should be performed &#173;after sensory tests for stereopsis and fusion. Prism and alternate cover testing should be used to evaluate the exodeviation at fixation distances of 6&#160;m and 33&#160;cm. A far-&#173;distance mea&#173;sure&#173;ment at 30&#160;m or greater (eg, at the end of a long hallway or out a win&#173;dow) may uncover a latent deviation or elicit an even larger one. The deviation at near fixation is often smaller than the deviation at distance fixation. This difference is usually due to <span class="italic">tenacious proximal fusion,</span> a slow-&#173;to-&#173;dissipate fusion mechanism at near. The difference may sometimes be due to a high accommodative convergence/accommodation (AC/A) ratio, but a high AC/A ratio occurs much less commonly in exotropia than in esotropia (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7, which discusses</span> mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of AC/A ratios). The exodeviation is termed <span class="italic">basic intermittent exotropia</span> when the size of the deviation at distance fixation is within 10 prism diopters (<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span><span class="greek--tx-">)</span> of the deviation size at near fixation. Some &#173;children have a larger deviation at near than at distance; this is distinct from convergence insufficiency (discussed &#173;later in the chapter).</p>
			<p class="body-text">When the exodeviation at distance is larger than the deviation at near fixation by 10<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span> or more, the near exodeviation should be remea&#173;sured &#173;after 1 eye is occluded for 30–60&#160;minutes (the patch test). The patch test eliminates the effects of tenacious proximal fusion, helping distinguish between pseudodivergence excess and true divergence excess. A patient with pseudodivergence excess has similar distance and near mea&#173;sure&#173;ments &#173;after the patch test. A patient with true divergence excess continues to have a significantly larger exodeviation at distance. Many patients with true divergence excess also have a high AC/A ratio. For &#173;these patients, the AC/A ratio can be determined by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the near deviation with and without <span class="symbol">+</span>3.00 diopter (D) lenses (while the patient wears corrective lenses, if necessary), &#173;after the patch test is completed. The mea&#173;sure&#173;ments are then compared. Alternatively, the distance deviation can be mea&#173;sured with and without <span class="symbol">−</span>2.00 D lenses to determine the AC/A ratio.</p>

			<p class="h2">Treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All patients with exodeviations should be monitored as some &#173;will require treatment. Opinions vary widely regarding the timing of surgery and the use of nonsurgical treatments. Patients who have well-&#173;controlled, asymptomatic intermittent exotropia and good binocular fusion can be observed. Untreated strabismus often results in poor self-&#173;esteem in adults and &#173;children. Adults with strabismus report a wide range of difficulties with social interactions, which improve significantly &#173;after surgery.</p>
			<p class="h3">Nonsurgical management</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Correction of refractive errors</span> Corrective lenses should be prescribed for significant refractive errors. Correction of even mild myopia may improve control of the exodeviation. Mild-&#173;to-&#173;moderate degrees of hyperopia are not routinely corrected in &#173;children with intermittent exotropia &#173;because refractive correction may worsen the deviation. &#173;Children with marked hyperopia (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span><span class="symbol">+</span>4.00 D) may be unable to sustain accommodation, which results in a blurred ret&#173;i&#173;nal image and manifest exotropia. In &#173;these patients, correction of refractive errors with glasses or contacts may improve ret&#173;i&#173;nal image clarity and help control the exodeviation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some cases, overcorrection of myopia by 2.00–4.00 D can stimulate accommodative convergence to help control the exodeviation. It can be effective as a temporizing mea&#173;sure to promote fusion and delay surgery in &#173;children with an immature visual system. This therapy may cause asthenopia in school-&#173;aged &#173;children, however. For patients whose initial overcorrection results in control, the prescription can be gradually tapered and surgery may be avoided.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Occlusion therapy</span> Occlusion therapy (patching) for amblyopia may improve exotropic deviations. For patients without amblyopia, part-&#173;time patching of the dominant (nondeviating) eye or alternate patching (alternating which eye is patched each day) in the absence of a strong ocular preference can improve control of small-&#173; to moderate-&#173;sized deviations, particularly in young &#173;children. The improvement is often temporary, however, and many patients eventually require surgery.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Prisms</span> Although they can be used to promote fusion in intermittent exotropia, base-in prisms are seldom chosen for long-&#173;term management &#173;because they can cause a reduction in fusional vergence amplitudes.</p>
			<p class="h3">Surgical treatment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Factors influencing the decision to proceed with surgery include strabismus that is frequently manifest, poorly controlled, worsening (especially at near), symptomatic; poor self-&#173;image; and difficulty with personal or professional relationships. Strabismus surgery in adults is reconstructive, not cosmetic, and may alleviate anxiety and depression in some patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgical treatment of exotropia typically consists of bilateral lateral rectus muscle recession or unilateral lateral rectus muscle recession combined with medial rectus muscle resection. Large (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span>50<span class="greek--tx- CharOverride-1">d</span>) deviations may require surgery on 3 or 4 muscles; for small deviations, single-&#173;muscle recession is sometimes performed. The optimal age for surgery and the choice of procedure are debatable. Caution is advised when surgery is considered for patients with true divergence excess exotropia, as they are at risk for postoperative diplopia and esotropia at near.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Postoperative alignment</span> A small-&#173;angle esotropia in the immediate postoperative period tends to resolve and is desirable &#173;because of its association with a reduced risk of recurrent exotropia. Patients may experience diplopia while esotropic, and they should be advised of this possibility preoperatively. An esodeviation that persists beyond 3–4 weeks or that develops 1–2 months &#173;after surgery <span class="italic">(postsurgical esotropia)</span> may need further treatment, such as hyperopic correction, base-&#173;out prisms, patching to prevent amblyopia, or additional surgery. Bifocal glasses can be used for a high AC/A ratio and should be discussed preoperatively with patients who have true divergence excess. &#173;Unless deficient ductions suggest a slipped or “lost” muscle, a delay of a few months is recommended before reoperation for postsurgical esotropia, as spontaneous improvement may occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because of the possibility of per&#173;sis&#173;tent consecutive esodeviations, some ophthalmo&#173;logists prefer to delay surgery in young &#173;children who have good preoperative visual acuity and stereopsis. &#173;Others, however, consider surgical delay a risk &#173;factor for recurrence of strabismus. Long-&#173;term follow-up studies of the effectiveness of surgical treatment of intermittent exotropia show high recurrence rates. Patients may require multiple surgeries to maintain ocular alignment long term.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Convergence Insufficiency</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Convergence insufficiency (CI) is an exodeviation that is greater at near fixation than at distance fixation. It is characterized by poor fusional convergence amplitudes and a remote near point of convergence (normal fusional vergence amplitudes are given in Chapter&#160;7, &#173;Table&#160;7-1). This sometimes results in symptoms of asthenopia, blurred near vision, and diplopia during near work, usually in older &#173;children or adults. Convergence insufficiency is a common complication of Parkinson disease. Rarely, accommodative spasms occur when accommodation and convergence are stimulated in an effort to overcome the CI.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of symptomatic CI typically involves orthoptic exercises. Base-&#173;out prisms can be used to stimulate and strengthen fusional convergence amplitudes. Stereograms, “pencil push-&#173;ups,” and computer-&#173;based or office-&#173;based convergence training programs are all &#173;viable options. If &#173;these exercises fail, base-in prism reading glasses may alleviate symptoms. Surgical treatment, usually medial rectus muscle resection, may be indicated in patients whose prob&#173;lems persist despite medical therapy.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-2">Constant Exotropia</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Constant exotropia is encountered most often in older patients with sensory exotropia or in patients with a history of long-&#173;standing intermittent exotropia, which has decompensated. Constant exotropia also occurs in persons with infantile or consecutive exotropia. A patient with an exotropia that is constant can have basic, pseudodivergence excess, or true divergence excess exotropia—&#173;the same forms seen in intermittent exotropia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgical treatment is the same as that for intermittent exotropia, discussed earlier in the chapter.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some patients with constant exotropia have an enlarged field of peripheral vision &#173;because they have large areas of nonoverlapping visual fields. &#173;These patients may notice a field constriction when the eyes are straightened.</p>
			<p class="h2">Infantile Exotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infantile exotropia is much less common than infantile esotropia. Constant infantile exotropia is apparent before age 6 months as a large-&#173;angle deviation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-1</span>). The risk of amblyopia is higher in constant exotropia than in intermittent exotropia. Although infants with constant exotropia may be other&#173;wise healthy, the risk of associated neurologic impairment or craniofacial disorders is increased in &#173;these patients. A careful developmental history is thus impor&#173;tant, and referral for neurologic assessment should be considered if &#173;there are indications of developmental delay. Patients with constant infantile exotropia are operated on early in life, and outcomes are similar to &#173;those for infantile esotropia (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;8</span>). Early surgery can lead to monofixation with gross binocular vision, but restoration of normal binocular function is rare. Dissociated vertical deviations and overelevation in adduction may develop (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;11</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Sensory Exotropia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Esotropia or exotropia may develop as a result of any condition that severely reduces vision or the visual field in 1 eye. It is not known why some individuals become esotropic and &#173;others exotropic &#173;after unilateral vision loss. In addition, although both sensory esotropia and sensory exotropia occur in infants and young &#173;children, the latter predominates in older &#173;children and adults. If the vision in the exotropic eye can be improved, peripheral fusion may be reestablished &#173;after surgical realignment, provided the sensory exotropia has not been pres&#173;ent for an extended period. Loss of fusional abilities, known as <span class="italic">central fusion disruption,</span> can lead to constant and permanent diplopia despite anatomical realignment when adult-&#173;onset sensory exotropia has been pres&#173;ent for several years before vision rehabilitation.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Consecutive Exotropia</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Exotropia that occurs &#173;after a period of esotropia is called <span class="italic">consecutive exotropia.</span> Rarely, exotropia may develop spontaneously in a patient who was previously esotropic and never underwent strabismus surgery. Much more commonly, consecutive exotropia develops &#173;after previous surgery for esotropia <span class="italic">(postsurgical exotropia),</span> usually within a few months or years &#173;after the initial surgery. However, in some patients who had surgery for infantile esotropia, consecutive exotropia may not develop &#173;until adulthood. Consecutive exotropia may be intermittent or constant.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Other Forms of Exotropia</p>
			<div id="Chapt9_Top7">
			<p class="h2-h1">Exotropic Duane Retraction Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most widely used classification of Duane retraction syndrome defines 3 types. Patients with type 2 can pres&#173;ent with exotropia, usually accompanied by deficient adduction and a head turn away from the affected side. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span> for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Neuromuscular Abnormalities</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A constant exotropia may result from third nerve palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, or myasthenia gravis. &#173;These conditions are discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span> of this volume and in BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Dissociated Horizontal Deviation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dissociated strabismus complex may include vertical, horizontal, and/or torsional components (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;2 and Chapter&#160;11</span>). It may be associated with infantile esotropia. When a dissociated abduction movement is predominant, the condition is called <span class="italic">dissociated horizontal deviation (DHD).</span> Though not a true exotropia, DHD can be confused with a constant or intermittent exotropia. Dissociated vertical deviation and latent nystagmus often coexist with DHD (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 9-2</span>). In rare cases, patients may manifest both DHD&#160;and intermittent esotropia. DHD must be differentiated from anisohyperopia associated with intermittent exotropia, in which the exotropic deviation is pres&#173;ent during fixation with the normal eye but is masked during fixation with the hyperopic eye &#173;because of accommodative convergence. Treatment of DHD usually consists of unilateral or bilateral lateral rectus recession in addition to any necessary oblique or vertical muscle surgery.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Convergence Paralysis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Convergence paralysis is distinct from convergence insufficiency and usually secondary to an intracranial lesion, most commonly in association with dorsal midbrain syndrome (see BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology</span>). It is characterized by normal adduction and accommodation, with exotropia and diplopia pres&#173;ent at attempted near fixation only. Apparent convergence paralysis due to malingering or lack of effort can be distinguished from true convergence paralysis by the absence of pupillary constriction with attempted near fixation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of convergence paralysis is difficult and often limited to use of base-in prisms at near to alleviate the diplopia. Plus lenses may be required if accommodation is limited. Monocular occlusion is indicated if diplopia cannot be other&#173;wise treated.</p>
