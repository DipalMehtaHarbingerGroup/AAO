			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Definitions</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top1"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">strabismus</span> is derived from the Greek word <span class="italic">strabismos</span>—&#173;“to squint, to look obliquely or askance”—&#173;and means ocular misalignment. This misalignment may be caused by abnormalities in binocular vision or by anomalies of neuromuscular control of ocular motility. Many terms are used in discussions of strabismus. Familiarity with this terminology can aid the reader in understanding &#173;these disorders; misuse of &#173;these terms could cause confusion. Unfortunately, some terms still in use are not correct physiologically.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Orthophoria</span> is the ideal condition of perfect ocular alignment. In practice, orthophoria is seldom encountered, as a small heterophoria can be found in most &#173;people. Some ophthalmologists therefore prefer <span class="italic">orthotropia</span> to mean correct direction or position of the eyes &#173;under binocular conditions. Both terms are commonly used to describe eyes without manifest strabismus. <span class="italic">Heterophoria</span> is an ocular deviation kept latent by the fusional mechanism (latent strabismus). <span class="italic">Heterotropia</span> is a deviation that is pres&#173;ent when both eyes are open and used for viewing (manifest strabismus). It is sometimes helpful to identify the deviating eye, particularly when vertical deviations or restrictive or paretic strabismus is being mea&#173;sured, or when amblyopia is pres&#173;ent in a preverbal child.</p>
			<p class="h2">Prefixes and Suffixes</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A detailed nomenclature has evolved to describe the vari&#173;ous types of ocular deviations. In this vocabulary, the prefix used indicates the relative position of the visual axes of the 2&#160;eyes, or the direction of deviation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Prefixes</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Eso-&#173;</span> The eye is rotated so that it is deviated nasally. &#173;Because the visual axes align at a point closer than the fixation target, this state is also known as <span class="italic">convergent strabismus,</span> one type of horizontal strabismus.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Exo-&#173;</span> The eye is rotated so that it is deviated temporally. &#173;Because the visual axes are diverging from the fixation target, this state is also known as <span class="italic">divergent strabismus,</span> another form of horizontal strabismus.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Hyper-&#173;</span> The eye is rotated so that it is deviated superiorly. This describes one type of <span class="italic">vertical strabismus.</span></p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Hypo-&#173;</span> The eye is rotated so that it is deviated inferiorly. This describes another type of <span class="italic">vertical strabismus.</span></p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Incyclo-&#173;</span> The eye is rotated so that the superior pole of the vertical meridian is rotated nasally. This state is known as <span class="italic">intorsion.</span></p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Excyclo-&#173;</span> The eye is rotated so that the superior pole of the vertical meridian is rotated temporally. This state is known as <span class="italic">extorsion.</span></p>
			<p class="h3">Suffixes</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">-&#173;phoria</span> A latent deviation (eg, esophoria, exophoria, right hyperphoria); the deviation is controlled by the fusional mechanism so that the eyes remain aligned &#173;under binocular conditions.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">-&#173;tropia</span> A manifest deviation (eg, esotropia, exotropia, right hypertropia); the deviation exceeds the control of the fusional mechanism so that the eyes are misaligned &#173;under binocular conditions. Heterotropias can be constant or intermittent.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Strabismus Classification Terms</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top2"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several methods of classifying ocular alignment and motility disorders are used, as no classification is perfect or all-&#173;inclusive. Terms used in &#173;these classifications are presented herein.</p>
			<p class="h3">Age at onset</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Infantile</span> A deviation documented at or before age 6 months, presumably related to a defect pres&#173;ent at birth. The term <span class="italic">congenital</span> is sometimes used, although it may be less accurate &#173;because the deviation is usually not pres&#173;ent at birth.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Acquired</span> A deviation with onset &#173;after 6 months of age, following a period of presumably normal ocular alignment.</p>
			<p class="h3">Fixation</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Alternating</span> Spontaneous alternation of fixation from one eye to the other.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Monocular</span>  Fixation with one eye only.</p>
			<p class="h3">Variation of the deviation size with gaze position or fixating eye</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Comitant (concomitant)</span> The size of the deviation does not vary by more than a few prism diopters in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent positions of gaze or with &#173;either eye used for fixation.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Incomitant (noncomitant)</span> The deviation varies in size in dif&#173;fer&#173;ent positions of gaze or with the eye used for fixation.</p>
			<p class="h3">Miscellaneous terms</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-1"><span class="h4-head">Consecutive</span> A strabismus that is in the direction opposite that of a previous strabismus. For example, consecutive exotropia is an exotropia that follows an esotropia.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Dissociated strabismus complex</span>  Consists of dissociated vertical deviation, dissociated horizontal deviation, and dissociated torsional deviation. The number of components varies, with some patients having all 3 and &#173;others having only 1. Dissociated vertical deviation is the most prevalent of the 3 components. The complex can be bilateral or unilateral; if it is bilateral, the degree of control of the deviation can vary between the eyes.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Overelevation in adduction and overdepression in adduction</span> &#173;These motility anomalies—&#173;frequently also called <span class="italic">inferior oblique overaction</span> and <span class="italic">superior oblique overaction,</span> respectively—&#173;can be caused by overaction of the oblique muscles, as well as by other mechanisms (see Chapter&#160;11).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Underelevation in adduction and underdepression in adduction</span> &#173;These motility anomalies—&#173;frequently also called <span class="italic">inferior oblique underaction</span> and <span class="italic">superior oblique underaction,</span> respectively—&#173;can be caused by underaction of the oblique muscles, as well as by other mechanisms (see Chapter&#160;11).</p>
