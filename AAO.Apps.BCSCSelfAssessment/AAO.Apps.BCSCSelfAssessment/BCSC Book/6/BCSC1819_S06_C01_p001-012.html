			<p class="body-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-3">&#173;Children and their ophthalmic prob&#173;lems differ greatly from the patients and ocular conditions encountered in adult ophthalmology. Each developmental level in &#173;children requires a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent approach for the examination, but with proper preparation and a positive attitude, the ophthalmologist can find the examination of pediatric patients to be both enjoyable and rewarding.</p>
			<p class="h1">Examination of Children in the Outpatient Setting</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top1"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An unworried child &#173;will allow a more pleasant and valuable examination. The atmosphere in the ophthalmology office or clinic, therefore, should be welcoming and positive. Preferably, a small room or section of the waiting area should be designated and designed for &#173;children. Parents and caregivers, as well as any adult patients, &#173;will be grateful for this separation. Also, &#173;because some &#173;children fear the white coat, many pediatric prac&#173;ti&#173;tion&#173;ers choose not to wear one.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A dedicated long pediatric examination lane with dif&#173;fer&#173;ent types of distance fixation targets (including remotely activated videos and mechanical animals 6 meters from the examination chair) is optimal. Having several small toys readily available for near fixation is useful for the <span class="italic">1 toy, 1 look</span> rule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-1</span>). Translucent, plastic fin&#173;ger puppets become &#173;silent accommodative near targets that can also provide a corneal light reflex if placed over a muscle light or penlight.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">History and Examination: General Considerations and Strategies</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top2"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For the pediatric history, it is impor&#173;tant to obtain information about the pregnancy and neonatal period, with attention to maternal health and the patient’s weight and gestational age at birth. The practitioner should ask &#173;whether the child has reached applicable developmental milestones, &#173;whether &#173;there are any neurologic prob&#173;lems, and &#173;whether &#173;there is a &#173;family history of strabismus or other childhood eye disorders.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The examination begins as the practitioner enters the room. An experienced practi&#173;tioner may gather impor&#173;tant information before formal examination begins. Visual be&#173;hav&#173;ior, abnormal head position, dysmorphic features, ability to ambulate, familial disorders (note parents and siblings), and &#173;family social dynamics can be effectively observed. A parent’s smartphone may contain photos and videos that prove useful in establishing a diagnosis and a condition’s progression over time.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The practitioner should sit at the child’s eye level; note that some &#173;children are more contented sitting in a parent’s lap. Introducing oneself to the child and &#173;family and establishing and maintaining eye contact with the child are impor&#173;tant. Being relaxed, open, and playful during the examination helps create a “safe” environment. Gaining the child’s confidence can lead to a faster and better examination, easier follow-up visits, and greater parental support.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is helpful to first address a young child with easy questions. For example, &#173;children enjoy being regarded as “big” and correcting adults when they are wrong. The practitioner can tell a child, “You look so grown up,” before grossly overestimating the patient’s age or grade level and asking, “Is that right?” A &#173;simple joke can relax both child and parent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because cooperation may be fleeting, the examination ele&#173;ments that are most critical for diagnosis and management should be addressed early. If binocular fusion is in doubt, it should be checked first, before being disrupted by other tests, including &#173;those for visual acuity. When pos&#173;si&#173;ble, the most threatening parts of the examination should be performed last.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A dif&#173;fer&#173;ent vocabulary should be developed for working with &#173;children, such as “I want to show you something special” instead of “I need to examine you.” Use “magic sunglasses” for the stereo glasses, “special flashlight” for the retinoscope, “funny hat” for the indirect ophthalmoscope, and “magnifying glass” for the indirect lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text">While checking vision, the practitioner can make the child feel successful by initially presenting objects that can be readily discerned and then saying, “That’s too easy—&#173;let’s try this one.” Confrontation visual field testing can be performed as a counting-&#173;fingers game. &#173;Children might be coaxed into a slit-&#173;lamp examination if told they can “drive the motorcycle” by grabbing the &#173;handles of the slit lamp. Pushing the “magic button” on the child’s nose while a distance fixation target is surreptitiously activated distracts and disarms the patient and allows for a more deliberate examination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For examination of a difficult child, some combination of rest periods, persuasion, per&#173;sis&#173;tence, and rewards is usually successful. If a child is having a bad day, however, it is sometimes best to stop the examination and schedule another appointment. For the follow-up examination of an infant who was fussy during the first visit, ask the parent or other caregiver to bring the infant in hungry and then feed him or her during the examination. In infants and younger &#173;children, brief restraint may prevail. However, the practitioner must consider the physical and emotional consequences of restraining a child. Depending on the nature of the ocular prob&#173;lem, a sedated examination or an examination &#173;under anesthesia may be a better solution.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Examination: Specific Elements</p>
			<div id="Chapt1_Top3"> 
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ele&#173;ments that constitute a complete pediatric ophthalmology examination parallel &#173;those that make up an adult examination but often require dif&#173;fer&#173;ent techniques and devices. The following sections focus on &#173;these differences.</p>
			<p class="h2">Visual Acuity Assessment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Visual acuity assessment requires dif&#173;fer&#173;ent approaches depending on the age, developmental level, and cooperativeness of the child. In &#173;children, detection of amblyopia is of par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar concern (see Chapter&#160;6). Amblyopia is a developmental disorder of the central ner&#173;vous system due to the abnormal pro&#173;cessing of visual images, which leads to reduced visual acuity. Amblyopia is responsible for more cases of childhood-&#173;onset unilateral decreased vision than all other &#173;causes combined but is preventable or reversible with timely detection and intervention. Early detection of reduced vision from amblyopia is pos&#173;si&#173;ble with the techniques described herein.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ideally, accurate mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of monocular distance visual acuity using a linear display of Sloan letters would be pos&#173;si&#173;ble in all pediatric patients. Commonly, however, the child is preverbal, preliterate, or not fully cooperative. In &#173;these cases, clinical options include assessment of fixation be&#173;hav&#173;ior or testing with alternative eye charts designed for preliterate &#173;children.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In infants and toddlers, fixation be&#173;hav&#173;ior is observed to qualitatively assess visual acuity. Preferential looking and visual evoked potential testing may allow quantitative assessment of visual acuity in this young population (see the section “Alternative methods of visual acuity assessment in preverbal &#173;children”). <span class="italic">Fixation and following (tracking)</span> be&#173;hav&#173;ior is observed as the child’s attention is directed to the examiner’s face or to a small toy in the examiner’s hand. <span class="italic">Fixation preference</span> is determined by observing how the patient responds to having one eye covered compared with the other eye covered. &#173;Children typically resist occlusion of the eye with better vision. Determining &#173;whether each eye can maintain fixation through smooth pursuit or a blink provides additional information; strong fixation preference for one eye indicates decreased vision in the nonpreferred eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fixation be&#173;hav&#173;ior may be characterized by the CSM (Central, Steady, and Maintained) method. <span class="italic">Central</span> refers to foveal fixation, tested monocularly. If the fixation target is viewed eccentrically, fixation is termed <span class="italic">uncentral (UC). Steady</span> refers to the absence of nystagmus and other motor disruptions of fixation (see Chapter&#160;13). The <span class="italic">S</span> assessment is also performed monocularly. <span class="italic">Maintained</span> refers to fixation that is held &#173;after the opposite eye is uncovered. An eye that does not maintain fixation may be presumed to have lower visual acuity than the opposite eye. Maintained fixation is easier to identify in a patient with strabismus than in one without this defect. For &#173;children without strabismus or with a small &#173;angle of strabismic deviation, the <span class="italic">induced tropia test</span> may be useful (see Chapter&#160;2 for strabismus terminology). First, the examiner directs the child’s attention to a target. Then a 10–20 prism diopter base-&#173;down prism is placed in front of 1 eye, and the eyes are observed. The prism is then placed in front of the opposite eye. If the eyes move up, the child is fixating with the eye &#173;under the prism. If the child alternates fixation during the test, a strong preference is not pres&#173;ent. If the child consistently fixates with the same eye, the opposite eye likely has decreased vision. The visual acuity of an eye that has eccentric fixation and nystagmoid movements when attempting fixation would be designated <span class="italic">uncentral, unsteady,</span> and <span class="italic">unmaintained (UC, US, UM).</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Monocular recognition testing—&#173;which involves identifying letters, numbers, or symbols (all termed <span class="italic">optotypes</span>) with each eye separately—is the preferred method of assessing visual acuity. Optotypes may be presented on a wall chart, computer monitor, or handheld card. The acuity test should be calibrated for the test distance used. &#173;Because of the potential for variable or inaccurate viewing distances when near vision is tested, mea&#173;sure&#173;ment at distance is preferred.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In eye charts used for testing preliterate &#173;children, the optotypes may be symbols or letters for matching. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;1-1</span> lists the expected recognition visual acuity, as mea&#173;sured by an ophthalmologist, for &#173;children at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent ages; &#173;these visual acuity levels may differ from &#173;those used in primary care vision screening criteria. Copies of appropriate optotypes may be given to the parent before the test for at-&#173;home rehearsal to improve testability, as well as the speed and reliability of responses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vari&#173;ous optotypes are available for recognition visual acuity testing in preliterate &#173;children. LEA symbols (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-2</span>) and the HOTV test (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-3</span>) are reliably calibrated and have high testability rates for preschool-&#173;aged &#173;children. For a shy child, testability may be improved by having the child point to match optotypes on a chart with &#173;those on a handheld card rather than verbally identify them. Several symbol charts, such as Allen figures and the Light&#173;house chart, are not recommended by the World Health Organ&#173;ization and the National Acad&#173;emy of Sciences &#173;because the optotypes are considered confusing, culturally biased, or nonstandardized. The Tumbling E chart is conceptually difficult for many preschool-&#173;aged &#173;children.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because visual acuity may be overestimated when mea&#173;sured with isolated optotypes, particularly in amblyopia (see Chapter&#160;6), a line of optotypes (linear acuity) or single optotypes surrounded by <span class="italic">contour interaction bars</span> (“crowding bars”; see Fig 1-3) should be used whenever pos&#173;si&#173;ble. The optotypes should be spaced such that the distance between each optotype is no greater than the width of the optotypes on any given line. The design of the Bailey-&#173;Lovie and ETDRS (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study) charts incorporates appropriate linear-&#173;optotype spacing, a consistent number of optotypes on each line, and a logarithmic (logMAR) change in letter size from one line to the next (see Fig 1-2). See also BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics,</span> for further discussion of visual acuity charts<span class="italic">.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">By convention, visual acuity is determined first for the right eye and then for the left. A patch or other occluder is used in front of the left eye as the acuity of the right eye is checked and vice versa. An adhesive patch is the most reliable occluder &#173;because it reduces the possibility that the child &#173;will “peek” around the occluder. Computerized visual acuity test systems allow for randomization of optotype pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, preventing patients from memorizing optotypes and thus increasing test accuracy. Patients with nystagmus may show better binocular than monocular visual acuity. To assess monocular distance visual acuity in this situation, the fellow eye, rather than being occluded, should be fogged by using a translucent occluder or a lens <span class="symbol">+</span>5.00 diopters (D) greater than the refractive error in that eye. Patients with poor vision may need to move closer to the chart &#173;until they can see the 20/400 line. In such cases, visual acuity is recorded as the distance in feet (numerator) over the size of the letter (denominator); for example, if the patient is able to read 20/400 optotypes at 5 ft, the acuity is recorded as 5/400. See the visual acuity conversion chart on the inside front cover of this book, which provides conversions of visual acuity mea&#173;sure&#173;ments for the vari&#173;ous methods in use.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The line with the smallest optotypes in which most of the optotypes are identified by the patient is recorded; if the patient misses a few optotypes on a line, a notation is made. For adults and &#173;children, visual acuity test results may vary depending on the chart used. The clinician should document the type of test performed, specifying the optotype and &#173;whether crowding was used, to facilitate comparison of mea&#173;sure&#173;ments obtained at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent times.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Age-&#173;appropriate optotypes are also used to determine uncorrected and corrected near visual acuity. Mea&#173;sur&#173;ing near visual acuity in &#173;children with reduced vision is helpful for determining how they may function at school.</p>
			<p class="h3">Alternative methods of visual acuity assessment in preverbal &#173;children</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Two major methods are used to quantitate visual acuity in preverbal infants and toddlers: <span class="italic">preferential looking (PL)</span> and <span class="italic">visual evoked potential (VEP).</span></p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Preferential looking tests</span> In &#173;these tests, the child’s response to a visual stimulus is observed to assess visual acuity. Teller Acuity Cards II (Stereo Optical, Inc, Chicago, IL), the LEA Grating Acuity Test (Good-&#173;Lite Com&#173;pany, Elgin, IL), and Patti Stripes Square Wave Grating Paddles (Precision Vision, Woodstock, IL) mea&#173;sure grating acuity, a form of resolution acuity, demonstrated by the subject’s ability to detect patterns composed of uniformly spaced black and white stripes on a gray background. Grating acuity can be mea&#173;sured as early as infancy. Movement of the eyes &#173;toward the stripes indicates that the child can see them. Seeing narrower stripes denotes better vision (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 1-4</span>, Video 1-1). The Cardiff Acuity Test, popu&#173;lar in Eu&#173;rope, uses vanishing optotypes for preferential looking.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Visual evoked potential</span> Sweep visual evoked potential (VEP) can also be used to quantitatively assess visual acuity in preverbal patients. In this test, electrodes are placed over the occipital lobe to mea&#173;sure electrical signals produced in response to a visual stimulus. The child views a series of bar or grid patterns. If the stimulus is large enough for the child to discriminate, a visual impulse is recorded. Visual acuity is estimated based on the smallest stimulus width that produces a response.</p>
			<p class="h2">Red Reflex Examination and the Brückner Test</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Br<span class="accent">ü</span>ckner test is performed in a semidark room using a direct ophthalmoscope to assess the red reflex from both eyes si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously at a distance of approximately 1&#160;m. The clinician can quickly determine the clarity and symmetry of the 2 red reflexes and identify potentially amblyogenic conditions such as anisometropia, isoametropia, and ocular misalignment. A strabismic eye tends to give a brighter red reflex than does the fixating eye.</p>
			<p class="h2">Dynamic Retinoscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dynamic retinoscopy is a technique for mea&#173;sur&#173;ing accommodation. For the test, the child is presented a distance fixation target, quickly followed by a near fixation target, while the retinoscopic reflex is observed. In a child with normal accommodation, the reflex &#173;will be neutralized at near focus. A poor accommodative response indicates a pos&#173;si&#173;ble need for bifocal or reading glasses. Hypoaccommodation occurs much more frequently in &#173;children with Down syndrome or ce&#173;re&#173;bral palsy than in the general pediatric population.</p>
			<p class="h2">Visual Field Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Information about the visual fields can be obtained in very young patients, once visual fixation has developed (usually by 4 months of age). A peripheral target is presented while the child is fixating on an in&#173;ter&#173;est&#173;ing central target. Movement of the eyes &#173;toward the peripheral target (an evoked saccade) confirms the field. Confrontation visual fields can be approximated in &#173;children old enough to identify fin&#173;gers placed in each peripheral quadrant. School-&#173;aged &#173;children can often be evaluated with manual or automated perimetry.</p>
			<p class="h2">Pupil Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The pupillary light reflex is not reliably pres&#173;ent &#173;until approximately 30 weeks’ gestational age. Pupils are usually miotic in newborns and gradually increase in size &#173;until preadolescence. Accurate pupil testing in young &#173;children is complicated by the smaller pupil and difficulty controlling accommodation. Careful observation, remote or foot control of the room lights to allow continued observation during changes in room illumination, and use of appropriate distance fixation targets greatly facilitate pupil evaluation. Digital photography can also be useful for observing and documenting pupil size and symmetry.</p>
			<p class="h2">Anterior Segment Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A successful anterior segment examination is usually pos&#173;si&#173;ble in &#173;children but may require per&#173;sis&#173;tence and varied techniques. &#173;Children old enough to sit by themselves can usually be enticed to hold the “motorcycle &#173;handles” of the slit lamp long enough for a brief examination. A younger child may be positioned at the slit lamp while in a parent’s lap. &#173;Children unable or unwilling to cooperate for standard slit-&#173;lamp examination may be examined with a portable slit lamp, surgical loupes, or a 20 D or 28 D handheld lens used with an indirect ophthalmoscope.</p>
			<p class="h2">Intraocular Pressure Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">It is not always easy or pos&#173;si&#173;ble to perform formal tonometry in &#173;children. Tonometry requires a relaxed patient. With a nonthreatening approach and experience, the practitioner may find that accurate testing is pos&#173;si&#173;ble in &#173;children by using handheld devices such as the Icare tonometer (Icare Finland Oy, Helsinki, Finland) or Tono-&#173;Pen (Reichert Technologies, Depew, NY). The Tono-&#173;Pen or the Perkins Tonometer (Haag-&#173;Streit USA, Mason, OH) may be used to test infants when they are sleeping or feeding in the supine position.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Digital palpation, though not quantitative, can provide a gross assessment of intraocular pressure. Interpretation of the findings requires practice and involves correlation with formal tonometry results obtained in the same patient.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cycloplegic Refraction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because of the relationship between accommodation and ocular convergence, refraction with cycloplegic agents is a particularly impor&#173;tant test in the evaluation of any patient who has issues relating to binocular vision and ocular motility.</p>
			<p class="h3">Refraction technique</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Refraction is generally performed &#173;after cycloplegia. The ophthalmologist’s working distance and the child’s visual axis are impor&#173;tant considerations. To be accurate, retinoscopy must be performed on axis. The 2 main methods for refraction are loose lenses for infants and younger &#173;children and the phoropter for &#173;those old enough to sit in an examination chair.</p>
			<p class="h3">Cycloplegic agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Cyclopentolate hydrochloride</span> (1%) is the preferred cycloplegic drug for routine use in &#173;children. Use of a weaker concentration of cyclopentolate (0.2% to 0.5%) is suggested in infants. <span class="italic">Tropicamide</span> (0.5% or 1%) is usually not potent enough for effective cycloplegia in &#173;children. Many ophthalmologists use a combination of cyclopentolate, tropicamide, and/or phenylephrine to achieve maximum pupil dilatation. <span class="italic">Atropine</span> (1%) drops or ointment is used by some ophthalmologists, particularly in young &#173;children with esotropia or dark irides, but this drug &#173;causes prolonged blurring and is more often associated with adverse effects (see the section “Adverse effects of cycloplegic agents”). Some ophthalmologists choose atropine to ensure complete cycloplegia in select cases of accommodative esotropia.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-table">Table&#160;1-2</span> gives the administration schedule and onset of action for commonly used cycloplegics. The duration of action varies greatly, and the pupillary effect occurs earlier and lasts longer than the cycloplegic effect; thus, a dilated pupil does not necessarily indicate complete cycloplegia. For patients with accommodative esodeviations, repeated cycloplegic examinations are essential when control of strabismus is precarious.</p>
			<p class="h3">Eyedrops in &#173;children</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most young &#173;children are apprehensive about eyedrops. Fortunately, &#173;there are many approaches to administering eyedrops. If pos&#173;si&#173;ble, to improve the child’s cooperation for the remainder of the examination, someone other than the physician should instill the drops, which can be described to the child as being “like a splash of swimming pool &#173;water” that &#173;will “feel funny.” Some prac&#173;ti&#173;tion&#173;ers administer a topical anesthetic drop first, while &#173;others use the cycloplegic drops alone; some use a compounded cycloplegic spray from an atomizer.</p>
			<p class="h3">Adverse effects of cycloplegic agents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Adverse reactions to cycloplegic agents include allergic (or hypersensitivity) reaction with conjunctivitis, edematous eyelids, and dermatitis. &#173;These reactions are more common with atropine than with the other agents. Cycloplegic agents may also cause systemic symptoms, including fever, dry mouth, flushing, tachycardia, constipation, urinary retention, nausea, dizziness, and delirium. Treatment is discontinuation of the drug, with supportive mea&#173;sures as necessary. If the reaction is severe, physostigmine may be given. One drop of atropine, 1%, contains 0.5&#160;mg of atropine. See also BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology,</span> Part V: Ocular Pharmacology.</p>
			<p class="h2">Fundus Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The fundus examination is typically the final component of a complete pediatric ophthalmology examination. Though often challenging to obtain in young &#173;children, an adequate view of the fundus is impor&#173;tant for identifying pathology. &#173;After mydriasis is achieved, infants and small &#173;children can be examined with the indirect ophthalmoscope, often more easily by using decreased illumination. Examination may require restraint of some infants, particularly &#173;those being screened for retinopathy of prematurity (in &#173;these cases, a topical anesthetic, eyelid speculum, and scleral depression are necessary for a complete ret&#173;i&#173;nal evaluation). For many young &#173;children, the practitioner can obtain sufficient views by using diversionary targets such as illuminated toys and cartoons.</p>
