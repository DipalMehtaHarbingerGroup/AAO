			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Disorders of the pediatric lens include cataract and abnormalities in lens shape, size, and location. Such abnormalities constitute a significant source of visual impairment in &#173;children. The incidence of lens abnormalities ranges from 1:4000 to 1:10,000 live births per year worldwide.</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="h2">General Features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataracts in &#173;children can be isolated, or they can be associated with a number of conditions, including chromosomal abnormalities, systemic syndromes and diseases, infection, trauma, and radiation exposure. In almost all cases of cataract associated with systemic disease, the cataracts are bilateral (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;23-1</span>); many bilateral cataracts, however, are not associated with systemic disease. Significant asymmetry can be pres&#173;ent in bilateral cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cataracts can also be associated with other ocular anomalies, including per&#173;sis&#173;tent fetal vasculature, anterior segment dysgenesis, aniridia, and ret&#173;i&#173;nal disorders (eg, coloboma, detachment).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pediatric cataracts can be congenital or acquired. Congenital cataracts are pres&#173;ent at birth, although they may not be identified &#173;until &#173;later. Infantile cataracts are pres&#173;ent &#173;during the first year of life. The terms <span class="italic">congenital</span> and <span class="italic">infantile cataract</span> are typically used synonymously. In general, the earlier the onset, the more amblyogenic the cataract will be, particularly in unilateral cases. Lens opacities that are visually significant before 2–3 months of age are the most likely to be detrimental to vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most hereditary cataracts show an autosomal dominant mode of transmission, and they are almost always bilateral. X-&#173;linked and autosomal recessive inheritance may occur; the latter is more common in consanguineous populations. <span class="italic">OMIM</span> (<span class="italic">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man;</span> omim.&#173;org) includes the most up-&#173;to-&#173;date information on ge&#173;ne&#173;tic disorders with lens involvement.</p>
			<p class="h2">Morphology</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cataracts can involve the entire lens <span class="italic">(total,</span> or <span class="italic">complete,</span> cataract) or only part of the lens structure. The location in the lens and morphology of the cataract provide information about etiology (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;23-2</span>), onset, and prognosis. Impor&#173;tant types and &#173;causes of cataract in &#173;children are discussed in the following sections.</p>
			<p class="h3">Anterior polar cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Anterior polar cataracts (APCs) are common and usually less than 3&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter, appearing as small white dots in the center of the anterior lens capsule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-1</span>). They are congenital, usually sporadic opacities. APCs can be unilateral or bilateral. They are usually nonprogressive and visually insignificant, perhaps more appropriately termed <span class="italic">an</span><span class="italic">terior lens opacities.</span> However, unilateral APCs are associated with anisometropia, which may cause amblyopia; thus, careful refraction and follow-up are indicated. <span class="italic">Anterior pyra</span><span class="italic">midal cataracts,</span> as the name suggests, have a pyramidal shape and proj&#173;ect into the anterior chamber. This cataract is a larger, more severe form of APC. It is often associated with cortical changes that can be progressive and amblyogenic, depending on the size of the opacity.</p>
			<p class="h3">Infantile nuclear cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nuclear cataracts are opacities that involve the center, or nucleus, of the lens. They are usually approximately 3&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter, but the irregularity of the lens fibers can extend more peripherally. Density and size can vary. Infantile nuclear cataracts may not be significantly dense at birth (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-2</span>). They can be inherited or sporadic and are more commonly bilateral. &#173;These opacities are usually stable, but they can pro&#173;gress. Eyes with nuclear cataracts may be smaller than normal.</p>
			<p class="h3">Lamellar cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lamellar <span class="italic">(zonular)</span> cataracts affect one or more of the layers of the developing lens cortex surrounding the nucleus. Affected lenses have a clear center, a discrete lamellar opacity, and a clear peripheral cortex. Larger than nuclear cataracts, &#173;these opacities are typically 5&#160;mm or more in dia&#173;meter (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-3</span>). They can be unilateral but are more often bilateral. The size and corneal dia&#173;meter of affected eyes are normal. Lamellar cataracts are often less dense than other forms of infantile cataracts, and therefore the visual prognosis is usually better.</p>
			<p class="h3">Posterior lenticonus</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Posterior lenticonus is a cone-&#173;shaped deformation of the posterior lens surface caused by progressive thinning of the central capsule (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-4A</span>); when the deformation is spherical, it is referred to as <span class="italic">lentiglobus</span>. This thinning initially &#173;causes the lens to have an “oil droplet” appearance on red reflex examination. As the outpouching of the lens progresses, the surrounding cortical fibers gradually opacify (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-4B</span>). This pro&#173;cess can take many years, but if the capsule develops a small tear, rapid, total opacification of the lens can occur (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-4C</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The opacities are almost always unilateral, and the affected eye is normal in size. Although the weakness in the posterior capsule may be congenital, the cataract does not usually form &#173;until &#173;later and thus behaves like an acquired cataract. The visual prognosis &#173;after cataract surgery is usually favorable.</p>
			<p class="h3">Posterior subcapsular cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSCs) are less common in &#173;children than in adults. They are usually acquired and are often bilateral. PSCs tend to pro&#173;gress. &#173;Causes of PSC include corticosteroid use, uveitis, ret&#173;i&#173;nal abnormalities, radiation exposure, and trauma. PSCs can be seen in association with neurofibromatosis type 2 and may be the first observed manifestation of this disorder.</p>
			<p class="h3">Sectoral cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Wedge-&#173;shaped cortical cataracts are occasionally seen in &#173;children. &#173;These opacities may be idiopathic, or they may be associated with occult posterior segment tumor, previous blunt trauma, vitreoretinopathies, or ret&#173;i&#173;nal coloboma with fibrous bands attached to the posterior lens capsule. Careful posterior segment examination is indicated to rule out &#173;these associated pathologies.</p>
			<p class="h3">Peripheral vacuolar cataract</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;These asymptomatic peripheral lens vacuoles are sometimes seen in premature infants. The cataracts are most often encountered during examination for retinopathy of prematurity. They are rarely visually significant and usually resolve spontaneously.</p>
			<p class="h3">Per&#173;sis&#173;tent fetal vasculature</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Per&#173;sis&#173;tent fetal vasculature (PFV; previously called <span class="italic">per&#173;sis&#173;tent hyperplastic primary vitreous</span>) is the most common cause of a unilateral cataract. PFV is typically an isolated, sporadic ocular malformation, but bilateral cases may be associated with systemic or neurologic abnormalities. Usually, affected eyes are smaller than normal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">PFV ranges in severity from mild to severe (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-5</span>). Features of mild PFV are prominent hyaloid vessel remnants, a large Mittendorf dot, and Bergmeister papilla. At the other end of the spectrum are microphthalmic eyes with dense retrolental plaques; a thick, fibrous per&#173;sis&#173;tent hyaloid artery; elongated ciliary pro&#173;cesses (classic for PFV), which may be vis&#173;i&#173;ble through the dilated pupil; and prominent radial iris vessels. Traction on the optic disc may cause distortion of the posterior ret&#173;ina. Varying degrees of lens opacification occur. The opacity usually consists of a retrolental plaque that is densest centrally and may contain cartilage and fibrovascular tissue.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The natu&#173;ral history of more severely affected eyes is usually one of progressive cataract formation and anterior chamber shallowing, causing secondary glaucoma. The glaucoma can occur acutely &#173;because of rapid, total lens opacification and swelling, or it may develop gradually, over years. Congenital ret&#173;i&#173;nal nonattachment, ciliary body detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and optic nerve dysmorphism are other features of severe PFV.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Retinoblastoma may be part of the initial differential diagnosis of PFV &#173;because of leukocoria. The presence of microphthalmia and cataract are impor&#173;tant &#173;factors in the differentiation of &#173;these disorders, as retinoblastoma is rarely found in microphthalmic eyes, and cataracts are very unusual in retinoblastoma.</p>
			<p class="h2">Evaluation of Pediatric Cataracts</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All newborns should have a screening eye examination performed by their primary care provider, including an evaluation of the red reflex. Retinoscopy through an undilated pupil is helpful for assessing the potential visual significance of an axial lens opacity in a preverbal child. <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;23-3</span> summarizes the evaluation of pediatric cataracts.</p>
			<p class="h3">History</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinician should obtain a history of the child’s growth, development, and systemic disorders, in addition to a &#173;family history, as this information can help guide the evaluation. For example, a patient with acquired cataract and intractable diarrhea should be evaluated for the treatable metabolic disorder cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. A slit-&#173;lamp examination of immediate &#173;family members can reveal previously undiagnosed lens opacities that are visually insignificant but that may indicate an inherited cause for the child’s cataracts. Congenital posterior sutural cataracts, for example, develop in female carriers of X-&#173;linked Nance-&#173;Horan syndrome, and mild lenticular opacities develop in female carriers of Lowe (oculocerebrorenal) syndrome by puberty.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Examination</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Visual function</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The mere presence of a cataract does not suggest that surgical removal is necessary. That determination requires assessment of the visual significance of the lens opacity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In healthy infants aged 2 months or younger, the fixation reflex may not be fully developed; thus, its absence in this group of patients is not necessarily abnormal. In general, anterior capsule opacities are not visually significant &#173;unless they occlude the entire pupil. Central or posterior lens opacities of sufficient density that are greater than 3&#160;mm in dia&#173;meter are usually visually significant. Opacities that have a large area of surrounding normal red reflex or that have clear areas within them may allow good visual development. Strabismus associated with a unilateral cataract and nystagmus associated with bilateral cataracts indicate that the opacities are visually significant. Although &#173;these signs may also indicate that the optimal time for treatment has passed, cataract surgery may still improve visual function.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In preverbal &#173;children older than 2 months, standard clinical assessment of fixation be&#173;hav&#173;ior, fixation preference, and objection to occlusion provide additional evidence of the visual significance of the cataract(s). For bilateral cataracts, assessment of the child’s visual be&#173;hav&#173;ior and the &#173;family’s observations of the child at home help determine the level of visual function. Preferential looking tests and visual evoked potentials can provide quantitative information (see <span class="xref-table-local">Chapter&#160;1</span>). In older &#173;children, particularly &#173;those with lamellar or posterior subcapsular cataracts, glare testing may be useful for assessing decreased vision.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-3">Ocular examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Slit-&#173;lamp examination can help classify the morphology of the cataract and reveal associated abnormalities of the anterior segment. If the cataract allows some view of the posterior segment, the optic nerve and fovea should be examined. If no such view is pos&#173;si&#173;ble, B-&#173;scan ultrasonography should be performed to assess for anatomical abnormalities of the posterior segment. The presence of ret&#173;i&#173;nal or optic nerve abnormalities cannot be definitively ruled out, however, &#173;until the posterior pole can be visualized directly. See <span class="xref-table-local">&#173;Table&#160;23-3</span> for additional information.</p>
			<p class="h3">Workup</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Unilateral cataracts are not usually associated with systemic disease; laboratory tests are therefore not warranted in &#173;these cases. In contrast, bilateral cataracts are associated with many metabolic or other systemic diseases. If the child has a positive &#173;family history of isolated congenital or childhood cataract or if examination of the parents shows lens opacities (and &#173;there are no associated systemic diseases to explain their cataracts), systemic evaluation and laboratory tests are not necessary. A basic laboratory evaluation for bilateral cataracts of unknown etiology is outlined in <span class="xref-table-local">&#173;Table&#160;23-3</span>.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Further workup should be directed by the presence of other systemic abnormalities. Evaluation by a ge&#173;ne&#173;ticist may be helpful for determining &#173;whether &#173;there are associated disorders and for counseling the patient’s &#173;family regarding recurrence risks. Next-&#173;generation gene sequencing, which analyzes large portions of the genome, is of increasing utility, even in cases without evidence of systemic disease.</p>

			<p class="h1">Cataract Surgery in Pediatric Patients</p>
			<div id="Chapt23_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Timing of the Procedure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In general, the younger the child, the greater the urgency to remove the cataract, &#173;because of the risk of deprivation amblyopia. For optimal visual development, a visually significant unilateral cataract should be removed before age 6 weeks; visually significant bilateral cataracts, before age 10 weeks.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For older &#173;children with bilateral cataracts, surgery is indicated when the level of visual function interferes with the child’s visual needs. Although &#173;children with best-&#173;corrected visual acuity of roughly 20/70 may function relatively well in early grade school, their participation in activities such as unrestricted driving may be restricted. Surgery should be considered when visual acuity decreases to 20/40 or worse.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For older &#173;children with unilateral cataract, cataract surgery is indicated when visual acuity cannot be improved beyond 20/40.</p>
			<p class="h2">Intraocular Lens Use in &#173;Children</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The choice of optical device for correction of aphakia depends primarily on the age of the patient and the laterality of the cataract. Intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in &#173;children aged 1–2&#160;years and older is widely accepted. The use of IOLs in younger infants, however, is associated with a higher rate of complications and larger shifts in refractive error with age. Early surgical intervention followed by consistent contact lens wear and patching of the uninvolved eye usually allows development of some useful vision. In most infants who are left aphakic, secondary IOL implantation can be performed &#173;after 1–2&#160;years of age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Infants with mild PFV have a higher incidence of adverse events &#173;after lensectomy compared with &#173;children with other forms of unilateral cataract, but visual outcomes are similar in both groups.</p>
			<p class="h2">Management of the Anterior Capsule</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">To enable access to the lens nucleus and cortex during cataract surgery, a <span class="italic">capsulorrhexis</span> is performed. &#173;Because the tearing characteristics of the pediatric capsule are quite dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from &#173;those of the adult capsule, lens removal techniques are modified for pediatric patients so that the risk of inadvertent extension of the tear is minimized. The elasticity of the capsule is greatest in younger patients, especially infants, making continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis more difficult. The pulling force should be directed nearly perpendicular to the direction of intended tear, and the capsule should be regrasped frequently to maintain optimal control over the direction of tear. An alternative to capsulorrhexis in infants is <span class="italic">vitrectorhexis,</span> the creation of an anterior capsule opening using a vitrectomy instrument. In &#173;children with dense cataracts that obscure the red reflex, visibility of the anterior capsule can be enhanced with application of trypan blue ophthalmic solution 0.06% to the capsule.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Lensectomy Without Intraocular Lens Implantation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In &#173;children who &#173;will be left aphakic, lensectomy is done through a small peripheral corneal, limbal, or pars plana incision with a vitreous-&#173;cutting instrument (vitrector). Irrigation can be provided by an integrated infusion sleeve or by a separate anterior chamber cannula. Ultrasonic phacoemulsification is not required, as the lens cortex and nucleus are generally soft in &#173;children of all ages. Removing all cortical material is important &#173;because of the propensity for reproliferation of pediatric lens epithelial cells. Tough, fibrotic plaques (eg, in severe PFV) may require manual excision with intraocular scissors and forceps.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;Because posterior capsule opacification occurs rapidly in young &#173;children, a controlled posterior capsulectomy and anterior vitrectomy should be performed at the time of cataract surgery. This technique allows rapid, permanent establishment of a clear visual axis for retinoscopy and prompt fitting and monitoring of the aphakic optical correction. If pos&#173;si&#173;ble, sufficient peripheral lens capsule should be left to facilitate secondary posterior chamber IOL implantation &#173;later.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Lensectomy With Intraocular Lens Implantation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Single-&#173;piece foldable acrylic IOLs, which can be placed through a 3-mm clear corneal or scleral tunnel incision, have become popu&#173;lar in pediatric cataract surgery, although larger single-&#173;piece polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) lenses are also still used. Silicone lenses have not been well studied in &#173;children.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If an IOL is to be placed at the time of cataract extraction, 2 basic techniques can be used for the lensectomy, depending on &#173;whether the posterior capsule &#173;will be left intact. Many pediatric cataract surgeons leave the posterior capsule intact if the child is approaching the age when an Nd:YAG &#173;laser capsulotomy in an awake patient could be performed (usually 5&#160;years of age). Primary capsulectomy is usually preferred for younger &#173;children. Studies have shown that in early childhood, the lens capsule opacifies, on average, within 18–24 months of surgery, but this can vary considerably.</p>
			<p class="h3">Technique with posterior capsule intact</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;After the cortex is aspirated, the clear corneal or scleral tunnel incision is enlarged to allow placement of the IOL. Placement in the capsular bag is desirable, but ciliary sulcus fixation is acceptable. Viscoelastic material should be removed to prevent a postoperative spike in intraocular pressure. Closure of 3-mm clear corneal incisions with absorbable suture is safe and does not induce astigmatism in &#173;children.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Techniques for primary posterior capsulectomy</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-5"><span class="h4-head">Posterior capsulectomy/vitrectomy before IOL placement</span> &#173;After lensectomy, the vitrector settings should be set to the low-&#173;suction, high-&#173;cutting rate appropriate for vitreous surgery. A posterior capsulectomy with anterior vitrectomy is then performed. The anterior capsule is enlarged, if necessary, to an appropriate size for the IOL, and the lens is implanted in the capsular bag or the ciliary sulcus. The surgeon must take care to ensure that the capsulotomy does not extend, the IOL haptics do not go through the posterior opening, and vitreous does not become entangled with the IOL or enter the anterior chamber.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Posterior capsulectomy/vitrectomy &#173;after IOL placement</span> Some surgeons prefer to place the IOL in the capsular bag, close the anterior incision, and approach the posterior capsule through the pars plana. Irrigation can be maintained through the same anterior chamber infusion cannula used during lensectomy. A small conjunctival opening is made over the pars plana, and a sclerotomy is made with a microvitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal blade 2.5–3.0&#160;mm posterior to the limbus. This provides good access to the posterior capsule, and a wide anterior vitrectomy can be performed.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Intraocular lens implantation issues</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Because the eye continues to elongate throughout the first de&#173;cade of life and beyond, &#173;selecting an appropriate IOL power is complicated. Power calculations in infants and young &#173;children may be unpredictable for several reasons, including widely variable growth of the eye, difficulty obtaining accurate keratometry and axial length mea&#173;sure&#173;ments, and use of power formulas that &#173;were developed for adults rather than &#173;children. Studies have shown that in aphakic pediatric eyes, a variable myopic shift in refractive error of approximately 7.00–8.00 D occurs from 1 year to 10&#160;years of age, with a wide standard deviation. This suggests that if a child is made emmetropic with an IOL at 1 year of age, refractive error at 10&#160;years of age can be –8.00 D or greater. Refractive change in &#173;children younger than 1 year is even more unpredictable. This assumes that the presence of an IOL does not alter the normal growth curve of the aphakic eye, an assumption that may not be valid based on results of both animal and early &#173;human studies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lens implantation in &#173;children requires consideration of the age of the child, the target refractive error at the time of surgery, and the refractive error of the contralateral eye. Some surgeons implant IOLs with powers that are expected to be required in adulthood, allowing the child to grow into the selected lens power. Thus, the child initially requires hyperopic correction. Other surgeons aim for emmetropia at the time of lens implantation, especially in unilateral cases, believing that this approach improves the treatment of amblyopia and facilitates development of binocular function by decreasing anisometropia in the early childhood years. &#173;These &#173;children usually become progressively more myopic and may eventually require a second procedure to address the increasing anisometropia.</p>
			<p class="h2">Postoperative Care</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Medical therapy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If all cortical material is adequately removed, postoperative inflammation is usually mild in a child without a lens implant. Topical antibiotics, corticosteroids, and cycloplegics are commonly applied for a few weeks &#173;after surgery. Topical corticosteroids should be used more aggressively in &#173;children who have under&#173;gone IOL implantation. Some surgeons administer intracameral corticosteroids at the time of surgery, and &#173;others use oral corticosteroids postoperatively, especially in very young &#173;children and in &#173;children with heavi&#173;ly pigmented irides. Some surgeons administer intracameral antibiotics in addition to topical antibiotics.</p>
			<p class="h3">Amblyopia management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Amblyopia therapy should begin as soon as pos&#173;si&#173;ble &#173;after surgery. For aphakic patients, contact lenses or glasses should be dispensed within a few weeks of surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For infants with bilateral aphakia, glasses are the safest and simplest method of correction. They can be easily changed according to the refractive shifts that occur with growth of the eye. &#173;Until the child can use a bifocal lens properly, the power selected should make the eye myopic, &#173;because most of an infant’s visual activity occurs at near. Contact lenses may also be used in bilaterally aphakic patients, but they require more effort on the part of both the caregiver and the physician than do glasses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For infants with unilateral aphakia, contact lenses are the most common method of correction. Advantages of contact lenses include relatively easy power changes and the potential for extended wear with certain lenses. Disadvantages include easy displacement by eye rubbing, the expense of replacement, and the risk of microbial keratitis. Aphakic glasses are occasionally used in infants with unilateral aphakia who are unable to tolerate contact lenses, but &#173;these glasses are suboptimal owing to the amblyogenic effect of aniseikonia and the difficulty of wearing glasses that are much heavier on one side.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;After optical correction of aphakia, patching of the better eye is necessary in patients with unilateral cataract and in some patients with bilateral cataracts if the visual acuity is asymmetric. The amount of patching is based on the degree of amblyopia and the age of the child. Avoidance of full-&#173;time occlusion in the neonatal period may allow stimulation of binocular vision and may help prevent strabismus.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Complications Following Pediatric Cataract Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Strabismus is very common in &#173;children following surgery for &#173;either unilateral or bilateral cataracts. The risk of glaucoma is increased in &#173;children who have cataract surgery in infancy and in &#173;those with small eyes (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;22</span>), but glaucoma often does not develop &#173;until several years &#173;after surgery. Corneal decompensation is very rare in &#173;children. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments are also rare and are most likely to occur when other ocular abnormalities are pres&#173;ent. The incidence of macular edema is unknown, as it is difficult to detect ophthalmoscopically in young &#173;children and optical coherence tomography is usually not pos&#173;si&#173;ble. Postoperative endophthalmitis rarely occurs in &#173;children &#173;after cataract surgery.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Visual Outcome &#173;After Cataract Extraction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Visual outcome &#173;after cataract surgery depends on many &#173;factors, including age at onset and type of cataract, timing of surgery, choice of optical correction, and treatment of amblyopia. Early surgery by itself does not ensure a good outcome. Optimal vision requires careful, long-&#173;term postoperative management, particularly regarding amblyopia. Even when congenital cataracts are detected late (&#173;after age 4 months), cataract removal combined with a strong postoperative vision rehabilitation program can achieve good vision in some eyes.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital aphakia, the absence of the lens at birth, is rare. This condition is usually &#173;associated with a markedly abnormal eye.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Spherophakia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A lens that is spherical and smaller than normal is termed <span class="italic">spherophakic.</span> This condition is usually bilateral. The lens may dislocate and prolapse into the anterior chamber, causing secondary glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Coloboma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A lens coloboma involves flattening or notching of the lens periphery (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-6</span>). It may be associated with a coloboma of the iris, optic nerve, or ret&#173;ina, all of which are caused by abnormal closure of the embryonic fissure. The term <span class="italic">lens coloboma</span> is a misnomer &#173;because the lens defect is caused by absence or stretching of the zonular fibers in the affected area (usually inferonasally) and is not directly due to abnormal embryonic fissure closure. In more significant colobomatous defects, lens dislocations may occur superiorly and temporally. Most colobomatous lenses do not progressively worsen.</p>

			<p class="h1">Dislocated Lenses in Children</p>
			<div id="Chapt23_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When the lens is not in its normal position, it is said to be <span class="italic">dislocated</span>. <span class="italic">Subluxated</span> (or <span class="italic">subluxe</span><span class="italic">d</span>) lenses are partly dislocated. <span class="italic">Luxated</span> (or <span class="italic">luxed</span>), or <span class="italic">ec&#173;topic,</span> lenses are completely detached from the ciliary body; they are &#173;free in the posterior chamber (<span class="xref-table">Fig 23-7</span>), or they have prolapsed into the anterior chamber. The amount of dislocation can vary, from slight displacement with minimal <span class="italic">iridodonesis</span> (tremulousness of the iris) to severe displacement in which the lens periphery is not vis&#173;i&#173;ble through the pupillary opening. Lens dislocation can be familial or sporadic. It can be associated with gene mutations that specifically affect the eye, with multisystem disease, and with inborn errors of metabolism (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;23-4</span>). Lens dislocation can occur with trauma, usually involving significant injury to the eye, but this is not common. Spontaneous lens dislocation has been reported in aniridia, buphthalmos associated with congenital glaucoma, and congenital megalocornea with zonular weakness (due to mutations in latent transforming growth &#173;factor beta-&#173;binding protein 2 <span class="italic">[LTBP2]</span>).</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single">Khan AO, Aldahmesh MA, Alkuraya FS. Congenital megalocornea with zonular weakness and childhood lens-&#173;related secondary glaucoma—&#173;a distinct phenotype caused by recessive <span class="italic">LTBP2</span> mutations. <span class="italic">Mol Vis.</span> 2011;17:2570–2579.</p>
			<p class="h2">Isolated Ectopia Lentis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In &#173;simple ectopia lentis, the lens is displaced superiorly and temporally. The condition is usually bilateral and symmetric. Most commonly, it is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Onset can be at birth or &#173;later in life. Glaucoma is common in the late-&#173;onset type.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some patients with heterozygous mutations in <span class="italic">FBN1,</span> which cause Marfan syndrome (discussed &#173;later), do not have the systemic findings associated with this syndrome and have only ectopia lentis.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ectopia Lentis et Pupillae</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ectopia lentis et pupillae is a rare autosomal recessive condition in which &#173;there is bilateral displacement of the pupil, usually inferotemporally, and dislocation of the lens in the opposite direction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-8A</span>) (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;21</span>). The condition is characterized by small, round lenses (microspherophakia); miosis; and poor pupillary dilation with mydriatics. Ectopia lentis et pupillae may be the result of a membrane extending from a posterior origin to attach to the proximal pupil margin (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-8B</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Marfan Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Marfan syndrome is the systemic disease most commonly associated with subluxated lenses. The syndrome consists of abnormalities of the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and ocular systems. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, but &#173;family history is negative in 15% of cases. Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in <span class="italic">FBN1,</span> which provides instructions for making the protein fibrillin-1, the major constituent of extracellular microfibrils. Affected patients are characteristically tall, with long limbs and fin&#173;gers <span class="italic">(arachnodactyly)</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-9</span>); loose, flexible joints; scoliosis; and chest deformities. Cardiovascular abnormalities are a source of significant mortality and manifest as enlargement of the aortic root, dilation of the descending aorta, dissecting aneurysm, and floppy mitral valve. The life expectancy of patients with Marfan syndrome is about half that of the normal population.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular abnormalities occur in more than 80% of affected patients, with lens subluxation being the most common (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-10</span>). In approximately 75% of cases, the lens is subluxated superiorly. Typically, the zonules that are vis&#173;i&#173;ble are intact and unbroken. Examination of the iris usually shows iridodonesis and may reveal transillumination defects near the iris base. The pupil is small and dilates poorly. The corneal curvature is often decreased. The axial length is increased, and affected patients are frequently myopic. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment can occur spontaneously, usually in the second and third de&#173;cades of life.</p>
			<p class="h2">Homocystinuria</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Homocystinuria is a rare autosomal recessive condition, occurring in approximately 1&#160;in 100,000 births. The classic form is usually caused by mutations in the gene encoding cystathionine <span class="greek-tx">β</span>-&#173;synthase, which &#173;causes homocysteine to accumulate in the plasma and to be excreted in the urine.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical manifestations of homocystinuria vary; the eye, skeletal system, central ner&#173;vous system, and vascular system can be affected. Most of the abnormalities develop &#173;after birth and become progressively worse with age. The ophthalmologist may see patients with this disorder before the systemic diagnosis is made. The skeletal features are similar to &#173;those of Marfan syndrome. Affected patients are usually tall and have osteoporosis, scoliosis, and chest deformities. Central ner&#173;vous system abnormalities occur in approximately 50% of patients; intellectual disability and seizures are the most common.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vascular complications are common and secondary to thrombotic disease, which affects large or medium-&#173;sized arteries and veins anywhere in the body. Hypertension and cardiomegaly are also common. Anesthesia carries a higher risk for patients with homocystinuria &#173;because of thromboembolic phenomena; thus, this disorder should be identified before patients undergo general anesthesia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The main ocular finding is lens subluxation, most frequently inferiorly, but the direction of subluxation is not diagnostic. Subluxation typically begins between the ages of 3 and 10&#160;years. The lenses may dislocate into the anterior chamber, a finding suggestive of homocystinuria (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 23-11</span>). The zonular fibers are frequently broken, in contrast with &#173;those in Marfan syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of disulfides, including homocystine, in the urine. Medical management of homocystinuria is directed &#173;toward normalizing the biochemical abnormality. Dietary management (low-&#173;methionine diet and supplemental cysteine) may be attempted. Supplementation with the coenzyme pyridoxine (vitamin B<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">6</span>) diminishes systemic prob&#173;lems in approximately 50% of cases.</p>
			<p class="h2">Weill-&#173;Marchesani Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Patients with Weill-&#173;Marchesani syndrome can be thought of as clinical opposites of &#173;patients with Marfan syndrome in that the former are characteristically short, with brachydactyly and short limbs. Inheritance can be autosomal dominant or recessive. Mutations in the <span class="italic">ADAMTS10</span> gene have been identified in patients with this disorder. The lenses are microspherophakic. With time, the lenses may dislocate into the anterior chamber and cause pupillary block glaucoma. For this reason, prophylactic &#173;laser peripheral iridectomy or lensectomy may be indicated.</p>
			<p class="h2">Sulfite Oxidase Deficiency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sulfite oxidase deficiency (molybdenum cofactor deficiency) is a very rare hereditary disorder of sulfur metabolism manifested by severe neurologic disorders and ectopia lentis. The enzyme deficiency interferes with conversion of sulfite to sulfate, resulting in increased excretion of sulfite in the urine. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the absence of sulfite oxidase activity in skin fibroblasts. Neurologic abnormalities include infantile hemiplegia, choreoathetosis, and seizures. Irreversible brain damage and death usually occur by 5&#160;years of age.</p>
			<p class="h2">Treatment</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Optical correction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optical correction of the refractive error caused by lens dislocation is often difficult. With mild subluxation, the patient may be only myopic, and corrected visual function may be good. More severe dislocation &#173;causes optical distortion, &#173;because the patient is looking through the far periphery of the lens. &#173;Because the resultant myopic astigmatism is difficult to mea&#173;sure accurately by retinoscopy or automated refractometry, using an aphakic correction may provide the patient with better vision, as long as the subluxated lens does not fill the pupillary space. Refraction before and &#173;after pupil dilation is often helpful for selecting the best type of optical correction. If satisfactory visual function cannot be achieved with glasses or if visual function worsens, lens removal should be considered.</p>
			<p class="h3">Surgery</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Subluxated lenses can be removed &#173;either from the anterior segment through a limbal incision or posteriorly through the pars plana. In most circumstances, complete lensectomy is indicated. Lens removal is easier when the lens is not severely subluxated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the United States, contact lenses or glasses are usually used for postoperative &#173;vision rehabilitation, with good visual results. Anterior chamber or scleral-&#173;fixated IOLs are sometimes implanted. The latter should be used with caution if sutures are used for fixation &#173;because of the high rate of suture breakage. Iris-&#173;claw lenses (Artisan; OPHTEC BV, Groningen, the Netherlands) are widely used in other countries and are currently &#173;under investigation in the United States.</p>
