			<p class="body-text--no-indent- ParaOverride-2">A vertical deviation can be termed a hyperdeviation of the higher eye or a hypodeviation of the lower, fellow eye. By convention, vertical deviations are named according to the hypertropic eye. However, the term <span class="italic">hypotropia of the nonfixating eye</span> is used to describe the patient who has a strong fixation preference for the hypertropic eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgical treatment of &#173;these conditions is discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14.</span></p>
			<p class="h1">A Clinical Approach to Vertical Deviations</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The evaluation and diagnosis of vertical deviations are complicated by the need to consider <span class="italic">dissociated vertical deviation (DVD)</span>. In a patient with a completely comitant deviation, &#173;there is no movement of &#173;either eye on prism alternate cover testing with the same amount of prism used for &#173;either eye (prism placed base down over one eye or base up over the other). When &#173;there is an incomitant hyperdeviation due to restriction or cyclovertical muscle paresis, the amount of prism needed to neutralize the deviation may be dif&#173;fer&#173;ent depending on which eye is fixating. This is the difference between a primary and secondary deviation according to Hering’s law (see Chapter&#160;4). Once the neutralizing prism for a given eye is found, however, neither eye moves when alternate cover testing is performed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In some cases, the examiner encounters a more confusing situation that appears to violate Hering’s law. For example, suppose the examiner finds the prism that neutralizes a patient’s right hypertropia. That is, if the prism is held over an occluded right eye with the left eye fixating, &#173;there is no movement of the right eye when the occluder is moved to the left eye, and fixation switches to the right eye. However, when the occluder is moved back to the right eye, the left eye moves (&#173;either upward from a hypotropic position &#173;under cover or downward from a hypertropic position) as it resumes fixation. This inability to find a single prism that neutralizes the refixation movement for both eyes indicates the presence of DVD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some patients have both “true” hypertropia and DVD. In &#173;these patients, &#173;there is no way to quantify how much of the deviation is DVD and how much is true hypertropia, although several estimation methods have been advocated. Often, however, one is predominant and the other, smaller component can be ignored. For the sake of simplicity, this chapter does not discuss true hypertropia and DVD in combination but only as separate entities.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Vertical Deviations With Marked Horizontal Incomitance</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many vertical deviations are characterized by a hypertropia that is much greater on gaze to one side. They are often, but not exclusively, associated with oblique muscle abnormalities.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Overelevation and Overdepression in Adduction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There are several &#173;causes of overelevation in adduction (OEAd) and overdepression in adduction (ODAd) (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Tables&#160;11-1, 11-2</span>). &#173;These include true overaction and underaction of the oblique muscles, as well as several conditions that can simulate oblique muscle overactions. &#173;These cases have also been termed <span class="italic">oblique muscle pseudo-&#173;overactions.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">In some patients, such as &#173;those with large-&#173;angle exotropia or thyroid eye disease, clinical examination of versions appears to show overaction of both the superior and the inferior oblique muscles. In such cases, elevation or depression of the vertical rectus muscle of the opposite, abducting eye is restricted in the lateral portion of the bony orbit. The clinical findings can be explained as an attempt by the vertical rectus muscle to overcome this restriction through extra innervation, which, according to Hering’s law, is distributed to the yoke oblique muscle as well (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4</span>). Alternatively, overelevation may be due to slippage of a tight lateral rectus muscle as the eye adducts and rises above or below the midline (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Malposition of the rectus muscle pulleys can lead to anomalous movements that can simulate oblique muscle overactions. This can be seen in craniofacial syndromes. For example, an inferiorly displaced lateral rectus muscle pulley can cause depression in abduction or, if this is the fixating eye, OEAd of the contralateral eye and a V-&#173;pattern deviation that simulate inferior oblique muscle overaction. Conversely, a superiorly displaced lateral rectus muscle can produce ODAd—&#173;simulating a superior oblique overaction—&#173;along with an A-&#173;pattern deviation. Lateral and medial malpositioning of vertical rectus muscles can also create pseudo-&#173;overactions of oblique muscles. The treatment implication is that apparent oblique dysfunction or A and V patterns associated with anomalous pulley positions respond poorly to oblique muscle surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Other &#173;causes of OEAd and ODAd include the upshoots and downshoots of Duane retraction syndrome, superior or inferior rectus muscle restriction (causing extra innervation of contralateral oblique muscles), limitation of elevation in abduction &#173;after inferior oblique anterior transposition (anti-&#173;elevation syndrome), and rare cases of Brown syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Inferior oblique muscle overaction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Overaction of the inferior oblique muscle is one cause of OEAd. The overaction is termed <span class="italic">primary</span> when it is not associated with superior oblique muscle palsy. It is called <span class="italic">secondary</span> when it accompanies palsy of the superior oblique muscle or the contralateral superior rectus muscle. The eye is elevated in adduction, both on horizontal movement and in upgaze (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">One explanation of primary overaction relates to vestibular &#173;factors governing postural tonus of the extraocular muscles. Some authors have questioned &#173;whether primary inferior oblique overaction truly exists, preferring to describe the movement merely as OEAd.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-6"><span class="h4-head">Clinical features</span> Primary inferior oblique muscle overaction has been reported to develop between ages 1 and 6&#160;years in up to two-&#173;thirds of patients with infantile strabismus (esotropia or exotropia). It also occurs, less frequently, in association with acquired esotropia or exotropia and, occasionally, in patients with no other strabismus. Bilateral overaction can be asymmetric, often in patients with poor vision in 1 eye, which leads to greater overaction in that eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">With the eyes in lateral gaze, alternate cover testing shows that the higher (adducting) eye refixates with a downward movement and that the lower (abducting) eye refixates with an upward movement. When inferior oblique muscle overaction is bilateral, the higher and lower eyes reverse their direction of movement in the opposite lateral gaze. &#173;These features differentiate inferior oblique overaction from DVD, in which neither eye refixates with an upward movement, &#173;whether adducted, abducted, or in primary position. A V-&#173;pattern horizontal deviation (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>) and extorsion are common with overacting inferior oblique muscles.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Management</span> For cases in which inferior oblique overaction produces a functional prob&#173;lem—&#173;V-pattern strabismus, hypertropia in primary position, or symptomatic hypertropia in side gaze—&#173;a procedure to weaken the inferior oblique muscle (recession, disinsertion, myectomy, or anterior transposition) is indicated. Some surgeons grade the weakening procedure according to the severity of the overaction. Weakening of the inferior oblique muscles generally has an insignificant effect on horizontal alignment in primary position.</p>
			<p class="h3">Superior oblique muscle overaction</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Superior oblique muscle overaction is one of several &#173;causes of ODAd.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Clinical features</span> A vertical deviation in primary position often occurs with unilateral or asymmetric bilateral overaction of the superior oblique muscles. The lower eye has the overacting superior oblique muscle in unilateral overaction and the more prominently overacting superior oblique in bilateral cases. The overacting superior oblique muscle &#173;causes a hypotropia of the adducting eye, which is accentuated in the lower field of gaze (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-2</span>). A horizontal deviation, most often exotropia, may be pres&#173;ent and may lead to an A pattern (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;10</span>). Intorsion is common with superior oblique muscle over&#173;action. Most cases of bilateral superior oblique overaction are primary overactions.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Management</span> In a patient with clinically significant hypertropia or hypotropia or an A pattern, a procedure to weaken the superior oblique tendon (recession, tenotomy, tenectomy, or lengthening by insertion of a silicone spacer or nonabsorbable suture or by split-&#173;tendon lengthening) is appropriate. Significant intorsion &#173;will also be reduced with any of &#173;these procedures. Many surgeons are reluctant to perform superior oblique tendon weakening in patients with fusion &#173;because torsional or asymmetric vertical effects can cause diplopia. As with inferior oblique muscle overaction, the horizontal deviation can be corrected during the same operative session. Some surgeons, anticipating a convergent effect in primary position, alter the amount of horizontal rectus muscle surgery when si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously weakening the superior oblique muscles.</p>
			<p class="h2">Superior Oblique Muscle Palsy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common paralysis of a single cyclovertical muscle is fourth nerve (trochlear) palsy, which involves the superior oblique muscle. The palsy can be congenital or acquired; if the latter, it is usually a result of closed head trauma or, less commonly, vascular prob&#173;lems of the central ner&#173;vous system, diabetes mellitus, or a brain tumor. Direct trauma to the tendon or the trochlear area is an occasional cause of unilateral superior oblique muscle palsy. Results of one study showed that most patients with congenital superior oblique palsy had an absent ipsilateral trochlear nerve and varying degrees of superior oblique muscle hypoplasia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The same clinical features (discussed in the next section) can be observed when &#173;there is a congenitally lax, attenuated, or even absent superior oblique tendon or an unusual course of the muscle, or when &#173;there are malpositioned orbital pulleys—&#173;although, strictly speaking, &#173;these are not paralytic entities. Superior oblique muscle underaction can also occur in several craniofacial abnormalities (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;18</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">To differentiate congenital from acquired superior oblique muscle palsy, the clinician can examine childhood photo&#173;graphs of the patient for a preexisting compensatory head tilt, although manifestations of congenital palsy sometimes become apparent only &#173;later in life. The presence of a large vertical fusional amplitude supports a diagnosis of congenital superior oblique palsy, whereas associated neurologic disorders suggest an acquired condition. Facial asymmetry from long-&#173;standing head tilting indicates chronicity. Diagnostic evaluation, including neuroimaging, often fails to identify an etiology but may still be warranted for acquired superior oblique palsy without a history of trauma. Neurologic aspects of superior oblique muscle palsy are discussed in BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology.</span></p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single ParaOverride-6">Yang HK, Kim JH, Hwang JM. Congenital superior oblique palsy and trochlear nerve absence: a clinical and radiological study. <span class="italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2012;119(1):170–177.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Either the normal or the affected eye can be preferred for fixation. Examination of versions usually reveals underaction of the involved superior oblique muscle and overaction of its antagonist inferior oblique muscle; however, the action of the superior oblique muscle can appear normal.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Unilateral superior oblique palsy</span> In a unilateral palsy, the hyperdeviation is typically incomitant, especially in the acute stages. Over time, contracture of the ipsilateral superior rectus or contralateral inferior rectus muscle can lead to “spread of comitance,” with the result that &#173;there is minimal difference in the magnitude of the hypertropia when the patient looks from one side to the other. If depression cannot be evaluated &#173;because of the eye’s inability to adduct (eg, in third nerve palsy), superior oblique muscle function can be evaluated by observing &#173;whether the eye intorts, as judged by the movement of surface landmarks or examination of the fundus, when the patient attempts to look downward and inward from primary position. Weakness of the superior oblique muscle also results in extorsion of the eye. If the degree of extorsion is large enough, subjective incyclodiplopia, in which the patient describes the image as appearing to tilt inward, can occur.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of unilateral superior oblique muscle palsy is further established by results of the 3-&#173;step test (also called the <span class="italic">Parks-&#173;Bielschowsky 3-&#173;step test</span>) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-3</span>; see also <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7, Fig 7-8</span>) and the double Maddox rod test to mea&#173;sure torsion. However, results of the 3-&#173;step test can be confounded in patients with DVD, entities involving restriction, additional paretic muscles, previous strabismus surgery, or skew deviation. Intorsion of the higher eye on fundus examination—&#173;instead of the expected extorsion—&#173;suggests skew deviation, especially when &#173;there are associated neurologic findings. In addition, if the patient is placed in a supine position, the vertical tropia is more likely to decrease with skew deviation than with superior oblique palsy. Some ophthalmologists document serial changes in the deviation by means of the Hess screen or the Lancaster red-&#173;green test or by plotting the field of single binocular vision. (See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;7 for further discussion of some of the tests mentioned in this section.</span>)</p>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">inhibitional palsy of the contralateral antagonist</span> Patients who fixate with the paretic eye can exhibit so-&#173;called <span class="italic">inhibitional palsy of the contralateral antagonist</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-4</span>). If a patient with right superior oblique palsy uses the right eye to fixate on an object that is located up and to the left, the innervation of the right inferior oblique muscle required to move the eye into this gaze position is reduced &#173;because the right inferior oblique muscle does not have to overcome the normal antagonistic effect of the right superior oblique muscle (Sherrington’s law). According to Hering’s law, less innervation is also received by the yoke muscle of the right inferior oblique muscle, which is the left superior rectus muscle. This decreased innervation can lead to the impression that the left superior rectus muscle is paretic.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Bilateral superior oblique palsy</span> Bilateral superior oblique palsy occurs commonly &#173;after head trauma but is sometimes congenital. It can be differentiated from unilateral superior oblique muscle palsy by the following criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">Unilateral</span> cases usually show &#173;little if any V pattern and less than 10° of extorsion in downgaze. Subjective incyclodiplopia is uncommon. The Bielschowsky head-tilt test (step 3 of the 3-&#173;step test) yields positive results for the involved side only. Abnormal head positions—&#173;usually a tilt &#173;toward the shoulder opposite the side of the weakness—&#173;are common. The oblique muscle dysfunction is confined to the involved eye.</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid"><span class="italic">Bilateral</span> cases usually show a V pattern. Extorsion is 10° or more in downgaze; more than 15° of extorsion in primary position is highly suggestive of bilateral involvement. Subjective incyclodiplopia is common in acquired bilateral cases. The Bielschowsky head-&#173;tilt test yields positive results on tilt to each side—&#173;that is, right head tilt produces a right hypertropia and left head tilt, a left hypertropia. &#173;There is bilateral oblique muscle dysfunction. Patients may exhibit a chin-&#173;down head position. Symmetric palsies may show &#173;little or no hypertropia in primary position.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h5-text"><span class="h5-head">masked bilateral superior oblique palsy</span> Markedly asymmetric bilateral superior oblique palsy that initially appears to be unilateral is called <span class="italic">masked bilateral palsy.</span> Signs of masked bilateral palsy include bilateral objective fundus extorsion, esotropia in downgaze, and even the mildest degree of oblique muscle dysfunction on the presumably uninvolved side. Masked bilateral palsy is more common in patients with head trauma. Surgical overcorrection of unilateral superior oblique palsy can produce a pattern of hypertropia and 3-&#173;step-&#173;test findings similar to those of superior oblique palsy in the contralateral eye and should not be mistaken for masked bilateral palsy.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">For small, symptomatic deviations that lack a prominent torsional component—&#173;especially &#173;those that have become comitant—&#173;prisms that compensate for the hyperdeviation in primary position may be used to overcome diplopia. Abnormal head position, significant vertical deviation, diplopia, and asthenopia are indications for surgery. Common operative strategies are discussed in the following sections (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;14 for details of the procedures and for related videos</span>).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Unilateral superior oblique muscle palsy</span> &#173;There are many options for surgical treatment of a unilateral palsy. Any of the 4 cyclovertical muscles in each eye could potentially be operated on to correct the hypertropia. Some surgeons use a uniform approach and weaken the ipsilateral antagonist inferior oblique muscle. For other surgeons, the surgical plan is informed by superior oblique tendon laxity. Tendon laxity is assessed at the time of surgery by forced duction testing, in which the globe is pushed (translated) posteriorly into the orbit while it is si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously extorted, thus placing the superior oblique tendon on stretch (Video 11-1). If the tendon is lax, they perform a superior oblique tightening procedure; if it is not, they usually perform an inferior oblique weakening procedure. &#173;Other ophthalmologists use tendon laxity only as diagnostic confirmation of superior oblique palsy.</p>

			<p class="body-text">Many surgeons take a tailored approach, reflecting the variety of hypertropia patterns that may occur with superior oblique palsy. For example, if underaction of an affected right superior oblique muscle is the most prominent feature, then the deviation &#173;will be greatest in down-&#173;left gaze. Another patient, by contrast, may predominantly exhibit overaction of the antagonist inferior oblique muscle, with the greatest deviation in up-&#173;left gaze. &#173;Because each of the 8 cyclovertical muscles has a somewhat dif&#173;fer&#173;ent field of action, surgery involving some muscles &#173;will be more appropriate than &#173;others, depending on the field of gaze in which the deviation is largest (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;11-3</span>). In addition, some surgeons believe that superior oblique tightening is the most effective procedure for addressing a marked head tilt in &#173;children with congenital superior oblique palsy. Extorsion in unilateral superior oblique palsy rarely produces symptoms, but when it does, it can be corrected with a Harada-&#173;Ito procedure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the hyperdeviation is greater than 15 prism diopters (<span class="greek--tx-">Δ</span>) in primary position, surgery usually involves at least 2 muscles. Ipsilateral inferior oblique weakening and superior oblique tightening represent a particularly power&#173;ful combination but carry an increased risk of problematic iatrogenic Brown syndrome or overcorrection. In the unusually severe case with a vertical deviation greater than 35<span class="greek--tx-">Δ</span> in primary position, 3-&#173;muscle surgery is usually required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">What&#173;ever the approach, it is impor&#173;tant to avoid overcorrection of a long-&#173;standing unilateral superior oblique muscle palsy. &#173;Because &#173;there are often no sensory or motor adaptations to hypertropia in the opposite direction, disabling diplopia can result.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Bilateral superior oblique muscle palsy</span> Surgical planning for treatment of bilateral superior oblique muscle palsy can be complex. If the paresis is asymmetric, hypertropia in primary position may be pres&#173;ent and require many of the same considerations as hypertropia in unilateral palsy. In addition, &#173;there is often symptomatic extorsion or a V pattern that needs to be addressed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the palsies are symmetric (minimal hypertropia in primary position), both inferior oblique muscles can be weakened if they are overacting and hypertropia is pres&#173;ent in side gaze. Bilateral superior oblique muscle tightening should be performed when hypertropia in side gaze is accompanied by V-pattern esotropia or symptomatic extorsion, especially in downgaze. If &#173;there is symptomatic extorsion but minimal hypertropia in side gaze, bilateral Harada-&#173;Ito procedures can be performed. Other, less commonly used approaches, such as bilateral inferior rectus muscle recessions, serve to add extra innervational drive on downgaze to help overcome the superior oblique deficits.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Inferior Oblique Muscle Palsy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Whether inferior oblique muscle palsy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-5</span>) actually exists has been questioned. Most cases are considered to be congenital or posttraumatic.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Inferior oblique palsy is suspected when the patient has hypotropia and 3-&#173;step-&#173;test results consistent with this diagnosis. As with Brown syndrome, a prominent feature is deficient elevation when the eye is in adduction. The features that distinguish inferior oblique palsy from Brown syndrome are listed in <span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;11-4</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-8">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Indications for treatment of inferior oblique muscle palsy are abnormal head position, vertical deviation in primary position, and diplopia. Management consists of weakening &#173;either the ipsilateral superior oblique muscle or the contralateral superior rectus muscle.</p>
			<p class="h2">Skew Deviation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Skew deviation is an acquired vertical strabismus that can mimic superior or inferior oblique palsy. The deviation is due to peripheral or central asymmetric disruption of supranuclear input from the otolith organs. Intorsion of the hypertropic eye on fundus examination—&#173;rather than the expected extorsion in superior oblique palsy—&#173;suggests skew deviation, particularly when &#173;there are associated neurologic findings. In addition, if the patient is placed in a supine position, the vertical tropia is more likely to decrease with skew deviation than with superior oblique palsy. Similarly, if &#173;there is extorsion of the hypotropic eye on fundus examination—&#173;instead of the expected intorsion in inferior oblique palsy—&#173;then skew deviation is the likely diagnosis. See BCSC Section&#160;5, <span class="italic">Neuro-&#173;Ophthalmology,</span> for additional discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Other Conditions With Incomitant Vertical Deviations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Incomitant hypertropia may occur in several other conditions. &#173;These include innervational prob&#173;lems, such as third nerve palsy with aberrant regeneration and the upshoots and downshoots in Duane retraction syndrome; and mechanical disorders, such as Brown syndrome and thyroid eye disease or &#173;those due to orbital tumors and orbital implants (eg, tube shunts, scleral buckles). &#173;These topics are discussed elsewhere in this book and in other BCSC volumes.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-9">Vertical Deviations With Horizontal Comitance</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most patients with vertical deviations demonstrate some lateral incomitance. However, in vertical deviations not associated with apparent oblique muscle dysfunction, the difference between the deviations in right gaze and left gaze is usually less than 10<span class="accent">Δ</span>.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Monocular Elevation Deficiency</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Monocular elevation deficiency (previously termed <span class="italic">double-&#173;elevator palsy</span>) involves a limitation of upward gaze with a hypotropia that is similar in adduction and abduction. &#173;There are 3 forms of this motility pattern, each with a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent cause: restriction of the inferior rectus muscle; deficient innervation of elevator muscles (paresis of 1 or both elevator muscles or a monocular supranuclear gaze disorder); a combination of restriction and elevator muscle deficit.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">All 3 forms of monocular elevation deficiency are characterized by hypotropia of the involved eye with limited elevation, a chin-up head position with binocular fusion in downgaze, and ptosis or pseudoptosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-6</span>). True ptosis is pres&#173;ent in 50% of affected patients. &#173;These are features of third nerve palsy, as well. Therefore, if any other feature of third nerve palsy is pres&#173;ent, that condition should be suspected rather than monocular elevation deficiency.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical features of each form of monocular elevation deficiency are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">restriction<ul><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">positive forced duction on elevation</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">normal force generation and saccadic velocity (no muscle paralysis)</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">often an extra or deeper lower eyelid fold on attempted upgaze</li><li class="bullet-list-sub-bullet-list _idGenParaOverride-1">poor or absent Bell phenomenon</li></ul></li>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">In support of this classification, studies using magnetic resonance imaging have shown &#173;either focal thickening of the inferior rectus muscle, supporting a restrictive etiology, or normal ocular motor nerves, suggesting a central unilateral disorder of upgaze.</p>

			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Indications for treatment include a large vertical deviation in primary position, with or without ptosis, and an abnormal chin-up head position. If restriction originating inferiorly is pres&#173;ent, the inferior rectus muscle should be recessed. If &#173;there is no restriction, the medial and lateral rectus muscles can be transposed &#173;toward the superior rectus muscle <span class="italic">(Knapp procedure).</span> Alternatively, the surgeon can recess the ipsilateral inferior rectus and &#173;either recess the contralateral superior rectus muscle or resect the ipsilateral superior rectus muscle. Ptosis surgery should be deferred &#173;until the vertical deviation has been corrected and the pseudoptosis component eliminated.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Orbital Floor Fractures</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Clinical features and management of orbital floor fractures are discussed in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;27</span> of this volume and in BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span> The discussion in this chapter focuses on motility abnormalities in patients with &#173;these fractures.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diplopia in the immediate postinjury stage is common and not necessarily an indication for urgent intervention. Indications and timing for surgical repair are discussed in Chapter&#160;27 of this volume and in BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System</span>. Depending on the site of the bony trauma, muscles can be &#173;either restricted due to entrapment or paretic due to muscle contusion or nerve damage. “Flap tears” of the inferior rectus muscle have also been described by some authors as a cause of limitation of elevation, depression, or both. Paresis of a muscle may resolve over several months. If the fracture requires surgery, the range of eye movements may improve. By contrast, fibrosis &#173;after trauma may cause restriction to persist even &#173;after successful repair of the fracture.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of strabismus is usually necessary when diplopia persists in primary position or downgaze or &#173;there is an associated compensatory head position. Some mild limitations of eye movements can be managed with prisms.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Planning of eye muscle surgery depends on the fields where diplopia is pres&#173;ent and on the relative contributions of muscle restriction and paresis. Any flap tear discovered on exploration of the inferior rectus muscle should be repaired. For hypotropia in primary position (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-7</span>), recession of the ipsilateral inferior rectus muscle can be effective, especially if the muscle is restricted on forced duction testing. Similarly, an incomitant esotropia (with diplopia on side gaze) due to restriction on the medial side may be improved by recession of the ipsilateral medial rectus muscle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Initially, hypertropia due to weakness of the inferior rectus muscle without entrapment is managed with observation &#173;because the weakness may improve with time. If recovery is not complete within 6–12 months of the injury and &#173;there is at least a moderate degree of active force, resection of the affected muscle can be performed. If the hypertropia is large, the procedure can be combined with recession of the ipsilateral superior rectus muscle or recession of the contralateral inferior rectus muscle, with or without the addition of a posterior fixation suture <span class="italic">(</span><span class="italic">fadenoperation)</span>. Transposition of the ipsilateral medial and lateral rectus muscles to the inferior rectus muscle <span class="italic">(inverse Knapp procedure)</span> may be necessary for treatment of complete, chronic inferior rectus muscle palsy or when a crippling amount of recession has been necessary to relieve restriction.</p>
			<p class="h2">Other Conditions With Comitant Vertical Deviations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Other conditions and disorders featuring a hypertropia that does not change markedly from right to left gaze include innervational prob&#173;lems, such as superior division (partial) palsy of the third cranial nerve; and mechanical disorders, such as thyroid eye disease, congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles, and orbital tumors. &#173;These topics are discussed elsewhere in this volume and in other BCSC Sections.</p>

			<p class="h1">Dissociated Vertical Deviation</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is an innervational disorder found in more than 50% of patients with infantile strabismus (esotropia or exotropia). &#173;There are 2 explanations for the origin of DVD. One theory is that DVD is a vertical vergence movement to damp latent nystagmus, with the oblique muscles playing the principal role. An alternative theory suggests that deficient fusion allows the primitive dorsal light reflex, which is prominent in other species, to emerge.</p>
			<p class="reference--journal--first ParaOverride-10">Brodsky MC. Dissociated vertical divergence: a righting reflex gone wrong. <span class="italic">Arch Ophthalmol.</span> 1999;117(9):1216–1222.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Clinical Features</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dissociated vertical deviation usually pres&#173;ents by age 2&#160;years, &#173;whether or not any horizontal deviation has been surgically corrected. &#173;Either eye slowly drifts upward and outward, with simultaneous extorsion, when occluded or during periods of visual inattention (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;</span><span class="xref-figure">11-8</span>). Some patients attempt to compensate by tilting the head, for reasons that still have not been conclusively identified.</p>
			<p class="body-text">DVD is usually the most prominent component of the <span class="italic">dissociated strabismus complex (DSC),</span> but sometimes the principal dissociated movement is one of abduction <span class="italic">(dissociated horizontal deviation, DHD),</span> and occasionally it is almost entirely a torsional movement <span class="italic">(dissociated torsional deviation, DTD).</span> DVD is usually bilateral but is frequently asymmetric. It may occur spontaneously (manifest DVD) or only when 1 eye is occluded (latent DVD). An eye with latent DVD can give the appearance of inferior oblique overaction when it is occluded by the nose during adduction. In addition to DHD, latent nystagmus and horizontal strabismus are often associated with DVD. &#173;These entities are manifestations of deficient binocular vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of DVD is difficult and imprecise. In one method, a base-&#173;down prism is placed in front of the upwardly deviating eye while it is &#173;behind an occluder. The occluder is then switched to the fixating lower eye. The prism power is adjusted &#173;until the deviating eye shows no downward movement to refixate. &#173;These steps are then repeated for the other eye. Mea&#173;sure&#173;ments obtained with this technique are confounded by any coexisting true hypertropia, but it does provide a rough estimate for surgical planning.</p>
			<p class="h2">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Treatment of DVD is indicated if the deviation is noticeable (generally more than 6<span class="greek--tx-">Δ</span>–8<span class="greek--tx-">Δ</span>) and occurs frequently during the day. When DVD is unilateral or highly asymmetric, encouraging fixation by the eye with greater DVD by optically blurring the fellow eye is sometimes sufficient. &#173;Because DVD can mimic OEAd, distinguishing it from overaction of the inferior oblique muscles is impor&#173;tant, as the surgical approaches to &#173;these 2 conditions are dif&#173;fer&#173;ent in most cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgery on the vertical muscles often improves the condition but rarely eliminates it. Recessions of the superior rectus muscle, ranging from 6 to 10&#160;mm according to the size of the hypertropia, can be effective. If &#173;there is residual DVD &#173;after superior rectus muscle recession, inferior rectus muscle resection or plication can be performed. Inferior oblique muscle anterior transposition is also effective in treating DVD, especially if it is accompanied by inferior oblique muscle overaction. Bilateral surgery is performed whenever both eyes can fixate; asymmetric surgery is an option if the DVD is asymmetric.</p>

When gaze is up and left (2), the RIO needs less-than-normal innervation to elevate the right eye because its antagonist, the RSO, is palsied. Consequently, its yoke, the LSR, will be apparently underacting, and pseudoptosis with pseudopalsy of the LSR will be present.
