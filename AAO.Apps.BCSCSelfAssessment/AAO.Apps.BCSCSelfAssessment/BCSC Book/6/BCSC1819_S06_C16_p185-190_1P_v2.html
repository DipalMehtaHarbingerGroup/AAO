			<p class="chapter-title">Decreased Vision in Infants and Pediatric Vision Rehabilitation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When an infant has not developed good visual attention or the ability to fixate on and follow objects by 3–4 months of age, the clinician must determine &#173;whether the decreased vision is due to an ocular or optic nerve (pregeniculate) condition, ce&#173;re&#173;bral (retrogeniculate) visual impairment, or delayed visual maturation. This chapter discusses the classification of visual impairment in infants and &#173;children, as well as the evaluation and rehabilitation of &#173;these patients.</p>
			<p class="h1">Visual Development in Young Infants</p>
			<div id="Chapt16_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Visual development is a highly complex maturational pro&#173;cess. Structural changes occur in both the eye and the central ner&#173;vous system. Laboratory and clinical research has shown that normal vision develops as a result of both genet&#173;ically programmed neural development and normal early visual experience.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A blink reflex to bright light should be pres&#173;ent within a few days of birth. The pupillary light reflex is usually pres&#173;ent &#173;after 31 weeks’ gestation but can be difficult to evaluate in the early neonatal period &#173;because the newborn’s pupils are miotic.</p>
			<p class="body-text">At approximately 6–8 weeks of age, the healthy full-&#173;term infant should be able to make and maintain eye contact with other &#173;humans and react with facial expressions. Infants aged 2–3 months should be interested in bright objects. By age 3–4 months, the nasal bias for smooth pursuit should have resolved, the eyes should be orthotropic, and fix-&#173;and-&#173;follow responses to a small (2–4 inches in dia&#173;meter) toy should be pres&#173;ent. Premature infants can be expected to reach &#173;these landmarks &#173;later, but &#173;there is not an exact week-&#173;for-&#173;week correlation for the attainment of &#173;these milestones.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Dysconjugate eye movements, skew deviation, and <span class="italic">sunsetting</span> (tonic downward deviation of both eyes) may be noted in healthy newborns but should not persist beyond approximately 3–4 months of age. Signs of poor visual development include searching eye movements, lack of response to familiar &#173;faces and objects, and nystagmus. Staring at bright lights and forceful rubbing or poking of the eyes <span class="italic">(oculodigital reflex)</span> in an other&#173;wise visually disinterested infant are other signs of poor vision and suggest an ocular cause for the deficiency.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Classification of Visual Impairment in Infants and Children</p>
			<div id="Chapt16_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The distinction between pregeniculate and ce&#173;re&#173;bral visual impairment can be helpful in the context of infants who pres&#173;ent with poor vision, although it should be recognized that some disorders cause both pregeniculate and retrogeniculate pathology. In addition, in some children, poor visual behavior normalizes over time, a phenomenon known as <span class="italic">delayed visual maturation.</span></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Pregeniculate Visual Impairment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pregeniculate visual impairment results from pathology anterior to the lateral geniculate nucleus (the pregeniculate visual pathways). &#173;Causes of pregeniculate visual impairment in infants include corneal and lens opacities, glaucoma, ret&#173;i&#173;nal disorders, and optic nerve or optic tract abnormalities; &#173;these conditions are covered in detail elsewhere in this volume.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Ce&#173;re&#173;bral Visual Impairment</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ce&#173;re&#173;bral visual impairment (<span class="italic">CVI;</span> also termed <span class="italic">retrogeniculate visual impairment</span>) is the most frequent cause of childhood visual impairment in developed countries. The visual deficit results from pathology posterior to the lateral geniculate nucleus (retrogeniculate visual pathways). CVI is often referred to as <span class="italic">cortical visual impairment,</span> but the term &#173;<span class="italic">ce&#173;re&#173;bral</span> is preferred &#173;because both subcortical (optic radiations) and cortical pathology can result in similar visual impairment. CVI can be transient or permanent and can be an isolated finding or associated with multiple neurologic deficits. Partial improvement in visual be&#173;hav&#173;ior may occur over the first few years of life.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CVI can be congenital or acquired. Prenatal and perinatal &#173;causes include intrauterine infection, structural central ner&#173;vous system abnormalities, intracranial hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia (a prominent cause of visual impairment in premature &#173;children), hypoxia, seizures, and hydrocephalus. Acquired &#173;causes include accidental trauma, abusive head trauma, meningitis, and encephalitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Infants with CVI show variable degrees of impairment, from mildly decreased visual be&#173;hav&#173;ior to roving eye movements with complete absence of response to visual stimulation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Delayed Visual Maturation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">If normal visual fixation and tracking do not develop within the first 3–4 months of life, visual be&#173;hav&#173;ior may still normalize subsequently; this condition is termed <span class="italic">delayed visual maturation (DVM),</span> or <span class="italic">cortical inattention.</span> &#173;There are 3 subgroups of infants with DVM: other&#173;wise healthy infants; infants with systemic or neurologic abnormalities; and infants with associated ocular disorders presenting with poor vision out of proportion to the ocular condition.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In an other&#173;wise healthy infant with suspected DVM, the following findings suggest a good visual and neurologic prognosis: some reaction to light, normal pupillary responses, no nystagmus, and normal ocular structures. If the visual be&#173;hav&#173;ior does not pro&#173;gress &#173;toward normal by 4–6 months of age, further investigation is warranted to assess for other &#173;causes of per&#173;sis&#173;tent visual impairment.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Evaluation of the Infant With Decreased Vision</p>
			<div id="Chapt16_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;Family history may identify hereditary &#173;causes of pregeniculate visual impairment. Details of the pregnancy are impor&#173;tant; &#173;factors such as in utero exposure to infection, drugs, alcohol, or radiation; trauma; and maternal diabetes mellitus may predispose to pregeniculate impairment and/or CVI. Perinatal prob&#173;lems such as prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, fetal distress, bradycardia, meconium staining, and oxygen deprivation may be associated with CVI. In addition, the clinician should inquire about systemic abnormalities, delayed developmental milestones, and postnatal &#173;causes of brain injury.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Parental observations of the child’s visual be&#173;hav&#173;ior should be noted. In a child with CVI, visual attentiveness may fluctuate widely; the &#173;family may report that the child sometimes seems to see and at other times does not appear to see at all.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vision in the infant is assessed qualitatively by clinical appraisal and optokinetic nystagmus responses, and quantitatively by preferential looking tests—&#173;for example, Teller Acuity Cards II (Stereo Optical, Inc, Chicago, IL) or the Cardiff Acuity Test—&#173;and visual evoked potential (VEP); see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;1 for a discussion of &#173;these quantitative tests</span>. VEP results may be &#173;either normal or subnormal in CVI. Infants with ocular motor apraxia (see Chapter&#160;12) may falsely appear to have poor vision due to impaired horizontal eye movements, but vertical movements are usually spared.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pupillary responses are sluggish with certain pregeniculate &#173;causes of visual impairment such as ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophies and optic nerve abnormalities. Paradoxical pupils (pupillary constriction in response to darkness) can occur with &#173;these conditions. In contrast, pupillary responses are normal in infants with CVI.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the setting of poor vision, nystagmus in infancy should raise suspicion for sensory nystagmus due to a pregeniculate disorder (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span>). Conversely, poor visual be&#173;hav&#173;ior with normal ocular examination results, normal pupillary responses, and no nystagmus by 3 months of age is more likely to represent CVI or DVM. Congenital motor nystagmus usually does not pres&#173;ent with poor vision but is occasionally associated with DVM.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Anterior segment and fundus examinations may reveal a pregeniculate cause of the visual impairment, such as bilateral cataracts, bilateral macular colobomas or scars, bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia, bilateral optic atrophy, or foveal hypoplasia with or without albinism or aniridia. However, some ret&#173;i&#173;nal &#173;causes of pregeniculate visual impairment may not be associated with any vis&#173;i&#173;ble abnormalities on fundus examination. Sometimes optic nerve abnormalities may be pres&#173;ent even though the primary cause of visual impairment is CVI: descending optic atrophy (from transsynaptic degeneration) may coexist with CVI, and in preterm infants, optic disc cupping resembling that seen in glaucoma can occur as a result of transsynaptic degeneration, most commonly secondary to periventricular leukomalacia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If the ocular examination is unrevealing yet suspicion is high for a pregeniculate cause of visual impairment (eg, when poor vision is accompanied by nystagmus), then electroretinography (ERG) may be indicated to diagnose a ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophy. ERG results are normal in CVI.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Neuroimaging studies in CVI may be normal, in which case the visual prognosis tends to be more favorable, or may reveal changes such as ce&#173;re&#173;bral atrophy, porencephaly in the occipital (striate or parastriate) cortex, damage to the optic radiations, or periventricular leukomalacia.</p>

			<p class="h1">Pediatric Low Vision Rehabilitation</p>
			<div id="Chapt16_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vision rehabilitation should be recommended when a child has a visual impairment that affects his or her ability to access the visual environment (as occurs with best-&#173;corrected visual acuity worse than 20/40&#160;in the better-&#173;seeing eye, decreased visual field, central field loss, reduced contrast sensitivity, nyctalopia, or impaired visual pro&#173;cessing). From diagnosis onward, the ophthalmologist plays an impor&#173;tant role in recommending that &#173;children with low vision receive comprehensive vision rehabilitation. Early referral is essential for setting the &#173;family and child on a course to achieve optimal visual per&#173;for&#173;mance, access to instruction, and safe and in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent mobility, and for enabling &#173;children with acquired visual impairment to adjust successfully to vision loss. Even though preschool-&#173;aged &#173;children may function well without any low vision aids, early-&#173;intervention programs can offer impor&#173;tant stimulation and introduce strategies for transition to school.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pediatric vision rehabilitation involves pediatric ophthalmologists, vision rehabilitation clinicians, teachers of the visually impaired (TVI), occupational therapists, teachers, orientation and mobility specialists, technology experts, state socie&#173;ties, and other professionals and organ&#173;izations. In the United States, &#173;a variety of approaches exist to educate &#173;children with visual impairments. Some states have state-&#173;funded residential schools for the visually impaired. Elsewhere, districts may cluster students with visual impairment into one school. More commonly, neighborhood schools work with itinerant TVI. An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) outlines the needs of an individual child in the school setting. The child’s needs at home and in other nonacademic settings must be considered as well.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many &#173;children can function well with partial sight, with the help of low vision aids, whereas &#173;others &#173;will benefit from braille literacy, which is most easily acquired in childhood. &#173;Because most &#173;children have large accommodative amplitudes, enabling them to hold a given object closer than normal to enlarge its ret&#173;i&#173;nal image, magnification may not be necessary for very young patients with low vision. However, accommodative amplitudes decrease and visual demands increase with age (as students are faced with smaller print size), so holding objects closer may not be a sustainable strategy for older &#173;children. Printed material can be enlarged, and dome-&#173;type magnifiers may be helpful for performing near work; video magnification can be used for near-&#173; or distance-&#173;vision tasks. For distance viewing, handheld monocular telescopes may help. Tablets, smartphones, e-&#173;textbooks, and text-&#173;to-&#173;speech conversion have greatly expanded the opportunities available to visually impaired &#173;children and have the benefit of being socially acceptable for older &#173;children trying to fit in with their peers. Table 16-1 lists sources of information on low vision.</p>
