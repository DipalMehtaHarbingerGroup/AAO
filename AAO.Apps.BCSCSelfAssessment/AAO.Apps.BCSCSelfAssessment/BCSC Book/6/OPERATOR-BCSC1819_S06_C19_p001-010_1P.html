			<p class="chapter-title">Lacrimal Drainage System Abnormalities</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) can be congenital or acquired. Congenital NLDO (CNLDO) is the most common lacrimal system disorder encountered in pediatric ophthalmology. This chapter discusses CNLDO, including nonsurgical and surgical management, as well other congenital and developmental anomalies of the lacrimal system that may be treated by the ophthalmologist. Acquired NLDO is discussed in BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, </span><span class="italic">Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Anatomical features of the lacrimal drainage system and their development are discussed in BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Princi&#173;ples of Ophthalmology,</span> and Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>

			<div id="Chapt19_Top1">
			<p class="h2-h1">Atresia of the Lacrimal Puncta or Canaliculi</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Atresia of the lacrimal puncta or canaliculi</span> refers to failure of canalization during development of the upper lacrimal system structures. Patients with atresia usually pres&#173;ent with overflow of clear tears; &#173;there is no infection &#173;because bacteria cannot reach the lacrimal sac to produce one. The presence of mucopurulent discharge in a patient with atresia of &#173;either the upper or lower canaliculus usually indicates concomitant obstruction of the distal NLD, with reflux of discharge through the normal canaliculus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There are 2 main &#173;causes of upper lacrimal system obstruction. One is a thin membrane that obstructs the lacrimal puncta, which are other&#173;wise normal. &#173;Simple puncture of the membrane with a punctal dilator eliminates this obstruction. For concomitant obstruction of the distal NLD, probing of the distal system is necessary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The second cause of upper lacrimal system obstruction is atresia of the puncta and canaliculi. In affected patients, no puncta can be seen (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 19-1</span>). If only 1 of the canaliculi is atretic and &#173;there is mucopurulent discharge, probing of the distal duct through the pa&#173;tent canaliculus may be curative. If both the upper and the lower canaliculi are absent, an incision through the eyelid margin at the expected location of the canaliculi may reveal structures that can be cannulated. However, many patients ultimately require conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy (CDCR), a procedure that creates a complete bypass of the lacrimal drainage system. CDCR is usually deferred &#173;until &#173;these patients are older. See BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> for a discussion of this procedure<span class="italic">.</span></p>
			<p class="h2">Congenital Lacrimal Fistula</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital lacrimal fistula (lacrimal–&#173;cutaneous fistula) is an epithelium-&#173;lined tract extending from the common canaliculus or lacrimal sac to the overlying skin surface. It usually pres&#173;ents as a small dimple medial to the eyelids and may be difficult to detect in the absence of symptoms (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 19-2</span>). It is not always patent. If the patient is asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. Discharge from the fistula is often associated with distal NLDO and may cease &#173;after probing of the distal obstruction. If discharge persists despite a patent lacrimal duct, surgical excision of the fistula between the skin and normal lacrimal structures is required.</p>
			<p class="h2">Dacryocystocele</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital dacryocystocele (dacryocele, mucocele, amniotocele) is pres&#173;ent in approximately 3% of infants with NLDO. It develops when a distal blockage &#173;causes distention of the lacrimal sac. The valve of Rosenm<span class="accent">ü</span>ller can act as a one-&#173;way valve, thereby preventing decompression of the lacrimal sac. Most patients with dacryocystoceles have associated cysts of the distal NLD, which may be seen beneath the inferior turbinate. Involvement is bilateral in 20%–30% of cases.</p>
			<p class="h3">Clinical features and diagnosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dacryocystocele pres&#173;ents at birth or within the first few days of life as a bluish swelling just below and nasal to the medial canthus. The differential diagnosis includes hemangioma, dermoid cyst, and encephalocele. Hemangiomas are not typically pres&#173;ent at birth. They have a vascular appearance and are generally less firm than dacryocystoceles. Dermoid cysts and encephaloceles pres&#173;ent most often above the medial canthal tendon. The diagnosis is clinically apparent when a newborn has a nasal mass beneath the medial canthus that is associated with symptoms of NLDO (discussed &#173;later in the chapter); imaging is usually not required in this case.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Dacryocystoceles are prone to infection, and acute dacryocystitis usually develops. The skin over the distended lacrimal sac becomes erythematous (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 19-3</span>), and pressure applied on the sac may produce reflux of purulent material.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Infants who have large intranasal cysts may pres&#173;ent with respiratory symptoms &#173;because infants are obligate nasal breathers. Symptoms range from difficulty during feeding (due to obstruction of the mouth) to respiratory distress.</p>
			<p class="h3">Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Early treatment of dacryocystoceles is advised to prevent complications related to infection. Infants are relatively immunocompromised and are therefore at risk for local or systemic spread of infection. Digital massage may be attempted to decompress the dacryocystocele, as the condition occasionally resolves without surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Dacryocystoceles associated with acute respiratory distress require immediate surgical intervention. If the lesions do not resolve within the first 1–2 weeks of life or if &#173;there is acute infection of the dacryocystocele, surgery is necessary. NLD probing alone may be curative, but in approximately 25% of patients, the condition persists &#173;after probing. NLD probing in conjunction with nasal endoscopy and intranasal cyst removal is effective in more than 95% of infants. &#173;Because approximately 20%–30% of patients have bilateral nasal cysts, sometimes without vis&#173;i&#173;ble dacryocystoceles, bilateral endoscopy is appropriate. Systemic antibiotics should be used perioperatively if acute dacryocystitis is pres&#173;ent. Surgical treatment of an infected dacryocystocele via a skin incision should be avoided &#173;because of the risk of creating a per&#173;sis&#173;tent fistulous tract.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1">Congenital Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction</p>
			<div id="Chapt19_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO) (dacryostenosis) is the most common lacrimal system disorder encountered in pediatric ophthalmology, occurring in approximately 5% of infants, and is more common in patients with Down syndrome (22%) and in &#173;those with midfacial abnormalities.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CNLDO can be classified as &#173;simple or complex. &#173;Simple CNLDO is caused by a thin mucosal membrane at the distal end of the NLD, at the valve of Hasner (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 19-4</span>). Complex CNLDO is due to diffuse obstruction or bony obstruction, as is frequently found in patients with midfacial abnormalities.</p>
			<p class="h2">Clinical Features and Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Infants with CNLDO usually pres&#173;ent within the first month of life with epiphora, recurrent periocular crusting, or both (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 19-5</span>). They do not have photophobia or blepharospasm. Symptoms are usually chronic and worse with nasal congestion; bilateral involvement is common. Applying digital pressure to the lacrimal sac usually results in retrograde discharge of mucoid or mucopurulent material.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Excessive tearing due to CNLDO must be differentiated from epiphora due to infantile glaucoma, which has additional features, including photophobia, blepharospasm, ocular hypertension, corneal clouding with or without enlargement, and breaks in Descemet membrane (see Chapter&#160;22). Besides infantile glaucoma, the differential diagnosis of CNLDO includes conjunctivitis, and epiblepharon with irritation due to trichiasis. A thorough examination is necessary to rule out other ocular abnormalities. A cycloplegic refraction should be performed as results of some studies suggest that &#173;there is an increased rate of anisometropia and amblyopia in patients with CNLDO.</p>
			<p class="h2">Nonsurgical Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There is a high rate of spontaneous resolution of CNLDO, with approximately 90% of patients improving within the first 9–12 months of life. For this reason, conservative treatment is recommended initially for &#173;these patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Conservative treatment includes lacrimal sac massage and use of topical antibiotics. Massage serves 2 purposes: it empties the sac, thereby reducing the opportunity for bacterial growth, and it applies hydrostatic pressure to the obstruction, which may open the duct and resolve the condition. Massage is performed by applying pressure to the lacrimal sac, at the medial canthus, a few times per day. This is the only location where application of external pressure on the lacrimal sac can be effective. Passing the fin&#173;ger along the nares, which is often recommended by primary care providers, is not effective &#173;because the NLD is covered by bone at this site.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Topical antibiotics are often recommended if patients have significant periocular discharge. &#173;There are 3 impor&#173;tant points with regard to topical antibiotic use in this disorder. First, the antibiotics do not cure the obstruction but may reduce the amount of mucopurulent discharge. Second, the infection in CNLDO is due to stasis of fluid within the lacrimal sac; therefore, almost any bacteria, including normal flora, may cause infection. Most broad-&#173;spectrum antibiotics are effective in reducing the associated symptoms, so culturing the mucoid or mucopurulent material is usually not necessary. Third, antibiotic use for a few days often produces improvement, and prolonged use may not be necessary. Parents may be instructed to administer the antibiotics as needed when the amount of discharge increases.</p>
			<p class="h2">Surgical Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Nasolacrimal probing is one of the most common procedures performed by pediatric ophthalmologists and is very effective in treating CNLDO. It is used to treat infants with CNLDO whose symptoms do not resolve over time with conservative treatment. &#173;There are 2 common approaches to the surgical management of this disorder. Some ophthalmologists recommend in-&#173;office probing of young infants, whereas &#173;others prefer to delay treatment and perform surgery in the operating room on older infants. The advantages of early in-&#173;office probing are that it avoids general anesthesia, resolves symptoms earlier, and is likely more cost effective. The disadvantages are that a painful procedure is performed on an awake infant and that surgery is performed on many infants who would have spontaneously improved without surgery. The advantages of &#173;later surgery in the operating room are that fewer infants require treatment and the procedure is performed in a more controlled environment in which additional procedures can be performed concurrently. &#173;Either of &#173;these approaches is acceptable.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Surgical procedures for CNLDO are also discussed in BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System.</span></p>
			<p class="reference--journal--single">Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group. A randomized trial comparing the cost-&#173;effectiveness of 2 approaches for treating unilateral nasolacrimal duct obstruction. <br /><span class="italic">Arch Ophthalmol.</span> 2012;130(12):1525–1533.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Probing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When nasolacrimal probing is to be performed in the operating room, placement of an oxymetazoline-&#173;soaked pledget beneath the inferior turbinate before surgery may decrease intraoperative bleeding. The initial step in nasolacrimal probing is dilation of the puncta and proximal canaliculi. Punctal membranes and atretic canaliculi are sometimes not recognized &#173;until surgery. Their management is discussed earlier in this chapter. &#173;Because the lacrimal system cannot be visualized beyond the puncta, knowledge of the anatomy and normal course of the lacrimal excretory system is essential for passing lacrimal probes properly. The probes are initially inserted in the puncta, perpendicular to the eyelid. Within 1–2&#160;mm of the eyelid margin, the canaliculi turn approximately 90°; the probes are therefore turned almost immediately and passed along the course of the canaliculi &#173;until the nasal bone is encountered on the medial side of the lacrimal sac. The probes are held flat on the patient’s face and rotated and passed &#173;gently into the distal duct (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 19-6A</span>). With &#173;simple CNLDO, most surgeons feel a slight popping sensation as the probe passes through the membrane causing the obstruction. With complex CNLDO (see the following section), the surgeon’s probe may encounter a firmer obstruction or a tight passage throughout the length of the NLD.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A wide variety of techniques are used for probing in NLDO. Most surgeons begin with a size 0 or 1 Bowman probe, and some pass successively larger probes to enlarge the distal duct. Introducing a second metal probe into the nares and making direct contact with the previously placed lacrimal probe verifies the position of the latter (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 19-6B</span>). Alternatively, direct inspection with a nasal speculum and headlamp or with a nasal endoscope can precisely determine the position of the probe. Irrigation may be performed following probing in order to verify that the system is patent. Infracture of the inferior turbinate may be used to widen the area where the fluid drains beneath the inferior turbinate. The surgeon accomplishes this by placing a small periosteal elevator beneath the turbinate or by grasping it with a hemostat and then rotating the instrument.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Postoperatively, minor bleeding from the nose or into the tears commonly occurs and usually requires no treatment. Optional postoperative medi&#173;cations include antibiotic drops, corticosteroid drops, or both instilled 1–4 times daily for 1–2 weeks. Phenylephrine or oxymetazoline nasal spray may be used to control nasal bleeding or congestion. &#173;Because transient bacteremia can occur &#173;after probing, systemic antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered for patients with cardiac disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Resolution of signs &#173;after probing may not occur &#173;until 1 week or more postoperatively. Recurrence &#173;after unsuccessful probing is usually evident within 1–2 months. The success rate of properly performed initial probing for CNLDO exceeds 80% in infants younger than 15 months.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Significant complications of probing are rare. In some patients, mild epiphora occurs occasionally, particularly outdoors in cold weather or in conjunction with an upper respiratory tract infection. This epiphora is prob&#173;ably attributable to a patent but narrow lacrimal drainage channel. Usually no additional treatment is required.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-2">Patients with complex CNLDO or per&#173;sis&#173;tent symptoms &#173;after initial probing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A variety of treatment options are available for patients with complex CNLDO (usually discovered at the time of initial surgery) or &#173;those with symptoms that persist following initial probing. Some surgeons may choose to perform balloon dacryoplasty or NLD stenting as the initial procedure in patients they believe are at risk for recurrence of CNLDO. Recurrent NLDO is more likely in persons with chronic rhinitis, &#173;those older than 36 months, or patients with complex CNLDO. Balloon dacryoplasty or intubation is more successful than probing alone for per&#173;sis&#173;tent NLDO &#173;after initial probing. The se&#173;lection of intubation or balloon dacryoplasty is based on surgeon preference. Infracture of the inferior turbinate has not been shown to improve surgical outcomes. Perioperative systemic antibiotics and ste&#173;roids may be beneficial in &#173;children at risk for recurrence.</p>

			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Balloon dacryoplasty</span> Balloon dacryoplasty (balloon catheter dilation) is performed by passing a catheter into the distal NLD and inflating its balloon at the site of obstruction (<span class="xref-figure">Fig </span><span class="xref-figure">19-7</span>). This procedure is particularly useful for patients with diffuse, rather than localized, obstruction of the distal duct.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Intubation</span> Intubation of the lacrimal system is usually recommended when probing or balloon dacryoplasty has failed. Several methods of intubation are available. Bicanalicular intubation is performed by passing stents through the upper and lower canaliculi and recovering them in the nares. Most surgeons secure the stents in the nares by using a bolster or by suturing the stents to the nasal mucosa. Monocanalicular stents are placed by passing them through &#173;either the upper or lower canaliculus or sometimes by passing separate stents through both canaliculi.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Complications associated with stents include elongation of the lacrimal puncta, dislodging and protrusion of the stents, and corneal abrasions. In some cases, the stent can be repositioned, but early removal may be necessary.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Stents are usually left in place for 2–6 months, but shorter periods can be successful. The technique used for stent removal depends on the age of the patient, the mea&#173;sure employed to secure the stent, and the position of the stent (in place or partially dislodged).</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Nasal endoscopy</span> Anatomical abnormalities of the distal NLD account for some of the failures of initial probing. &#173;These abnormalities include cysts similar to &#173;those seen in infants with dacryocystoceles and flaccid mucosal membranes obstructing the distal duct. In addition, &#173;there may be false passages, which may be recognized endoscopically; in &#173;these cases, probing may be repeated. Removal of abnormal structures is performed &#173;under endoscopic guidance. Endoscopy may be performed by the ophthalmologist alone or in conjunction with an otolaryngologist.</p>
			<p class="h3">Older &#173;children with NLDO</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There is some controversy in the lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture regarding success rates for NLD surgery in older &#173;children. The Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group (PEDIG) found a high success rate for &#173;simple probing in &#173;children up to 36 months of age. Many older &#173;children have &#173;simple NLDO; they have the same membranous obstruction of the distal duct found in younger &#173;children with NLDO (see <span class="xref-figure">Fig 19-4A</span>). As previously mentioned, this obstruction is identified by a distinct popping sensation as the probe is passed into the distal duct. Probing in older patients with this finding has a success rate similar to that in younger &#173;children. &#173;Because probing is less likely to be successful in complex NLDO, particularly in older &#173;children, balloon dacryoplasty or stent placement should be considered as the initial surgical procedure.</p>

Primary treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction with probing in &#173;children younger than 4&#160;years. <span class="italic">Ophthalmology.</span> 2008;115(3):577–584.</p>
			<p class="h3">Dacryocystorhinostomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Dacryocystorhinostomy involves creation of a new opening between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity. It is an option when the procedures described in the preceding sections are unsuccessful and NLDO persists or recurs. The decision of when to perform this procedure is affected by the severity of the signs and symptoms of obstruction. See BCSC Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System,</span> for further discussion of this procedure.</p>
