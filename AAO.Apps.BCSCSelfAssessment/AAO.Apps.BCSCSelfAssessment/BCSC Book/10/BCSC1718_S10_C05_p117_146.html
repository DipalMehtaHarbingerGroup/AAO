			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Introduction</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Angle closure refers to an anatomical configuration in which there is mechanical blockage of the trabecular meshwork by the peripheral iris. Anatomical alterations in anterior segment structures obstruct the iridocorneal drainage angle through apposition or consequent to the formation of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). Traditionally, angle closure is divided into 2&#160;main categories: primary and secondary angle closure. BCSC Section&#160;10 uses these traditional categories but also incorporates the definitions of primary angle closure presented in the European Glaucoma Society classification to reflect trends in the ophthalmologic literature. The European Glaucoma Society has classified primary angle closure as follows, based on the natural course of the disease: <span class="italic">primary angle-&#173;closure suspect (PACS),</span> in which the eye has an increased anatomical risk of angle closure; <span class="italic">primary angle closure (PAC),</span> in which trabecular meshwork damage or dysfunction is characterized by PAS or elevated intraocular pressure (IOP); and <span class="italic">primary angle-&#173;closure glaucoma (PACG),</span> which is characterized by PAS or elevated IOP and glaucomatous optic neuropathy (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;5-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">The worldwide prevalence of angle-&#173;closure glaucoma (ACG) is estimated to be 16&#160;million. ACG is more common in females and in certain ethnic groups, such as particular Asian populations and the Inuit. Prevalence rates in European and African populations are generally lower; however, genetic heterogeneity can result in widely varying rates within populations of the same continent. ACG has been estimated to account for over 90% of blindness due to glaucoma in the Chinese population.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The angle-&#173;closure-related disorders are a diverse group of diseases. While the various forms of angle closure are unified by the presence of PAS and/or iridotrabecular apposition, the mechanism of synechiae formation or iris apposition varies. Moreover, the clinical presentation of angle closure varies from the abrupt and dramatic onset of acute angle closure to the insidious and asymptomatic presentation of chronic disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In either presentation, acute or chronic, the physician must identify the anatomical changes within the angle and the underlying pathophysiology that has precipitated <br />these changes in order to initiate the appropriate therapy. Early diagnosis and treatment of most forms of angle closure or narrowing can be invaluable, and sometimes curative. Accordingly, understanding the pathophysiology is essential if proper treatment is to be initiated. Also, screening patients at greatest risk for angle closure can be beneficial in reducing the number of patients who develop these diseases and in reducing the risk of blindness.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Primary and secondary angle closure are subdivided by the symptomatology, etiology, and duration of each of the diseases. In <span class="italic">primary</span> angle closure, there is no identifiable secondary pathologic condition; there is only an anatomical predisposition. In <span class="italic">secondary</span> angle closure, an identifiable pathologic cause, such as an intumescent lens, iris neovascularization, chronic inflammation, corneal endothelial migration, or epithelial ingrowth, initiates the angle closure.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Pathogenesis and Pathophysiology of Angle Closure</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The hallmark of angle closure is the apposition or adhesion of the peripheral iris to the trabecular meshwork. The portion of the anterior chamber angle affected by such apposition is “closed,” and drainage of aqueous humor through the angle is reduced as a result. Such closure may be transient and intermittent (appositional) or permanent (synechial). These 2&#160;forms of angle closure can be distinguished using indentation gonioscopy. The IOP becomes elevated as a result of the reduced aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Conceptually, the mechanisms of angle closure fall into 2&#160;categories (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;5-2</span>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-4">mechanisms that push the iris forward from behind</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-5">mechanisms that pull the iris forward into contact with the trabecular meshwork</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In addition to these traditional descriptions of angle closure, more recent work has suggested that the dynamic changes in iris volume and water content normally occurring in the human eye are dysfunctional in patients with ACG and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of angle closure. Indeed, there is mounting evidence that dynamic features of the eye rather than its static anatomy contribute to ACG.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Pupillary Block</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pupillary block is the most frequent cause of angle closure. The pathophysiology of PAC is complex and not completely understood, but pupillary block is the underlying cause of most cases of this disease. The flow of aqueous from the posterior chamber through the pupil is impeded at the level of the lens–iris interface, and this obstruction creates a pressure gradient between the posterior and anterior chambers, causing the peripheral iris to bow forward against the trabecular meshwork (Chapter&#160;1, Fig&#160;1-1). Pupillary block is maximal when the pupil is in the mid-&#173;dilated position. In most cases of PACG, pupillary block results from anatomical factors at the lens–iris interface. Though rare, <span class="italic">absolute pupillary block</span> occurs when there is no movement of aqueous through the pupil as a result of 360° of posterior synechiae (secluded pupil). These posterior synechiae can form between the iris and the lens or, in an aphakic eye, between the iris and capsular remnants and/or the vitreous face. Pupillary block occurs when there is restricted movement of aqueous through the pupil because of iris contact with the lens, intraocular lens, capsular remnants, anterior hyaloid, or vitreous space–occupying substance (air, silicone oil). Pupillary block may be broken by an unobstructed peripheral iridectomy or iridotomy.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lens-Induced Pupillary Block Angle-&#173;Closure Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intumescent or dislocated lenses (complete zonular dehiscence) may increase pupillary block and cause angle closure. Angle closure from an unusually large or intumescent lens is often referred to as <span class="italic">phacomorphic glaucoma</span> (see the subsection “Phacomorphic glaucoma” later in this chapter). With lens subluxation (partial zonular dehiscence), as in Marfan syndrome, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or homocystinuria, pupillary block from the lens or vitreous may occur. Lens block describes an underlying mechanism of PAC, in which the lens’s increased anterior-&#173;posterior excursion is due to weakened or lax zonular fibers. This zonular laxity allows the lens to move forward, increasing the relative resistance to aqueous flow through the pupil, which can increase pupillary block, inciting angle closure. The prone position may increase the tendency of the lens to move forward.</p>
			<p class="h2">Angle Closure Without Pupillary Block</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Angle closure may occur without pupillary block. Iridotrabecular apposition or synechiae formation can result from the iris and/or lens being pushed, rotated, or pulled forward for a variety of reasons, as outlined in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;5-2</span>. Each of these underlying mechanisms can usually be identified by a comprehensive examination, including gonioscopy. Many patients present with multiple underlying causes for their angle closure.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Iris-Induced Angle Closure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In iris-&#173;induced angle closure, the peripheral iris is the cause of the iridotrabecular apposition. Iris-&#173;induced angle closure can occur directly with developmental anomalies such as anterior cleavage abnormalities, in which the iris insertion into the scleral spur or meshwork is more anterior; a thick peripheral iris, which on dilatation “rolls” into the trabecular meshwork; and/or anteriorly displaced ciliary processes, which may secondarily rotate the peripheral iris forward (plateau iris) into the meshwork. Iris-&#173;induced angle closure also occurs in aniridia: the rudimentary iris leaflets present in aniridia rotate into the angle, resulting in secondary angle closure.</p>

			<p class="h2-h1">Risk Factors for Developing Primary Angle Closure</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Race</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The prevalence of PACG in patients older than 40&#160;years varies greatly depending on race and ethnicity; for example, it is 0.1%–0.2% in blacks, 0.1%–0.6% in whites, 0.3% in the Japanese, 0.4%–1.4% in other East Asians, 2.1%–5.0% in the Inuit, and 2.3% in a mixed ethnic group in South Africa. Some of this variation in prevalence—for example, between whites and the Inuit—can be explained by differences in the biometric parameters (anterior chamber depth, axial length) of these groups; however, the increased prevalence of PACG in the Chinese and in other East Asian populations cannot be explained by biometric parameters alone. It has become increasingly clear that the burden of PACG is greater in Asian countries.</p>

			<p class="h3">Ocular biometrics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Eyes that develop PAC tend to have small, “crowded” anterior segments and short axial lengths (ALs). The most important factors predisposing an eye to angle closure are a shallow anterior chamber, a thick lens, increased anterior curvature of the lens, a short AL, and a small corneal diameter and radius of curvature. An anterior chamber depth (ACD) of less than 2.5&#160;mm predisposes patients to PAC; in fact, in most patients with PAC, the ACD is less than 2.1&#160;mm. Improvements in ocular biometry techniques have allowed researchers to demonstrate a clear association between ACD and PAS. While primary PAS seem to be uncommon in eyes whose ACD is greater than 2.4&#160;mm, there is a strong correlation of increasing PAS formation with an ACD of less than 2.4&#160;mm. However, angle closure still occurs in eyes with deep anterior chambers in some cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The prevalence of PAC increases with each decade after 40&#160;years of age. This has been explained by the increasing thickness and forward movement of the lens with age and the resultant increase in iridolenticular contact. PAC is rare in persons younger than 40&#160;years, and the etiology of angle closure in young individuals is most often related to structural or developmental anomalies rather than pupillary block.</p>

			<p class="h3">Sex</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Primary angle closure is 2 to 4&#160;times more common in women than in men, irrespective of race. Studies assessing ocular biometry data have found that women tend to have smaller anterior segments and shorter ALs than men. These differences do not appear to be large enough to explain the gender predilection, however.</p>
			<p class="h3">Family history</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The incidence of PAC is increased in first-&#173;degree relatives of affected individuals. In whites, the prevalence of PAC in first-&#173;degree relatives has been reported to be between 1% and 12%, whereas results from a survey in a Chinese population showed that the risk was 6&#160;times higher in patients with any family history. In the Inuit, the relative risk in patients with a positive family history is increased 3.5&#160;times compared with the general Inuit population. These familial associations support a genetic influence in PAC. A recent genomewide association study reported the association of an <span class="italic">ABCC5</span> gene variant with reduced ACD and increased risk of PACG. A further study identified 3&#160;loci associated with PACG.</p>

			<p class="h3">Refractive error</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Primary angle closure occurs most commonly, but not exclusively, in patients with hyperopia, irrespective of race. Increasing rates of myopia, especially in Asia, have influenced the prevalence of this disease. Nonetheless, angle closure does occur in patients with significant myopia, underscoring the need to perform gonioscopy in all patients. Angle closure in a patient with high myopia should prompt the clinician to search for secondary mechanisms such as microspherophakia, plateau iris configuration, or phacomorphic closure related to nuclear sclerotic cataract.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Primary Angle-&#173;Closure Suspect</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An eye termed <span class="italic">primary angle-&#173;closure suspect (PACS)</span> has an occludable, or narrow, anterior chamber angle but no overt signs of PAC (IOP elevation or PAS) or glaucomatous optic nerve damage. Thus, a narrow angle is not synonymous with a diagnosis of glaucoma, and the term is an anatomical description only. PACS eyes with shorter axial lengths are also at risk for PAC.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Only a small percentage of eyes with shallow anterior chambers develop PAC. Unfortunately, the predictive value of gonioscopy is relatively poor in determining which susceptible eyes will develop overt angle closure, even when gonioscopy is performed by experienced clinicians. Provocative tests such as pharmacologic pupillary dilation and the darkroom prone-&#173;position test have been used to precipitate a limited form of angle closure and thus predict which patients might develop angle closure. However, provocative testing has not been validated in a prospective study and is rarely used.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The decision to treat an asymptomatic patient with narrow angles rests on an accurate assessment of the anterior chamber angle and the clinical judgment of the ophthalmologist. Any patient with narrow angles should be advised of the symptoms of angle closure, the need for immediate ophthalmologic attention if symptoms occur, and the value of long-term periodic follow-&#173;up. An iridotomy is not necessary in all patients with a borderline narrow angle. A laser iridotomy should be considered in patients who have a narrow angle with documented appositional (ie, transient and intermittent) closure, PAS, increased segmental trabecular meshwork pigmentation, a history of previous angle closure, or other risk factors for angle closure (ACD &lt;2.0&#160;mm, strong family history). The status of the lens and the benefit of cataract surgery should also be considered in the decision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A variety of factors that cause pupillary dilation—various drugs, pain, emotional upset, and fright, among others—may induce angle closure. In predisposed eyes with shallow anterior chambers, either mydriatic or miotic agents can precipitate acute angle closure (see the following subsection). Mydriatic agents include not only dilating drops but also systemic medications with sympathomimetic or anticholinergic activity that may cause pupillary dilation. The effect of miotics is to pull the peripheral iris away from the anterior chamber angle. However, strong miotics may also cause the zonular fibers of the lens to relax, allowing the lens–iris interface to move forward. Furthermore, their use results in greater iris–lens contact, thus potentially increasing pupillary block. For these reasons, miotics, especially the cholinesterase inhibitors, may induce or worsen angle closure. Gonioscopy should be repeated soon after miotic drugs are administered to patients with narrow angles.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because of their potential for precipitating angle closure in susceptible individuals, a number of systemic medications that possess adrenergic (sympathomimetic) or anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) activity carry warnings against use by patients with glaucoma; these include allergy and cold medications, antidepressants, and some urological drugs. Although systemic administration generally does not raise intraocular drug levels to the same degree as topical administration, even slight mydriasis in a patient with a critically narrow angle can induce angle closure. When such drugs are administered to patients with potentially occludable angles, the ophthalmologist should inform the patient of the risk and consider performing iridotomy.</p>

			<p class="h2">Acute Primary Angle Closure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In acute primary angle closure (PAC), IOP rises rapidly as a result of relatively sudden blockage of the trabecular meshwork by the iris. Acute PAC is typically manifested by ocular pain, headache, blurred vision, and rainbow-&#173;colored halos around lights. Acute systemic distress may result in nausea and vomiting. The rise in IOP to relatively high levels causes corneal epithelial edema, which is responsible for the visual symptoms. Signs of acute angle closure include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-4">high IOP</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">mid-dilated, sluggish, and irregularly shaped pupil</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">corneal epithelial edema</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">congested episcleral and conjunctival blood vessels</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">shallow peripheral anterior chamber</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-5">mild amount of aqueous flare and cells</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Definitive diagnosis depends on the gonioscopic verification of angle closure. Gonioscopy should be possible in almost all cases of acute angle closure, although clearing of corneal edema with topical IOP-&#173;lowering therapy, topical glycerin, or paracentesis may be necessary to enable visualization of the angle. Dynamic gonioscopy, with indentation of the central cornea, may help the clinician determine whether the iris–trabecular meshwork blockage is reversible (appositional closure) or irreversible (synechial closure), and it may also be therapeutic in breaking the attack of acute angle closure. Gonioscopy of the fellow eye in a patient with PAC usually reveals a narrow, occludable angle. The presence of a deep angle in the fellow eye should prompt the clinician to search for secondary causes of elevated IOP, such as a posterior segment mass, zonular insufficiency, or the iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome. When performing gonioscopy, the clinician should observe the effect that the examination light has on the angle recess. For example, the pupillary constriction stimulated by the slit-lamp beam itself may open the angle and the narrow recess may go unrecognized (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">During an acute attack, the IOP may be high enough to cause glaucomatous optic nerve damage, ischemic nerve damage, and/or retinal vascular occlusion. PAS can form rapidly, and IOP-&#173;induced ischemia may produce sector atrophy of the iris, releasing pigment. This causes pigmentary dusting of the iris surface and corneal endothelium. Iris ischemia, specifically of the iris sphincter muscle, may cause the pupil to become permanently fixed and dilated. <span class="italic">Glaukomflecken,</span> characteristic small anterior subcapsular lens opacities, may also develop as a result of necrosis. These findings are helpful in the detection of previous episodes of acute PAC.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The definitive treatment of acute angle closure associated with pupillary block is usually laser iridotomy (discussed later), but mild attacks may be broken by cholinergic agents (pilocarpine 1%–2%), which induce miosis that pulls the peripheral iris away from the trabecular meshwork. However, these agents may worsen some types of angle closure without pupillary block. Stronger miotics should be avoided, as they may increase the vascular congestion of the iris or rotate the lens–iris interface more anteriorly, increasing the pupillary block. Moreover, when the IOP is markedly elevated (eg, &gt;40–50&#160;mm&#160;Hg), the pupillary sphincter may be ischemic and unresponsive to miotic agents alone. In this case, the patient should be treated with other topical agents, including <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists, <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonists, or prostaglandin analogues; or with topical, oral, or intravenous carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. A hyperosmotic agent may be administered orally or intravenously or a paracentesis can be performed with a 30-gauge needle or sharp blade. Globe compression over the central cornea, dynamic gonioscopy, and careful paracentesis with a sharp blade are all techniques to acutely lower the IOP in order to clear the corneal edema and allow laser iridotomy. Care should be taken, as the lens or iris can be easily injured when these techniques are employed. Argon laser peripheral iridoplasty may also help relieve acute attacks. Nonselective adrenergic agonists or medications with significant <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>-adrenergic activity (apraclonidine) should be avoided to prevent further pupillary dilation and iris ischemia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In most cases of PAC, the fellow eye shares the anatomical predisposition for increased pupillary block and is at high risk of developing acute angle closure, especially if the inciting mechanism included a systemic sympathomimetic agent such as a nasal decongestant or an anticholinergic agent. In addition, the pain and emotional upset resulting from the involvement of the first eye may increase sympathetic flow to the fellow eye, resulting in pupillary dilation. It is recommended that a peripheral iridotomy be performed in the fellow eye if a similar angle configuration is present.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Laser iridotomy is the treatment of choice for acute PAC due to pupillary block. Much less commonly, a surgical iridectomy is used; these procedures are discussed in Chapter&#160;8. Lensectomy is also a viable treatment option, although laser iridotomy may be more easily accomplished in the acute setting, especially if the eye is inflamed. Once an iridotomy has been performed, the pupillary block is relieved and the pressure gradient between the posterior and anterior chambers is normalized, which in most cases allows the iris to fall away from the trabecular meshwork. As a result, the anterior chamber deepens and the angle opens. If a laser iridotomy cannot be performed, the acute attack may be broken by flattening the peripheral iris with laser iridoplasty, relieving the pupillary block with laser pupilloplasty, or performing an iridectomy or lensectomy with goniosynechialysis. In such cases, a peripheral iridotomy/iridectomy should be performed, if not already done, once the attack is broken and the cornea is of adequate clarity. Following resolution of the acute attack, it is important to reevaluate the angle by gonioscopy to assess the degree of residual synechial angle closure and to confirm the reopening of at least part of the angle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Improved IOP does not necessarily mean that the angle has opened. Because of ciliary body ischemia and reduced aqueous production, the IOP may remain low for weeks following acute angle closure. Thus, IOP may be a poor indicator of angle function or anatomy. A second gonioscopy or serial gonioscopy is therefore essential for follow-&#173;up of the patient to be certain that the angle has adequately opened.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Subacute or Intermittent Angle Closure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Subacute or intermittent angle closure is a condition characterized by episodes of blurred vision, halos, and mild pain caused by elevated IOP. Vague symptoms of pain or headache not associated with visual symptoms have a low specificity for angle closure. The visual symptoms resolve spontaneously, especially during sleep-&#173;induced miosis, and the IOP is usually normal between episodes, which occur periodically over&#160;days,&#160;months, or years. These episodes are often confused with headaches or migraines, so a careful history is required. The correct diagnosis can be made only with a high index of suspicion and gonioscopy. The typical history and the gonioscopic appearance of a narrow angle with or without PAS help establish the diagnosis. Such episodes may occur in the absence of symptoms as well, and are identified by elevated IOP or the presence of PAS in the setting of a narrow angle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Laser iridotomy is the treatment of choice in subacute angle closure unless significant lens opacity is present, in which case lensectomy is typically curative. This condition can progress to chronic angle closure or to an acute attack that does not resolve spontaneously. With improvements in phacoemulsification, especially in terms of anterior chamber stabilization and fluidic control, primary lensectomy is increasingly recognized as an effective treatment for this disorder. In cases of significant synechial closure, goniosynechialysis may be performed in conjunction with lensectomy to help open the angle and improve trabecular outflow. Such treatment is more definitive than iridotomy but also introduces the additional risks inherent in intraocular surgery.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Chronic Angle Closure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chronic angle closure may develop after acute angle closure in which synechial closure persists. It may also develop when the angle closes gradually and IOP rises slowly as angle function progressively becomes compromised. The latter form of chronic angle closure, in which there is gradual asymptomatic angle closure, is the most common presentation of angle closure. Because of the asymptomatic nature of this condition, vision loss may be the presenting concern. Accordingly, this disease tends to be diagnosed in its later stages. It is a major cause of blindness in Asia. Chronic PAC is often referred to as <span class="italic">creeping angle closure</span> because of the slow formation of PAS, which advance circumferentially. The cause of the phenomenon is uncertain, but evidence suggests that multiple mechanisms are involved, including pupillary block, abnormalities in iris thickness and position, and plateau iris configuration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In chronic PAC, permanent PAS are present, as determined by indentation gonioscopy. The clinical course resembles that of open-&#173;angle glaucoma in its lack of symptoms, initial modest elevation of IOP, progressive glaucomatous optic nerve damage, and characteristic visual field loss. Over time, however, IOP can rise precipitously and become more difficult to control. The diagnosis of chronic PAC is frequently overlooked, and this condition is commonly confused with chronic open-&#173;angle glaucoma. As previously mentioned, gonioscopic examination of all glaucoma patients is important for accurate diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Even if miotics and other agents lower the IOP, an iridotomy is necessary to relieve the pupillary block component and reduce the potential for further synechial angle closure. Without an iridotomy, closure of the angle usually progresses and makes the subsequent glaucoma more difficult to control. Even with a patent peripheral iridotomy, progressive angle closure can occur, and repeated periodic gonioscopy is imperative. An iridotomy with or without long-term use of ocular hypotensive medication controls the disease in most patients with chronic PAC. Others may require iridoplasty or lensectomy with or without goniosynechialysis. If these measures fail to lower the IOP, subsequent filtering surgery may be necessary.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-13">Plateau Iris Syndrome</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Plateau iris refers to an atypical configuration of the anterior chamber angle that may result in acute or chronic PAC. Angle closure in plateau iris is most often caused by anteriorly positioned ciliary processes that critically narrow the anterior chamber recess by pushing the peripheral iris forward. Evidence suggests that plateau iris configuration may result from a more anterior junction of the iris dilator muscle and the ciliary epithelium, which causes the iris root to be more articulated. A component of pupillary block is often present. The angle may be further compromised following dilation of the pupil as the peripheral iris bunches up and obstructs the trabecular meshwork. Plateau iris may be suspected if the central anterior chamber appears to be of normal depth and the iris plane appears flat for an eye with angle closure. This suspicion can be confirmed by the presence of the “double-&#173;hump” sign on gonioscopy or ultrasound biomicroscopy (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-2</span>). The condition will be missed if the examiner relies solely on the slit-lamp examination or <br />the Van Herick method of angle examination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The initial management of plateau iris includes either laser iridotomy to remove any component of pupillary block or lensectomy if cataract is present. Eyes with plateau iris syndrome remain predisposed to angle closure despite a patent iridotomy, as a result of the peripheral iris anatomy. Thus, careful assessment of the angle following iridotomy or lensectomy is necessary to determine whether additional treatment to further deepen the angle is required. PAS formation has been reported to begin at the Schwalbe line <br />and then to extend in a posterior direction over the trabecular meshwork, scleral spur, and angle recess. The reverse is seen in pupillary block–induced angle closure, in which PAS form in the posterior to anterior direction. Patients with plateau iris syndrome may be treated with long-term miotic therapy. However, argon laser peripheral iridoplasty may be more useful in individuals with this condition to flatten and thin the peripheral iris (see Fig&#160;5-2). Repeated gonioscopy at regular intervals is necessary because of the risk of chronic angle closure despite measures to deepen the angle recess.</p>

			<div id="Chapt5_Top5">
			<p class="h2-h1">Lens-Induced Angle Closure</p>
			<p class="h3-h2 ParaOverride-10">Phacomorphic glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The mechanism of phacomorphic glaucoma is typically multifactorial. However, by definition, a significant component of the pathologic angle narrowing is related to the acquired mass effect of the cataractous lens itself. As with PAC, pupillary block often plays an important role in this condition. Phacomorphic narrowing of the angle generally occurs slowly with formation of the cataract. However, in some cases, the onset may be acute and rapid, precipitated by marked lens swelling (intumescence) as a result of cataract formation and the development of pupillary block in an eye that is otherwise not anatomically predisposed to closure (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;5-3, 5-4</span>). Distinguishing between PAC and phacomorphic angle closure is not always straightforward and may not be necessary, as the treatment of both conditions is similar. However, the ACD, gonioscopic appearance, and degree of cataract differ between eyes with PAC and those with phacomorphic angle closure, and these differences can help the clinician determine the etiology. (See also BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract.</span>) A laser iridotomy followed by cataract extraction in a quiet eye is the preferred treatment. In many cases, the iridotomy is unnecessary, as cataract surgery is the definitive treatment in eyes that have the potential for improved vision. Cholinergic agents have a minimal role in the treatment of this condition because they may further narrow the angle and worsen the vision in the presence of cataract. Further, the miotic pupil makes subsequent cataract surgery more <br />challenging.</p>
			<p class="h3">Ectopia lentis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ectopia lentis is defined as displacement of the lens from its normal anatomical position (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-5</span>). With forward displacement, pupillary block may occur, resulting in iris bombé, shallowing of the anterior chamber angle, and secondary angle closure. The treatment of choice is performance of 2&#160;laser iridotomies 180° apart. This relieves the pupillary block and is a temporizing measure until more definitive lensectomy, if indicated to improve visual function, can be performed. Lens extraction is usually indicated to restore vision and to reduce the risk of recurrent pupillary block and chronic angle closure development. See <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;5-3</span> for a list of conditions that can cause ectopia lentis.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Microspherophakia,</span> a congenital disorder in which the lens has a spherical or globular shape, may cause ectopia lentis and subsequent pupillary block and PAC (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-6</span>). Treatment with cycloplegia may tighten the zonule, flatten the lens, and pull it posteriorly, breaking the pupillary block. Miotics may make the condition worse by increasing the pupillary block and by rotating the ciliary body forward, loosening the zonule and allowing the lens to become more globular. Microspherophakia is often familial and may occur as an isolated condition or as part of either Weill-&#173;Marchesani or Marfan syndrome. The most common form of acquired zonular insufficiency and crystalline lens subluxation occurs in the pseudoexfoliation syndrome (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-7</span>).</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-16">Aphakic or pseudophakic angle-&#173;closure glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pupillary block may occur in <span class="italic">aphakic</span> and <span class="italic">pseudophakic</span> eyes. An intact vitreous face can block the pupil and/or an iridotomy site in aphakic or pseudophakic eyes or in a phakic eye with a dislocated lens. Generally, the anterior chamber shallows and the iris shows considerable bombé configuration. Treatment with mydriatic and cycloplegic agents may restore the aqueous flow through the pupil but may also make performing a laser iridotomy difficult initially. Topical <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists, <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and hyperosmotic agents can be effective in reducing IOP prior to performing an iridotomy. One or more laser iridotomies may be required.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pupillary block may also occur with <span class="italic">anterior chamber intraocular lenses.</span> Pupillary block develops with apposition of the iris, vitreous face, and/or lens optic. The lens haptic or vitreous may obstruct the iridectomy site or the pupil, and the peripheral iris bows forward around the anterior chamber intraocular lens to occlude the angle. The central chamber remains deep relative to the peripheral chamber in this instance, because the lens haptic and optic prevent the central portions of the iris and vitreous face from moving forward. Laser iridotomies, often multiple, are required to relieve the block.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition, pupillary block may occur following posterior capsulotomy when vitreous obstructs the pupil. A condition referred to as <span class="italic">capsular block</span> may also be seen, whereby retained viscoelastic or fluid in the capsular bag pushes a posterior chamber intraocular lens anteriorly, which may narrow the angle.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-17">Secondary Angle Closure Without Pupillary Block</p>
			<div id="Chapt5_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A number of disorders can lead to secondary angle closure without pupillary block. This form of secondary angle closure may occur through 1 of 2&#160;mechanisms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-18">contraction of an inflammatory, hemorrhagic, or vascular membrane, band, or exudate in the angle, leading to PAS formation</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">forward displacement of the lens–iris interface, often accompanied by swelling and anterior rotation of the ciliary body</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="h2">Neovascular Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This common, severe type of secondary angle closure is caused by a variety of disorders characterized by retinal or ocular ischemia or ocular inflammation (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;5-4</span>). The most common causes are diabetic retinopathy, central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), and ocular ischemic syndrome. The disease is characterized by fine arborizing blood vessels on the surface of the iris, pupillary margin, and trabecular meshwork, which are accompanied by a fibrous membrane.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Neovascularization of the anterior segment usually presents in a classic pattern, which starts with fine vascular tufts at the pupillary margin (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-8</span>). As these vessels grow, they extend radially over the iris. Unlike dilated stromal vessels, these vessels are delicate and lacey and do not adhere to the normal anterior segment vasculature. Further, when they involve the angle, they cross the ciliary body face and scleral spur as fine single vessels that then branch as they reach and involve the trabecular meshwork (see Chapter&#160;3, Fig&#160;3-6). Often the trabecular meshwork takes on a reddish coloration. With contraction of the fibrovascular membrane, PAS develop and coalesce, gradually closing the angle (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-9</span>). While the fibrovascular membrane, like ICE syndrome, can cause ectropion uveae, it typically does not grow over healthy corneal endothelium (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;5-10, 5-11</span>). Thus, the PAS end at the Schwalbe line, distinguishing this condition from ICE syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinically, patients often present with an acute or subacute glaucoma associated with reduced vision, ocular pain, conjunctival hyperemia, microcystic corneal edema, and high IOP. While performing gonioscopy in patients with possible neovascularization, the clinician may find it helpful to use a bright slit-lamp beam of light and high magnification in order to best visualize these fine vessels.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In rare instances, anterior segment neovascularization may occur without demonstrable retinal ischemia, as in Fuchs heterochromic uveitis and other types of uveitis, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, or isolated iris melanomas. When an ocular cause cannot be found, carotid artery occlusive disease should be considered. In establishing a correct diagnosis, the clinician should distinguish dilated iris vessels associated with inflammation from newly formed abnormal blood vessels.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because the prognosis for neovascular glaucoma is poor, prevention and early diagnosis are essential. In CRVO, angle neovascularization develops without iris neovascularization in approximately 10% of patients. Thus, gonioscopy is vital for early diagnosis. Since the most common cause of iris neovascularization is ischemic retinopathy, the definitive treatment when the ocular media are clear is panretinal photocoagulation. However, anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-&#173;VEGF) therapy (eg, bevacizumab) can be used to acutely reduce the neovascular stimulus. The resulting decrease in neovascularization after panretinal photocoagulation may lower or normalize the IOP, depending on the extent of synechial closure. Even in the presence of total synechial angle closure, panretinal photocoagulation may improve the success rate of subsequent glaucoma surgery by eliminating the angiogenic stimulus and may decrease the risk of hemorrhage at the time of surgery. More recently, anti-&#173;VEGF agents have been successfully employed to promote regression of the neovascular tissue prior to filtering surgery (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-12</span>) and improve outcome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Medical management of neovascular glaucoma yields variable success and is only a temporizing measure until more definitive incisional or laser surgery is undertaken. Topical <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists, <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, cycloplegics, and corticosteroids may be useful in reducing IOP and decreasing inflammation either as a long-term remedy or prior to filtering surgery. Filtering surgery or tube shunt implantation has a better chance of success once the neovascularization has regressed after panretinal photocoagulation or anti-&#173;VEGF therapy. A variety of tube shunts have also been successfully implanted to control the IOP in neovascular glaucoma and, in many cases, tube shunt implantation is the surgical procedure of choice. If these therapies fail or if the eye has poor visual potential, either endoscopic or transscleral cyclophotocoagulation can be considered as an alternative to filtering surgery or tube shunt implantation. See Chapter&#160;8 for discussion of these procedures.</p>

			<p class="h2">Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome is a group of disorders characterized by abnormal corneal endothelium that causes variable degrees of iris atrophy, secondary angle closure, and corneal edema. BCSC Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea,</span> discusses the corneal aspects of ICE syndrome. Three clinical variants have been described: Chandler syndrome, essential (progressive) iris atrophy, and Cogan-&#173;Reese syndrome (iris nevus). Chandler syndrome is the most common of the clinical variants, accounting for approximately 50% of the cases of ICE syndrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">ICE syndrome is clinically unilateral, presents between 20 and 50&#160;years of age, and occurs more often in women. No consistent association has been found with another ocular or systemic disease, and familial cases are very rare. Patients typically present with elevated IOP, decreased vision due to corneal edema, secondary chronic ACG, or an abnormal iris appearance. In each of the 3&#160;clinical variants, the abnormal corneal endothelium takes on a “beaten bronze” appearance, similar to the cornea guttae seen in Fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy. Microcystic corneal edema may be present without elevated IOP, especially in Chandler syndrome. The unaffected eye may have subclinical irregularities of the corneal endothelium without other manifestations of the disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">High PAS are characteristic of ICE syndrome (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-13</span>), and these often extend anterior to the Schwalbe line. The degree of angle closure does not always correlate to the elevation in IOP, because some angles may be functionally closed by the endothelial membrane without overt formation of synechiae.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Various degrees of iris atrophy and corneal changes distinguish the specific clinical entities. The <span class="italic">essential iris atrophy variant</span> of ICE syndrome is characterized by severe progressive iris atrophy resulting in heterochromia, corectopia, ectropion uveae, iris stromal and pigment epithelial atrophy, and hole formation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-14</span>). In <span class="italic">Chandler syndrome,</span> minimal iris atrophy and corectopia occur, and the corneal and angle findings predominate (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-15</span>). The iris atrophy also tends to be less severe in <span class="italic">Cogan-&#173;Reese syndrome,</span> a condition distinguished by tan pedunculated nodules or diffuse pigmented lesions on the anterior iris surface.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Glaucoma develops in approximately 50% of patients with ICE syndrome and may be more severe in essential iris atrophy and Cogan-&#173;Reese syndrome. In ICE, the corneal endothelium migrates posterior to the Schwalbe line, onto the trabecular meshwork. Electron microscopy has shown the endothelium to vary in thickness, with areas of single and multiple endothelial layers and surrounding collagenous and fibrillar tissue. Unlike with normal corneal endothelium, filopodial processes and cytoplasmic actin filaments are present, supporting the migratory nature of these cells. PAS are formed when this migratory endothelium and its surrounding collagenous, fibrillar tissue contract. A virus has been postulated as the etiology of ICE syndrome after lymphocytes were observed on the corneal endothelium of affected patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of ICE syndrome must always be considered in young to middle-&#173;aged patients who present with unilateral, secondary angle closure. It is particularly important to maintain a high index of suspicion for this condition, because it may mimic primary open-&#173;angle glaucoma when the iris and corneal features are subtle. Specular microscopy can confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating an asymmetric loss of endothelial cells and atypical endothelial cell morphology in the involved eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Therapy is directed toward the corneal edema and secondary glaucoma. Hypertonic saline solutions and medications to reduce the IOP, when elevated, can be effective in controlling the corneal edema. The ACG, when present, can be treated medically with aqueous suppressants and prostaglandin analogues. Miotics are often ineffective. When medical therapy fails, filtering surgery (trabeculectomy or a tube shunt) can be effective. Late failures have been reported with trabeculectomy secondary to endothelialization of the fistula. The fistula can be reopened in some cases with the Nd:YAG laser. Laser trabeculoplasty has no useful role in treating glaucoma related to ICE syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h2">Tumors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Tumors in the posterior segment of the eye or anterior uveal cysts may cause a unilateral secondary angle closure. Primary choroidal melanomas, ocular metastases, and retinoblastoma are the most common tumors to cause secondary angle closure. The mechanism of the angle closure is determined by the size, location, and pathology of the tumor. Choroidal and retinal tumors tend to shift the lens–iris interface forward as the tumors enlarge, causing secondary angle closure. Breakdown of the blood–aqueous barrier and inflammation from tissue necrosis can result in posterior and PAS formation, further exacerbating other underlying mechanisms of angle closure. Anterior segment neovascularization often occurs with retinoblastomas, medulloepitheliomas, and choroidal melanomas, as well as following radiation treatment, resulting in neovascular glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="h2">Inflammation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Secondary angle closure can occur as a result of ocular inflammation. Fibrin and increased aqueous proteins released due to the breakdown of the blood–aqueous barrier may predispose the eye to formation of posterior synechiae (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-16</span>) and PAS. If left untreated, these posterior synechiae can result in a secluded pupil, iris bombé, and secondary angle closure (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-17</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Peripheral iris edema, organization of inflammatory debris in the angle, and bridging of the angle by large keratic precipitates (sarcoidosis) occur with the ocular inflammation and may lead to formation of PAS. These PAS form most frequently in the inferior anterior chamber angle, unlike the PAS in PAC, which typically occur in the superior angle. The PAS are usually not uniform in shape or height, further distinguishing inflammatory disease from PAC (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-18</span>). In rare instances, ischemia secondary to inflammation may cause rubeosis iridis and neovascular glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular inflammation can lead to the shallowing and closure of the anterior chamber angle by uveal effusion, resulting in anterior rotation of the ciliary body. Significant posterior uveitis causing massive exudative retinal detachment or choroidal effusions may lead to ACG through forward displacement of the lens–iris interface. Treatment is primarily directed at the underlying cause of the uveitis. Aqueous suppressants and corticosteroids are the primary agents for reducing elevated IOP and preventing synechial angle closure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Interstitial keratitis may be associated with open-&#173;angle glaucoma or angle closure. The angle closure may be caused by chronic inflammation and PAS formation or by multiple cysts of the iris pigment epithelium.</p>

			<p class="h2">Malignant Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Malignant glaucoma (also called aqueous misdirection or ciliary block glaucoma) is a rare but potentially devastating form of glaucoma that usually presents following ocular surgery in patients with a history of angle closure or PAS. It may also occur spontaneously in eyes with an open angle or following cataract surgery or various laser procedures. The disease presents with uniform flattening of both the central and peripheral anterior chamber (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-19</span>), which is typically markedly asymmetrical to the anterior chamber of the fellow eye. This is in contrast to acute PAC, which presents with iris bombé and a shallow peripheral anterior chamber (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-20</span>). Classically, the condition is thought to result from anterior rotation of the ciliary body and posterior misdirection of the aqueous, in association with a relative block to aqueous movement at the level of the lens equator, vitreous face, and ciliary processes. Some have proposed that PAC and malignant glaucoma may result from the simultaneous presence of several factors, including a small eye, a propensity for choroidal expansion, and reduced vitreous fluid conductivity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinically, the anterior chamber is shallow or flat with anterior displacement of the lens, pseudophakos, or vitreous face. Optically clear “aqueous” zones may be seen in the vitreous, highlighting the underlying pathology. In the early postoperative setting, malignant glaucoma is often difficult to distinguish from choroidal effusion, pupillary block, or suprachoroidal hemorrhage. Often the level of IOP, time frame following surgery, patency of an iridotomy, or presence of a choroidal effusion or suprachoroidal hemorrhage helps the clinician make the appropriate diagnosis. In some cases, the clinical picture is difficult to interpret, and surgical intervention may be required in order to make the diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Medical management includes the triad of intensive cycloplegic therapy; aggressive aqueous suppression with <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists, <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript CharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; and reducing the vitreous with hyperosmotic agents. Miotics can make malignant glaucoma worse and therefore should not be used. In aphakic and pseudophakic eyes, the anterior vitreous can be disrupted with the Nd:YAG laser. Argon laser photocoagulation of the ciliary processes reportedly has been helpful in treating this condition; this procedure may alter the adjacent vitreous face. In approximately half of patients, malignant glaucoma can be controlled with laser iridotomy and medical management; half of patients require surgical intervention alone. The definitive surgical treatment is pars plana vitrectomy with anterior hyaloido-&#173;zonulectomy combined with an anterior chamber deepening procedure. BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> discusses vitrectomy in detail.</p>

			<p class="h2">Nonrhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment and Uveal Effusions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A nonrhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs when subretinal fluid is present in the absence of a retinal break. A suprachoroidal effusion or hemorrhage refers to blood or fluid in the potential space between the choroid and the sclera. Retinoblastoma, Coats disease, metastatic carcinoma, choroidal melanoma, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, choroidal effusion/detachment, infections (eg, HIV), and subretinal neovascularization in age-&#173;related macular degeneration with extensive effusion or hemorrhage can cause nonrhegmatogenous retinal detachments. Suprachoroidal mass effect may result in secondary angle closure related to forward displacement of the lens–iris interface. See BCSC Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous,</span> for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In a <span class="italic">rhegmatogenous retinal detachment,</span> the subretinal fluid can escape through the retinal tear and equalize the hydraulic pressure on both sides of the retina. In a nonrhegmatogenous retinal detachment, by contrast, the subretinal fluid accumulates and becomes a space-&#173;occupying lesion in the vitreous, which may progressively push the retina forward against the lens like a hydraulic press. The fluid or hemorrhage may accumulate rapidly, and as it pushes the retina forward to a retrolenticular position, it can in severe cases flatten the anterior chamber completely. The retina may be dramatically visible behind the lens on slit-lamp examination.</p>
			<p class="h2">Epithelial and Fibrous Ingrowth</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Epithelial and fibrous proliferations are rare surgical complications that can cause severe secondary glaucoma. Epithelial and fibrous ingrowth occurs when epithelium and/or connective tissue invades the anterior chamber through a defect in a wound site. Fortunately, improved surgical and wound closure techniques have greatly reduced the incidence of these entities. A common cause of corneal graft failure, fibrous ingrowth is more prevalent than epithelial ingrowth. Risk factors for development of these entities include prolonged inflammation, wound dehiscence, delayed wound closure, or a Descemet membrane tear. Epithelial ingrowth has also been reported following Descemet-&#173;stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Epithelial ingrowth presents as a grayish, sheetlike growth on the trabecular meshwork, iris, ciliary body, and posterior surface of the cornea. It is often associated with vitreous incarceration, wound gape, ocular inflammation, hypotony secondary to choroidal effusions, and corneal edema (<span class="xref-figure">Figs&#160;5-21, 5-22</span>). The epithelial ingrowth consists of nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium with an avascular subepithelial connective tissue layer.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The argon laser produces characteristic white burns on the epithelial membrane on the iris surface, which help to confirm the diagnosis of epithelial ingrowth and to determine the extent of involvement. If the diagnosis remains in question, a cytologic examination of an aqueous aspirate can be performed. Radical surgery is sometimes necessary to remove the intraocular epithelial membrane and the affected tissues and to repair the fistula, but the prognosis remains poor; thus the decision to intervene is made based on the extent of disease, the visual potential, the status of the fellow eye, and socio-&#173;medical circumstances relevant to the affected individual.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fibrovascular tissue may also proliferate into an eye from a penetrating wound. Unlike epithelial proliferation, fibrous ingrowth progresses slowly and is often self-&#173;limited. Fibrous ingrowth appears as a thick, gray-white, vascular retrocorneal membrane with an irregular border. The ingrowth often involves the angle, resulting in PAS formation with destruction of the trabecular meshwork (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-23</span>) and ectropion uveae. The resultant secondary angle closure is often difficult to control. Medication is the preferred treatment of the secondary glaucomas that present without a pupillary block mechanism, although surgical intervention may be required. See Chapters&#160;7 and&#160;8 for further discussion.</p>
			<p class="h2">Trauma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Following ocular trauma, angle-&#173;closure glaucoma without pupillary block may develop from the formation of PAS associated with angle recession or from contusion, hyphema, and inflammation. See Chapter&#160;4 for discussion of trauma.</p>
			<p class="h2">Retinal Surgery and Retinal Vascular Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Used for surgical repair of retinal detachments, scleral buckles, especially the encircling bands, can produce shallowing of the anterior chamber angle and frank angle closure, often accompanied by choroidal effusion and anterior rotation of the ciliary body, causing a flattening of the peripheral iris with a relatively deep central anterior chamber. Usually, the anterior chamber deepens with opening of the anterior chamber angle over days to&#160;weeks with medical therapy consisting of cycloplegics, anti-&#173;inflammatory agents, &#173;<span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and hyperosmotic agents. If medical management is unsuccessful, argon laser iridoplasty, drainage of suprachoroidal fluid, or adjustment of the scleral buckle may be required. Iridectomy is usually of little benefit in this condition. The scleral buckle can impede venous drainage by compressing a vortex vein, elevating episcleral venous pressure and IOP. Such cases may respond only to moving the scleral buckle or releasing tension on the encircling band.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Following a pars plana vitrectomy, angle closure may result from the injection into the eye of air, long-&#173;acting gases such as sulfur hexafluoride and perfluorocarbons (perfluoropropane and perfluoroethane), or silicone oil. These substances are less dense than water and rise to the top of the eye. An iridotomy may be beneficial and should be located inferiorly to prevent obstruction of the iridotomy site by the gas or oil.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Eyes that have undergone complicated vitreoretinal surgery and have elevated IOP require individualized treatment plans. Treatment options include the following: removal of the silicone oil; release of the encircling element; removal of expansile gases; or primary glaucoma surgery, such as trabeculectomy, tube shunt implantation, or a cyclodestructive procedure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Following panretinal photocoagulation, IOP may become elevated by an angle-&#173;closure mechanism. The ciliary body is thickened and rotated anteriorly, and often an anterior annular choroidal detachment occurs. Generally, this secondary glaucoma is self-&#173;limited, and therapy is directed at temporary medical management with cycloplegic agents, topical corticosteroids, and aqueous suppressants.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CRVO sometimes causes early shallowing of the angle, presumably because of swelling of the choroid and ciliary body. In rare cases, the angle becomes sufficiently compromised, leading to angle closure and elevated IOP. The chamber deepens and the angle closure resolves over 1&#160;week to several&#160;weeks. Medical therapy for the elevated IOP, combined with administration of topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia, is usually preferred. However, if the contralateral eye of a patient with CRVO has a potentially occludable anterior chamber angle, the ophthalmologist must consider an underlying pupillary block mechanism and the possible need for bilateral iridotomy.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Nanophthalmos</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A nanophthalmic eye is normal in shape but unusually small, with a shortened axial length (&lt;20&#160;mm), a small corneal diameter, and a relatively large lens for the volume of the eye. Thickened sclera may impede drainage from the vortex veins. These eyes are markedly hyperopic and highly susceptible to angle closure, which occurs at an earlier age than in PAC. Intraocular surgery is frequently complicated by choroidal effusion and nonrhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Choroidal effusion may occur spontaneously and may induce angle closure. Laser iridotomy, argon laser peripheral iridoplasty, and medical therapy are the safest ways to manage glaucoma in these patients. Surgery should be avoided if possible because of the high rate of surgical complications. When intraocular surgery is employed, prophylactic posterior sclerotomies may reduce the severity of intraoperative choroidal effusion. Additional treatment options include lensectomy for angles that remain compromised despite a patent iridotomy. In such cases, a limited core vitrectomy is sometimes necessary to provide adequate ACD for subsequent, safe lens removal. Many clinicians consider early lens extraction in patients with nanophthalmos to avoid the development of angle closure.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Persistent Fetal Vasculature</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The contracting retrolental tissue seen in persistent fetal vasculature (PFV; formerly known as <span class="italic">persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous</span>) and in retinopathy of prematurity can cause progressive shallowing of the anterior chamber angle with subsequent angle closure. These conditions are discussed in more detail in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> and Section&#160;12, <span class="italic">Retina and Vitreous.</span> In PFV, the onset of this complication usually occurs at 3–6&#160;months of age during the cicatricial phase of the disease. However, the angle closure may occur later in childhood.</p>
			<p class="body-text">PFV is usually unilateral and often associated with microphthalmos and elongated ciliary processes. The contracture of the hyperplastic primary vitreous and swelling of a cataractous lens may result in subsequent angle closure.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Flat Anterior Chamber</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A flat anterior chamber from any cause can result in the formation of PAS. Debate continues concerning how long a postoperative flat chamber should be treated conservatively before surgical intervention is undertaken. Hypotony in an eye with a postoperative flat chamber following cataract surgery or filtering surgery indicates a wound leak until proven otherwise. A Seidel test should be performed to locate the leak. Simple pressure patching or bandage contact lens application will often cause the leak to seal and the chamber to re-form. If the chamber does not re-form, the leak should be repaired surgically to prevent synechial closure of the angle or other complications of hypotony.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some ophthalmologists repair the wound leak and re-form a flat chamber following cataract surgery within 24&#160;hours. Others prefer observation in conjunction with corticosteroid therapy for several&#160;days to prevent formation of synechiae. Although iridocorneal contact is well tolerated, contact between the cornea and the hyaloid face or an IOL requires re-formation of the chamber without delay to minimize corneal endothelial damage. Early intervention should also be considered in the presence of corneal edema, excessive inflammation, or posterior synechiae formation.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Drug-Induced Secondary Angle-&#173;Closure Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Topiramate, a sulfamate-&#173;substituted monosaccharide, is an oral medication prescribed in the treatment of epilepsy, depression, headaches, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. In some patients, this medication may cause a syndrome characterized by acute myopic shift and acute bilateral angle closure. Patients with this syndrome experience sudden bilateral vision loss with acute myopia, bilateral ocular pain, and headache, usually within 1&#160;month of starting topiramate. In addition to myopia, ocular findings of this syndrome include a uniformly shallow anterior chamber with anterior displacement of the iris and lens, microcystic corneal edema, elevated IOP (40–70&#160;mm&#160;Hg), a closed anterior chamber angle, and a ciliochoroidal effusion/detachment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;5-24</span>). Other medications associated with uveal effusions with secondary angle closure include acetazolamide, methazolamide, and trimethoprim-&#173;sulfamethoxazole.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The bilateral nature of this form of angle closure should alert the clinician to the possibility of an idiosyncratic response to topiramate. Treatment of this syndrome involves immediate discontinuation of the medication and initiation of medical therapy to decrease the IOP, generally in the form of aqueous suppressants. In addition, systemic agents such as acetazolamide may be administered orally or intravenously. Aggressive cycloplegia may help deepen the anterior chamber and relieve the attack. The secondary angle closure usually resolves within 24–48&#160;hours with medical treatment, and the myopia resolves within 1–2&#160;weeks of discontinuing the topiramate. Because pupillary block is not an underlying mechanism of this syndrome, a peripheral iridotomy is not indicated. Other sulfonamides, such as acetazolamide, have been reported to cause a similar clinical syndrome.</p>
