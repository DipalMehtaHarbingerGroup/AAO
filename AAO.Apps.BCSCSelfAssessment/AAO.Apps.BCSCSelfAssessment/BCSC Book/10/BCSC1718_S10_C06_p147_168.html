			<p class="chapter-title">Glaucoma in Children and Adolescents</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The glaucomas of childhood and adolescence (herein called pediatric glaucomas) are a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and optic nerve damage. Various presentations and etiologies characterize these rare glaucomas. Although pediatric glaucomas share many characteristics with adult-&#173;onset glaucomas, there are numerous management issues that are unique to the pediatric and adolescent populations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> for additional discussion of many of the topics covered in this chapter.</p>
			<p class="h1">Classification</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many systems have been used to classify the pediatric glaucomas. The World Glaucoma Association, for example, classifies them into primary and secondary glaucomas (see Table&#160;22-1 in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>). The classifications presented in <span class="xref-table">Tables&#160;6-1 and 6-2</span> in this book are based on anatomical anomalies, age of onset, inheritance, and associated systemic disorders. Most of these systems divide the glaucomas into primary and secondary glaucomas, although there is some overlap in this classification (eg, Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome is both a primary and a secondary glaucoma). <span class="italic">Primary</span> pediatric glaucomas are developmental glaucomas with congenital anomalies of the filtration angle, and they can be subdivided as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first">primary congenital glaucoma (congenital open-&#173;angle glaucoma)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">juvenile open-&#173;angle glaucoma</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">glaucoma associated with ocular developmental anomalies</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last">glaucoma associated with systemic diseases</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Children with <span class="italic">primary congenital glaucoma (PCG)</span> present with enlarged and/or cloudy corneas, Haab striae, and elevated IOP—the classic features of PCG. PCG may present at birth or before 1&#160;month of age (newborn PCG), within the first 2&#160;years of life (infantile PCG), or after 2&#160;years of age (late-&#173;diagnosed PCG). <span class="italic">Juvenile open-&#173;angle glau</span><span class="italic">coma</span> develops later in childhood or in early adulthood. Primary pediatric glaucomas are associated with abnormal development of the anterior segment, as in aniridia or Peters anomaly. In addition, primary pediatric glaucoma can be associated with a number of systemic diseases, including chromosomal disorders, connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan and Stickler syndromes), and the phakomatoses.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Secondary</span> pediatric glaucomas arise from multiple etiologies, including trauma, intraocular neoplasms, inflammation, lens-&#173;induced disorders, surgical interventions, angle closure, infection, neovascularization, corticosteroid use, or elevated episcleral venous pressure (see Table&#160;6-2).</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Genetics</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most cases of PCG occur sporadically. A familial pattern of inheritance is seen in 10%–40% of cases, usually autosomal recessive with incomplete or variable penetrance. Linkage studies have identified 4&#160;genetic loci of PCG—GLC3A, GLC3B, GLC3C, and GLC3D—but additional loci likely exist (see Chapter&#160;1, Table&#160;1-4). Two main genes associated with PCG have been identified:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first"><span class="italic">CYP1B1</span> (cytochrome P450, family&#160;1, subfamily&#160;B, polypeptide&#160;1) within the GLC3A locus</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last"><span class="italic">LTBP2</span> (latent transforming growth factor beta-&#173;binding protein&#160;2) within the GLC3C locus</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">Most cases of juvenile open-&#173;angle glaucoma have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, but sporadic cases occasionally occur. Juvenile open-&#173;angle glaucoma has been linked to mutations in the <span class="italic">TIGR</span> (trabecular meshwork inducible glucocorticoid response)/<span class="italic">MYOC</span> (myocilin) gene located at the GLC1A locus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some forms of primary pediatric glaucoma are associated with ocular abnormalities, including aniridia, Axenfeld-&#173;Rieger syndrome, and Peters anomaly. Aniridia results from mutations in the <span class="italic">PAX6</span> gene (paired box&#160;6). Two-thirds of aniridia cases are autosomal dominant and one-third are sporadic. Axenfeld-&#173;Rieger syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and presents with a variety of phenotypes. Mutations <br />in the <span class="italic">PITX2</span> gene (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor&#160;2), located at 4q25, and the <span class="italic">FOXC1</span> gene (forkhead box C1), located at 6p25, have been linked to this syndrome. The variable interaction between these 2&#160;genes may underlie the diverse phenotypic expression associated with Axenfeld-&#173;Rieger syndrome. Peters anomaly has been linked to mutations in <span class="italic">PITX2, FOXC1, CYP1B1,</span> and <span class="italic">PAX6.</span></p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Primary Congenital Glaucoma</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) accounts for the majority of primary pediatric glaucomas. Most cases are bilateral (70%) and are diagnosed within the first year of life (&gt;75%). PCG occurs more frequently in males (65%) than females. The incidence varies with ethnicity, ranging from 1 in 1250&#160;live births in Slovak Roms to 1 in 18,500&#160;live births in Great Britain. Consanguinity greatly increases the risk. Without a family history of PCG, an affected parent has a 2% chance of having a child with PCG.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Newborn PCG accounts for approximately 25% of PCG cases and confers a worse prognosis than infantile PCG. More than 50% of patients with newborn PCG progress to legal blindness. The prognosis is also worse if the glaucoma is diagnosed after 1&#160;year of age and if the corneal diameters are larger than 14&#160;mm at diagnosis. The prognosis is best for patients whose glaucoma is diagnosed between the ages of 3 and 12&#160;months, as most of these children respond to angle surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In PCG, the pathophysiologic defect is increased resistance to outflow through the trabecular meshwork. Ophthalmologist Otto Barkan hypothesized that this resistance was caused by a membrane covering the anterior chamber angle. Although this membrane has not been identified, individuals with PCG have a developmental anomaly of the neural crest–derived tissue of the anterior chamber angle, with dysgenesis and compression of the trabecular meshwork and an anterior insertion of the iris root (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-1</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">PCG in infancy presents with the classic triad of epiphora, photophobia, and blepharospasm. Until 3&#160;years of age, elevated IOP causes the cornea to stretch, leading to increased corneal diameter and enlargement of the globe (buphthalmos). The corneal stretching produces <span class="italic">Haab striae,</span> or breaks in the Descemet membrane, and may lead to corneal edema and corneal opacification (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-2</span>; also see Figs&#160;22-1 and 22-2 in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</span>). As the cornea swells, the child may become irritable and photophobic. After age 3&#160;years, the cornea ceases to enlarge further. Scleral stretching also ceases around age 3–4&#160;years. However, persistently elevated IOP may result in continued optic nerve damage.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The extensive differential diagnosis of PCG is presented in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-3</span>. PCG should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any child who presents with epiphora. PCG is a relatively rare disease and may go undetected or be misdiagnosed by primary care doctors and general ophthalmologists. Mild cases may be misdiagnosed as nasolacrimal duct obstruction, resulting in a delayed PCG diagnosis and irreversible damage. Physicians must be vigilant in their examination and urgently refer infants presenting with the classic triad of epiphora, photophobia, and blepharospasm to a specialist. Left untreated, almost all cases of PCG will progress to blindness.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of PCG typically requires surgical intervention (see the Surgical Management section later in this chapter). Medical therapy has limited long-term value but may be used to temporize or reduce corneal edema to improve visualization during surgery.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Juvenile Open-Angle Glaucoma</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Juvenile open-&#173;angle glaucoma (JOAG) is a form of primary open-&#173;angle glaucoma that presents between the ages of 4 and 35&#160;years with elevated IOP and usually normal-&#173;appearing angles. Because most cases of JOAG are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, many families may be aware of their risk of developing this condition, leading to earlier screening and detection. Although the IOP is elevated, it does not usually cause corneal enlargement or Haab striae due to the later age of onset; however, progressive myopia may result and continue until 10&#160;years of age. Medical therapy is usually unsuccessful, and most patients require trabeculectomy or implantation of glaucoma tube shunts. Angle procedures may be helpful in select cases.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Developmental Glaucomas With Associated Ocular or Systemic Anomalies</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The pediatric glaucomas may be associated with various ocular and systemic abnormalities, as summarized in Tables&#160;6-1 and&#160;6-2. The following sections discuss a few of the more common conditions.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Axenfeld-Rieger (A-R) syndrome is a spectrum of disorders characterized by anomalous development of the neural crest–derived anterior segment structures, including the anterior chamber angle, the iris, and the trabecular meshwork. Most cases of A-R syndrome are of autosomal dominant inheritance, but sporadic cases can occur. The disorder is bilateral, with no sex predilection. Approximately 50% of cases are associated with glaucoma, typically occurring in middle or late childhood.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although this syndrome was initially separated into Axenfeld anomaly (posterior embryotoxon with multiple adherent peripheral iris strands), Rieger anomaly (Axenfeld anomaly plus iris hypoplasia and corectopia), and Rieger syndrome (Rieger anomaly plus developmental defects of the teeth or facial bones, including maxillary hypoplasia, redundant periumbilical skin, pituitary abnormalities, or hypospadias), these disorders are now considered variations of the same clinical entity and are combined under the name <span class="italic">Axenfeld-&#173;Rieger syndrome.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">Classic clinical manifestations include posterior embryotoxon of the cornea (a prominent and anteriorly displaced Schwalbe line) and iris adhesions to the Schwalbe line that range from threadlike to broad bands. The iris may range from normal to markedly atrophic with corectopia, hole formation, and ectropion uveae. A-R syndrome can be distinguished from other conditions that involve abnormalities of the iris, cornea, and anterior chamber, as outlined in <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-4</span>.</p>
			<p class="h2">Peters Anomaly</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Peters anomaly is a developmental condition presenting with an annular corneal opacity (leukoma) in the central visual axis, often accompanied by iris strands originating at the iris collarette and adhering to the corneal opacity. The leukoma corresponds to a defect in the corneal endothelium and underlying Descemet membrane and posterior stroma. The lens may be in its normal position, with or without a cataract, or the lens may be adherent to the posterior layers of the cornea. Patients with corneolenticular adhesions have a higher likelihood of other ocular abnormalities, such as microcornea and angle anomalies, and of systemic abnormalities, including those of the heart, genitourinary tract, musculoskeletal system, ear, palate, and spine.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Peters anomaly is usually sporadic, although autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms have been reported. Most cases are bilateral, and angle abnormalities leading to glaucoma occur in approximately 50% of affected patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The glaucoma associated with Peters anomaly is difficult to treat because of the iridocorneal dysgenesis. Angle surgery is performed if possible; alternative treatments include medications, trabeculectomy, glaucoma tube shunts, and cyclodestructive procedures.</p>
			<p class="h2">Aniridia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Aniridia is a panocular, bilateral congenital disorder characterized by iris hypoplasia. Most patients with aniridia have only a rudimentary stump of iris; however, the iris appearance may vary greatly, with some patients having nearly complete but thin irides. Aniridia is associated with other ocular anomalies, including small corneas, anterior polar cataracts that may present at birth or develop later in life, and optic nerve and foveal hypoplasia resulting in pendular nystagmus and reduced vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Glaucoma develops in approximately 50%–75% of patients with aniridia. Aniridia is occasionally associated with congenital glaucoma; usually, however, the glaucoma develops after the rudimentary iris stump rotates anteriorly to progressively cover the trabecular meshwork, resulting in synechial angle closure. This angle closure is a gradual process, and glaucoma may not occur until the second decade of life or later. Primary maldevelopment of the drainage angle may also result in elevated IOP at a younger age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Patients with aniridia may have limbal stem cell abnormalities that eventually result in a corneal pannus, which begins in the peripheral cornea and slowly extends centrally. There may be a role for limbal stem cell transplants in these patients.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most cases of aniridia are familial and are transmitted with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern; however, about one-third of cases are isolated sporadic mutations resulting from <span class="italic">PAX6</span> defects. Approximately 20% of sporadic cases are associated with a large chromosomal deletion that includes the adjacent Wilms tumor&#160;1 gene <span class="italic">(WT1),</span> a tumor suppressor gene, which results in an increased risk of Wilms tumor. Relatively few cases of Wilms tumor are seen in the familial form.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Two less-common forms of aniridia are associated with systemic abnormalities. <span class="italic">WAGR</span> (<span class="italic">W</span>ilms tumor, <span class="italic">a</span>niridia, <span class="italic">g</span>enitourinary anomalies, and mental <span class="italic">r</span>etardation) <span class="italic">syndrome</span> is an autosomal dominant form seen in 13% of patients with aniridia. <span class="italic">Gillespie syndrome</span> is an autosomal recessive form of aniridia associated with cerebellar ataxia and intellectual disability that occurs in 2% of those with aniridia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Prophylactic goniosurgery may be beneficial for infants with a strong family history of aniridic glaucoma or for young children with progressive narrowing of an angle that is still open. Once the angle is closed, trabeculectomy, glaucoma tube shunts, and cyclodestruction may be required for IOP control. Thus, it is important to closely monitor the angle anatomy with serial gonioscopy.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Sturge-Weber Syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS; also known as <span class="italic">encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis</span>) is a phakomatosis with ipsilateral facial cutaneous hemangioma (nevus flammeus or port-wine stain), ipsilateral choroidal cavernous hemangioma (tomato ketchup fundus), and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma associated with cerebral calcifications, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and a variable degree of cognitive impairment. The condition is usually unilateral but can present bilaterally in rare instances. There is no race or sex predilection, and no inheritance pattern has been established. Glaucoma occurs in 30%–70% of children with SWS and is more common when the nevus flammeus involves the eyelids. When seen in infants with this syndrome, the glaucoma is thought to be due to congenital anterior chamber anomalies (similar to PCG). Glaucoma that develops after the first decade of life may be caused by elevated episcleral venous pressure. Tra&#173;beculectomy should be performed with caution because of an increased risk of choroidal effusion and choroidal hemorrhage in these patients.</p>
			<p class="h2">Neurofibromatosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Neurofibromatosis (NF), the most common phakomatosis, has 2&#160;recognizable forms. Neurofibromatosis&#160;1 (NF1), also known as <span class="italic">von Recklinghausen disease</span> or <span class="italic">peripheral neurofibromatosis,</span> is the most common type, with a prevalence of 1 in 3000–5000&#160;persons. NF1 is localized to band&#160;11 of the long arm of chromosome&#160;17 and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion in approximately 50% of cases; the other 50% of cases are sporadic. Ectropion uveae is a common ocular finding whose presence in a neonate should prompt a workup for NF1. Other ocular findings associated with NF1 include Lisch nodules, optic nerve gliomas, eyelid neurofibromas, and glaucoma. Systemic findings include cutaneous café-au-lait spots, cutaneous neurofibromas, and axillary or inguinal freckling.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Neurofibromatosis&#160;2, or <span class="italic">central neurofibromatosis,</span> is defined by the presence of bilateral acoustic neuromas and is not associated with glaucoma.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Secondary Glaucomas</p>
				<div id="Chapt6_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many of the causes of secondary glaucoma in infants and children are similar to those in adults (see Table&#160;6-2), including trauma, inflammation, steroid use, and topiramate-&#173;induced angle closure. Lens-&#173;associated disorders causing angle-&#173;closure glaucoma may occur in patients with Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, Weill-&#173;Marchesani syndrome, and microspherophakia. Posterior segment disorders such as persistent fetal vasculature, retinopathy of prematurity, and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, as well as tumors of the retina, iris, or ciliary body, can also result in glaucoma. Retinoblastoma, juvenile xanthogranuloma, and medulloepithelioma are some of the intraocular tumors known to lead to secondary glaucoma in infants and children. Rubella and congenital cataract are important conditions that are also associated with secondary pediatric glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Aphakic Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Glaucoma develops in 15%–50% or more of children who have undergone surgery for congenital cataract. Risk factors for aphakic glaucoma include cataract surgery in the first year of life, postoperative complications, and small corneal diameter. Although most aphakic glaucoma develops in patients within 3&#160;years of cataract surgery, these patients are always at risk for glaucoma and thus require lifelong follow-&#173;up. The underlying mechanism is unclear, but likely etiologies include congenital anomalies, surgically induced inflammation, and altered intraocular anatomy postoperatively. Removing all residual cortex during cataract surgery may reduce the occurrence of pediatric aphakic glaucoma.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Evaluating the Pediatric Glaucoma Patient</p>
				<div id="Chapt6_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A pediatric glaucoma patient should be evaluated differently than an adult with glaucoma. Ophthalmologists should proceed with an orderly system of examination and the appropriate equipment for evaluating infants and young children in both the office and the operating room (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;6-5</span>). For examinations under anesthesia (EUAs), efficiency in measuring and recording data in the operating room can minimize the time that the patient is under anesthesia.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">History</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When evaluating an infant, the ophthalmologist should ask the caregiver whether the baby is fussy or irritable, whether the child is not feeding well or is losing weight, and whether the baby cries when taken outside into sunshine. The caregiver’s observations regarding any corneal clouding should be sought, specifically as to whether the clouding is intermittent or constant.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For evaluation of school-aged children, the ophthalmologist should inquire about the results of school vision screenings, changes in academic performance, and complaints about trouble seeing in the classroom. A complete record of the patient’s history should include the names of previous physicians who have been consulted; all prior ocular and systemic medical and surgical treatments; any family history of congenital glaucoma and other ocular and systemic disorders; medication use (with particular attention to all forms of steroids); and allergies.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Visual Acuity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Testing of visual acuity in infants and young children is discussed in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.</span> Refraction should be performed to identify any myopia from axial enlargement, and/or astigmatism from corneal irregularity. Decreased vision may be due to significant glaucomatous optic nerve damage, amblyopia, corneal scarring, or other associated ocular disorders (eg, retinal detachment, macular edema, cataract, lens dislocation).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">External Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ophthalmologist should look for buphthalmos (see Fig&#160;6-2) and other signs and symptoms of PCG, including epiphora and blepharospasm, as well as features that may be associated with primary and secondary glaucomas other than PCG. These features include chromosomal abnormalities, phakomatoses, connective tissue disorders, and A-R syndrome.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Anterior Segment Examination</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">As discussed previously, corneal enlargement and opacification are important signs associated with glaucoma in patients younger than 3&#160;years. Corneal diameter should be measured with calipers or a ruler. The normal corneal diameter is approximately 9.5–10.5&#160;mm in full-term newborns, increasing to 11–12&#160;mm by 1&#160;year of age. In contrast, eyes with congenital glaucoma may have a corneal diameter greater than 12&#160;mm in the first year of life. Corneal edema may be due to elevated IOP or Haab striae and may range from mild haze to dense opacification of the corneal stroma (see Fig&#160;6-2). Retroillumination after pupillary dilation may help make Haab striae visible. Evaluation for other anterior segment anomalies, such as aniridia, iridocorneal adhesions, and corectopia, may provide insight into the underlying diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Tonometry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Accurate tonometry is vital in the assessment of the pediatric glaucomas. IOP may be falsely elevated in an uncooperative or struggling child. Often, the clinician can successfully measure the IOP of an infant younger than 6&#160;months without general anesthesia or sedation by performing the measurement while the infant is feeding or immediately thereafter. For this group of patients, the Tono-&#173;Pen (Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments, Depew, NY) or pneumatonometer works best for in-&#173;office tonometry. The Perkins tonometer can also be helpful for children who are too young to cooperate for Goldmann tonometry at the slit lamp. The rebound tonometer, a newer instrument that does not require topical anesthesia, is playing a greater role in the office because it can decrease the need for EUAs when obtaining IOP. It also can be used for measuring IOP in the pediatric patient’s home. However, despite these advantages, initial reports indicate that measurements in patients with congenital glaucoma were higher with the rebound tonometer than with the Perkins tonometer.</p>
			<p class="body-text">General anesthesia is usually required for accurate IOP assessment of older infants (≥6&#160;months) and young children. However, most general anesthetic agents and sedatives can profoundly lower IOP. Exceptions include chloral hydrate, which does not affect IOP, and ketamine, which may increase IOP. In addition, the preparation for general anesthesia may cause infants to become dehydrated, which can reduce IOP. Increased IOP during general anesthesia may result from endotracheal intubation, upward drift of the eyes, or possible induced laryngospasm. It is best to coordinate with the anesthesiologist before the child is brought to the operating room and arrange to take the IOP measurement immediately after induction of general anesthesia (preferably before intubation), which should minimize the effects of anesthesia on IOP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Normal IOP in newborns is in the low teens; by middle childhood, IOP increases to adult levels of 10–20&#160;mm Hg. Glaucoma should be suspected if IOPs are elevated or asymmetric in a cooperative or anesthetized child.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Pachymetry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The role of pachymetry in the diagnosis and management of pediatric glaucoma is unclear. The average central corneal thickness (CCT) is 540–560&#160;µm in children without glaucoma. CCT is lower than average in eyes with congenital glaucoma and in children with Down syndrome; CCT is higher than average in eyes with aphakic glaucoma and aniridia. It is also slightly higher in premature infants. The effect of CCT on the accuracy of IOP measurements in these groups is unclear, and nomograms cannot accurately be used to “correct” IOP measurements for differences in CCT measurements.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Gonioscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Gonioscopy provides important information about the mechanism of the pediatric glaucoma as well as evidence of a patient’s prior surgeries. An EUA is usually required for gonioscopic examination of younger children. A Koeppe lens allows direct visualization of the angle structures. In older children, indirect gonioscopy can be performed with a 4-mirror goniolens at the slit lamp.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The normal anterior chamber angle of an infant differs from the normal adult angle in several ways, including a less pigmented trabecular meshwork, a less prominent Schwalbe line, and a less distinct junction between the scleral spur and ciliary body band. In PCG, the anterior chamber is deep, with a high anterior iris insertion. The angle recess is absent, and the iris root appears as a scalloped line of glistening tissue. Although this tissue is not a true membrane, it has been referred to as the <span class="italic">Barkan membrane</span> and likely represents thickened and compacted trabecular meshwork (see Fig&#160;6-1).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In JOAG, the angle usually appears normal. In aniridia, gonioscopy reveals a rudimentary iris root with progressive narrowing of the angle that eventually results in synechial closure.</p>
			<p class="h2">Optic Nerve and Fundus Evaluation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Visualization and documentation of the optic nerve are crucial to the evaluation and management of pediatric glaucomas. Evaluation of the optic nerve is often performed with direct ophthalmoscopy, which can be done in the office or operating room. Alternatively, indirect ophthalmoscopy can be used. In patients with small pupils, viewing can be enhanced through a Koeppe lens without a dimple. In older children, slit-lamp biomicroscopy can be performed. Photographs provide the best documentation and help the ophthalmologist evaluate changes over time.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A typical newborn without glaucoma has a small physiologic cup (cup–disc ratio [CDR] less than 0.3) with a pink rim. In PCG, the optic canal is stretched and the lamina cribrosa is bowed backward, causing generalized enlargement of the cup. Enlarged or increasing CDR or CDR asymmetry greater than 0.2 between the 2&#160;eyes is suggestive of glaucomatous cupping. Cupping may be reversible if the IOP is lowered; however, lowering IOP cannot reverse any existing atrophy of the optic nerve axons.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">A-Scan Ultrasonography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Serial measurements of axial length using A-scan ultrasonography can document progressive globe enlargement in patients with PCG. Axial length may stabilize or decrease with control of IOP and thus serves as a critical marker for successful control of IOP.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Other Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">B-scan ultrasonography should be performed if media opacities, particularly corneal edema, preclude fundus evaluation. Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography can provide useful longitudinal data in older children with clear media; however, no normative databases are available for children.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">Treatment Overview</p>
			<div id="Chapt6_Top8">
			<p class="h2-h1">Surgical Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Surgery is the preferred, definitive treatment of most cases of PCG; medications have limited long-term value. In other forms of pediatric glaucoma, medication can better control IOP, but a high percentage of these cases also eventually require surgery. Goniotomy and ab externo trabeculotomy are the procedures of choice for the treatment of PCG. Either procedure is appropriate if the cornea is clear. If the cornea is cloudy, goniotomy is difficult because of poor visualization of the target structures; trabeculotomy is thus more easily performed. In patients with clear corneas, angle surgery with either of these procedures yields a 70%–80% success rate in children with PCG diagnosed between 3 and 12&#160;months of age. Angle surgery may also be used to treat other forms of pediatric glaucoma, including glaucoma associated with aniridia, A-R syndrome, or Sturge-&#173;Weber syndrome. Trabeculectomy and glaucoma tube shunt implantation should be reserved for congenital glaucoma cases in which goniotomy or trabeculotomy has failed or for treatment of other forms of pediatric glaucoma. Cyclodestruction is necessary in some intractable cases, but because of the risk of phthisis bulbi, it should be avoided if possible.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Glaucoma surgery in children poses unique difficulties. For example, in PCG, the anatomical landmarks are distorted in the buphthalmic eye, and the thin sclera presents additional difficulties during trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy. The surgeon performing glaucoma surgery in pediatric patients should be experienced in handling these challenges and able to provide the necessary environment for evaluating these patients postoperatively. Additional surgery is often required, so the surgeon should also develop a long-term plan in order to keep surgical options available for the future and to minimize the risk of visual compromise.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The decision to proceed with angle surgery is often made during an EUA; ideally, if glaucoma is diagnosed, angle surgery should be performed during the same anesthesia session in order to minimize the number of general anesthesia sessions for the child. If angle surgery is anticipated, it is best not to dilate the eye during the EUA in order to protect the lens during the surgical procedure.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In a goniotomy, the angle is visualized with a surgical gonioscopic contact lens, a needle knife is passed across the anterior chamber, and a superficial incision is made <br />in the uveal trabecular meshwork (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-3</span>). A clear cornea is required in order to visualize the angle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In a trabeculotomy, the Schlemm canal is cannulated from an external approach, and the trabecular meshwork is opened by breaking through the Schlemm canal into the anterior chamber. The procedure begins with creation of a conjunctival flap, beneath which a partial-&#173;thickness scleral flap is created, similar to a trabeculectomy. Beneath that partial-&#173;thickness scleral flap, the surgeon identifies the Schlemm canal, either by creating a radial incision into the sclera or by dissecting a deep scleral flap and noting the canal at the edges of this flap. Alternatively, the surgeon can identify the canal edges after unroofing the Schlemm canal by creating a single deep scleral flap. The surgeon inserts a fine wirelike instrument (trabeculotome) into the Schlemm canal and then rotates it into the anterior chamber, tearing the trabecular meshwork (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;6-4</span>). Alternatively, a 6-0 nonabsorbable polypropylene suture can be fed through the Schlemm canal for its entire 360° circumference and pulled tautly into the anterior chamber. When using either the trabeculotome or the suture, the surgeon must take care to avoid creating a false passage or entering the subretinal or suprachoroidal spaces.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Another option in trabeculotomy is the use of a fiber-&#173;optic microcatheter to cannulate the Schlemm canal until the cannula passes through 360°. The ends of the catheter can then be grasped and pulled in opposite directions to perform a 360° trabeculotomy. An advantage of using this catheter is that the surgeon knows where the leading catheter tip is at all times because of the red light that illuminates it (see Chapter 8, Video 8-6).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many surgeons inject viscoelastic into the anterior chamber at the start of goniotomy and trabeculotomy in order to prevent collapse of the chamber and to tamponade bleeding intraoperatively. Thorough removal of the viscoelastic at the end of the procedure is necessary to prevent a postoperative spike in IOP.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The success rates of these 2&#160;angle surgeries are similar, but each procedure has its advantages and disadvantages. When the cornea is clear, goniotomy has the following advantages over trabeculotomy: there is no postoperative conjunctival scarring (scarring could limit future filtering surgery); the procedure is much faster; and there is less trauma to the anterior segment tissues. Trabeculotomy offers the following advantages: the approach to trabeculotomy is more familiar to surgeons experienced in adult glaucoma procedures; it can be performed in an opacified cornea; and it can be converted to a trabeculectomy if the Schlemm canal cannot be cannulated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Complications associated with these procedures include hyphema, infection, lens damage, and uveitis. The Descemet membrane may be stripped during a trabeculotomy. General anesthesia may cause serious complications in children; to minimize these risks bilateral procedures are performed in some children.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Angle surgery has a success rate of 70%–80% in infants presenting with PCG between 3 and 12&#160;months of age; this success rate includes repeated angle procedures, which is common in this disease. Trabeculectomy or implantation of a glaucoma tube shunt should be considered when 2 or more angle surgeries are not successful in lowering the IOP or when adjunctive medical therapy is inadequate. Surgeons should also consider these options for children who have forms of glaucoma other than PCG, although angle surgery is often successful in aphakic glaucoma and in new onset of glaucoma associated with aniridia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If angle surgery is not successful, the surgeon must take several factors into account when deciding between trabeculectomy and implantation of a glaucoma tube shunt as the next procedure. Trabeculectomy has a low success rate in children younger than 2&#160;years and in aphakic eyes. Bleb scarring and failure are very prevalent without the use of antifibrotics, but there are serious risks of bleb leaks and bleb infections with the use of these agents. To avoid the risk of blebitis and endophthalmitis, mitomycin&#160;C <br />(MMC)–augmented trabeculectomy should be performed with caution in pediatric patients who are too young to understand good hygiene, which is necessary to minimize the chances of infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Glaucoma tube shunts are useful for lowering IOP and lack the risk of bleb-&#173;related infections. Success rates vary with different tube shunts, diagnoses, and patient ages. Complications include anterior migration of the tube shunt with resultant corneal damage, tube blockage, tube erosion with resultant endophthalmitis, cataract, motility disturbances, bleb encapsulation with elevated IOP, and pupil distortion. The IOPs are usually higher after implantation of these devices than after successful trabeculectomy, and most of the children who have undergone implantation will need to continue using topical glaucoma medications. The various styles and sizes of glaucoma tube shunts can help individualize the surgery to the patient’s situation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Cyclodestruction is reserved for cases refractory to other surgical and medical treatments. Cyclodestructive procedures lower IOP by causing areas of the ciliary body to atrophy, resulting in less aqueous production. Cyclodestructive techniques include <br />cyclocryotherapy, transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (CPC) with the Nd:YAG or diode laser, and endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation (ECP). When these techniques are used in pediatric patients, general anesthesia is required. The rate of complications is lower with cyclodestructive laser procedures than with cryotherapy. One disadvantage of cyclodestructive procedures is the difficulty in titrating the results. Another disadvantage is the serious potential complications—which include hypotony, uveitis, retinal detachment, phthisis bulbi, and blindness. The most common cyclodestructive modalities currently used are transscleral CPC with the diode laser and ECP. Transscleral CPC is a noninvasive procedure, whereas ECP is an intraocular procedure in which the laser energy is applied under direct visualization, causing less damage to adjacent tissues. ECP is particularly useful in eyes with distorted anterior segment anatomy and in eyes with prior unsuccessful CPC or cryotherapy. Transscleral CPC and ECP can be very useful for providing additional IOP lowering after glaucoma tube shunt surgery.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-11">Medical Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Although surgical management is the foundation of PCG care, medications are frequently required in the treatment of PCG and other pediatric glaucomas. Medications can be used to lower IOP before surgery in order to reduce corneal edema and improve visualization during surgery. They may also be used after surgical procedures in order to provide additional IOP lowering. Medical therapy may also be useful in treating JOAG, inflammatory glaucoma, and aphakic glaucoma and other secondary glaucomas. The safety and efficacy of most FDA-&#173;approved glaucoma medications have not been studied in controlled clinical trials specifically in children, although most clinicians are guided by extensive clinical experience. When the patient is a preadolescent or adolescent female, clinicians must inquire about pregnancy before initiating any treatment that might affect a fetus. A full discussion of glaucoma medications can be found in Chapter&#160;7.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12"><span class="CharOverride-1">b</span>-Adrenergic antagonists</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-Adrenergic antagonists, or <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blockers, decrease aqueous production in the ciliary body and thus can be useful for controlling IOP in children. Topical <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists are considered first-line therapy for glaucoma in children. These agents must be used with caution, however. The systemic absorption of these agents is considerable—even with topical application—and can cause bronchospasm, bradycardia, and hypotension in susceptible children. <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-Blockers should thus be avoided in children with asthma or significant cardiac disease. To decrease the risk of bronchospasm, the clinician may consider administering the cardioselective <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-blocker betaxolol. The risk of adverse effects can also be diminished with occlusion of the nasolacrimal drainage system for 3&#160;minutes after administration and use of a lower dose (eg, timolol 0.25% or levobunolol 0.25% as opposed to 0.5%), particularly for young children. The clinician should teach parents how to occlude the nasolacrimal drainage system for administration at home. Patients with lighter irides may respond as well to timolol 0.25% or levobunolol 0.25% as they do to 0.5% of the same medications.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Like <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-adrenergic antagonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) decrease IOP by reducing aqueous production. Topical use of dorzolamide or brinzolamide has a minimal risk of systemic adverse effects and is also an excellent first-line therapy. Systemic CAIs (acetazolamide and methazolamide) provide slightly more IOP lowering than the topical preparations but have numerous systemic adverse effects. The pediatric dosage of acetazolamide is 10–20&#160;mg/kg/day. CAIs should not be used in patients with known serious sulfa allergies. Adverse effects of CAIs include anorexia, diarrhea, weight loss, tingling of the perioral areas and fingers, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, which can affect bone growth, and risk of sickle cell crisis in sickle cell anemia; children using diuretics are particularly at risk for these adverse effects. Because of the risk of these effects and of rare but life-&#173;threatening reactions such as Stevens-&#173;Johnson syndrome and aplastic anemia, systemic CAIs are reserved for patients at great risk of vision loss due to highly elevated IOP.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12"><span class="CharOverride-1">a</span>-Adrenergic agonists</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-Adrenergic agonists lower IOP by diminishing aqueous production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. The <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonist brimonidine, which crosses the blood–brain barrier, may have significant effects on the central nervous system, including apnea, hypotension, bradycardia, hypotonia, hypothermia, and somnolence. Infants and young children are particularly susceptible to brimonidine’s adverse effects; thus <span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-adrenergic agonists are contraindicated in children younger than 3&#160;years. There is some debate about the age at which children can safely use brimonidine. In general, it should be used with caution in children between the ages of 3 and 10&#160;years old. The lowest dose possible should be used and punctal occlusion employed to minimize systemic absorption.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="greek--tx-">a</span>-adrenergic agonist apraclonidine is better tolerated systemically in children, but the risk of follicular conjunctivitis increases with long-term use. Apraclonidine also acts as a vasoconstrictor and can be used to minimize bleeding during intraocular surgery.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-12">Prostaglandin analogues</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prostaglandin analogues lower IOP by increasing uveoscleral outflow. They have minimal systemic side effects in children and have been shown to effectively lower IOP in JOAG. However, they can exacerbate uveitis in postoperative glaucoma patients, so they should be avoided in patients with uncontrolled uveitis. Their once-&#173;daily dosing can help minimize the stress involved in administering eyedrops to children. Adverse effects include conjunctival hyperemia, hypertrichosis and trichiasis, periocular pigmentation (reversible), and permanent darkening of irides, except in blue-eyed patients.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Cholinergic agonists</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cholinergic agonists (miotics) lower IOP by increasing aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. Because newer medications are available, these agents are rarely used on a long-term basis. However, they have a role intraoperatively by inducing miosis, which facilitates angle surgery.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-15">Prognosis and Follow-Up</p>
				<div id="Chapt6_Top9">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The development of effective surgical techniques has greatly improved the long-term prognosis for pediatric glaucoma patients, particularly PCG patients asymptomatic at birth who present with onset of symptoms between 3 and 12&#160;months of age. These patients have a good prognosis, although multiple surgeries may be required. When symptoms are present at birth or when the disease is diagnosed after 12&#160;months of age, the prognosis for surgical control of IOP is poor.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pediatric patients whose IOP is controlled by surgery may still experience morbidities related to previous IOP elevation, including amblyopia, corneal scarring, strabismus, anisometropia, cataract, lens subluxation, susceptibility to trauma (eg, as in an eye with a thinned sclera), and recurrent glaucoma in the affected or unaffected eye. These morbidities can cause serious long-term visual compromise and thus should be addressed by clinicians promptly.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Amblyopia is a common cause of visual compromise, particularly in patients with unilateral glaucoma, corneal opacification, and/or anisometropia. The clinician should treat amblyopia aggressively, addressing conditions contributing to its development, such as refractive error, strabismus, cataract, and corneal clouding. Elevated IOP can lead to buphthalmos in patients with PCG and to progressive myopia and anisometropia in patients with JOAG. Haab striae and corneal scarring may cause astigmatism. Refractive errors should be corrected with spectacles, and use of protective eyewear should be encouraged.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Strabismus may result from glaucoma tube shunts or amblyopia. When performing surgery to correct strabismus, the surgeon should try to minimize conjunctival scarring in anticipation of future glaucoma surgeries and should be cognizant of the sites of prior trabeculectomies and glaucoma tube shunt implants.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All cases of pediatric glaucoma require lifelong follow-&#173;up to monitor IOP, potential complications from prior surgeries, and secondary vision-&#173;threatening issues. Because relapses of glaucoma may occur even years later, glaucoma specialists and pediatric specialists should coordinate care. Educating parents about the need for lifelong care of the child with glaucoma and involving these children in their own care enhance the long-term management of this challenging disease.</p>
