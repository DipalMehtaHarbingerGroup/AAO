			<p class="chapter-title">Intraocular Pressure and Aqueous Humor Dynamics</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An understanding of <span class="italic">aqueous humor dynamics</span> is essential for the evaluation and management of glaucoma. As shown in Figure&#160;1-2 in Chapter&#160;1, aqueous humor (aqueous) is produced in the posterior chamber and flows through the pupil into the anterior chamber. Aqueous humor exits the eye by passing through the <span class="italic">trabecular meshwork</span> and into the <span class="italic">Schlemm canal</span> before draining into the venous system through a plexus of collector channels. Some aqueous exits the eye via the uveoscleral pathway, which is proposed to pass through the root of the iris and the ciliary body face, into the suprachoroidal space. The proportion of aqueous flowing through the trabecular pathway versus the uveoscleral pathway varies as a result of multiple factors. The modified <span class="italic">Goldmann equation</span> summarizes the relationship between many of these factors and the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the undisturbed eye:</p>

			<p class="h1">Aqueous Humor Production and Composition</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Aqueous humor is produced by the ciliary processes at an average rate of 2–3&#160;µL/min. The ciliary body contains approximately 80&#160;ciliary processes, each of which is composed of a double layer of epithelium over a core of stroma and a rich supply of fenestrated capillaries (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-2</span>). These capillaries are supplied mainly by branches of the major arterial circle of the iris. The apical surfaces of both the outer pigmented and the inner nonpigmented layers of epithelium face each other and are joined by tight junctions, which are an important component of the blood–aqueous barrier. The inner nonpigmented epithelial cells, which protrude into the posterior chamber, contain numerous mitochondria and microvilli; these cells are thought to be the actual site of aqueous production. The ciliary processes provide a large surface area for secretion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aqueous humor enters the posterior chamber via the following physiologic mechanisms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-1">active secretion, which takes place in the double-layered ciliary epithelium</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">ultrafiltration</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-2">simple diffusion</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Active secretion</span> refers to transport that requires energy to move sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and other ions, which are currently unknown, against an electrochemical gradient. Active secretion is independent of pressure and accounts for the majority of aqueous production. It involves, at least in part, activity of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase&#160;II. <span class="italic">Ultrafiltration</span> refers to a pressure-&#173;dependent movement along a pressure gradient. In the ciliary processes, the hydrostatic pressure difference between capillary pressure and IOP favors fluid movement into the eye, whereas the oncotic gradient between the two resists fluid movement. The relationship between secretion and ultrafiltration is not known. <span class="italic">Diffusion</span> involves the passive movement of ions, based on charge and concentration, across a membrane.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In humans, aqueous humor has an excess of hydrogen and chloride ions, an excess of ascorbate, and a deficit of bicarbonate relative to plasma. Aqueous humor is essentially protein free (1/200–1/500 of the protein found in plasma), allowing for optical clarity and reflecting the integrity of the blood–aqueous barrier of the normal eye. Albumin accounts for approximately half of the total protein. Other components of aqueous humor include growth factors; several enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase, lysozyme, diamine oxidase, plasminogen activator, dopamine <span class="greek--tx-">b</span>-hydroxylase, and phospholipase&#160;A<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>; and prostaglandins, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, catecholamines, steroid hormones, and hyaluronic acid. Aqueous humor composition is altered as it flows from the posterior chamber, through the pupil, and into the anterior chamber. This alteration occurs across the hyaloid face of the vitreous, the surface of the lens, the blood vessels of the iris, and the corneal endothelium; and it is secondary to other dilutional exchanges and active processes. See BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology,</span> for further discussion of aqueous humor composition and production.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-3">Suppression of Aqueous Formation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Various classes of drugs can suppress aqueous formation. The mechanisms of action of these drugs are discussed in Chapter&#160;7.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Inhibition of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase suppresses aqueous humor formation. However, the precise role of carbonic anhydrase has been debated vigorously. Its function may be to provide the bicarbonate ion, which, evidence suggests, is actively secreted in human eyes. Carbonic anhydrase may also provide bicarbonate or hydrogen ions for an intracellular buffering system.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Aqueous humor formation may be reduced by the blockade of <span class="greek--tx-">b</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>-receptors, which are the most prevalent adrenergic receptors in the ciliary epithelium and which may affect active secretion by causing a decrease either in the efficiency of Na<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>,K<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">+</span>-ATPase or in the number of pump sites. For additional discussion of the sodium pump and the pump–leak mechanism, see BCSC Section&#160;2, <span class="italic">Fundamentals and Principles of Ophthalmology. </span><span class="italic CharOverride-1">Stimulation of </span><span class="greek--tx-">a</span><span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span><span class="italic CharOverride-1">-receptors also reduces aqueous humor formation, possibly via a reduction of ciliary body blood flow mediated through inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); the exact mechanism is unclear.</span></p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Measurement of Aqueous Formation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most common method used to measure the rate of aqueous formation is <span class="italic">fluorophotometry.</span> For this test, fluorescein is administered systemically or topically, its gradual dilution in the anterior chamber is measured optically, and change in fluorescein concentration over time is then used to calculate aqueous flow. As previously noted, the normal flow is approximately 2–3&#160;µL/min, and the aqueous volume is turned over at a rate of approximately 1% per minute. The measurement of aqueous humor flow rate is assumed to be equal to the rate of aqueous production by the ciliary processes at steady state.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The rate of aqueous humor formation varies diurnally and decreases by half during sleep. It also decreases with age. The rate of aqueous formation is affected by a variety of factors, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-1">integrity of the blood–aqueous barrier</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">blood flow to the ciliary body</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-2">neurohumoral regulation of vascular tissue and the ciliary epithelium</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Aqueous humor production may decrease after trauma or intraocular inflammation and after the administration of certain drugs (eg, general anesthetics and some systemic hypotensive agents). Carotid occlusive disease may also decrease aqueous humor production.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-6">Aqueous Humor Outflow</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Aqueous humor outflow occurs by 2&#160;major mechanisms: pressure-&#173;sensitive trabecular outflow and pressure-&#173;insensitive uveoscleral outflow.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Trabecular Outflow</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The trabecular meshwork is classically divided into 3&#160;layers: uveal, corneoscleral, and juxtacanalicular (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-3</span>). The <span class="italic">uveal trabecular meshwork</span> is adjacent to the anterior chamber and is arranged in bands that extend from the iris root and the ciliary body to the peripheral cornea. The <span class="italic">corneoscleral meshwork</span> consists of sheets of trabeculum that extend from the scleral spur to the lateral wall of the scleral sulcus. The <span class="italic">juxtacanalicular meshwork,</span> which is thought to be the major site of outflow resistance, is adjacent to and actually forms the inner wall of the Schlemm canal. Aqueous moves both across and between the endothelial cells lining the inner wall of the Schlemm canal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The trabecular meshwork is composed of multiple layers, each of which consists of a collagenous connective tissue core covered by a continuous endothelial layer. The trabecular meshwork is the site of pressure-&#173;sensitive outflow and functions as a one-way valve, permitting aqueous to leave the eye by bulk flow but limiting flow in the other direction, independent of energy. Its cells are phagocytic, and they may exhibit this function in the presence of inflammation and after laser trabeculoplasty.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In most eyes of older adults, trabecular cells contain a large number of pigment granules within their cytoplasm that give the entire meshwork a brown or muddy appearance. There are relatively few trabecular cells—approximately 200,000–300,000&#160;cells per eye. With age, the number of trabecular cells decreases, and the basement membrane beneath them thickens, potentially increasing outflow resistance. An interesting effect of all types of laser trabeculoplasty is that it induces division of trabecular cells and causes a change in the production of cytokines and other structurally important elements of the extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix material is found through the dense portions of the trabecular meshwork.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">Schlemm canal</span> is completely lined with an endothelial layer that rests on a discontinuous basement membrane. The canal is a single channel, typically with a diameter of about 200–300&#160;µm, although there is significant variability; it is traversed by tubules. The exact path of aqueous flow across the inner wall of the Schlemm canal is uncertain. Intracellular and intercellular pores suggest bulk flow, while so-called giant vacuoles that have direct communication with the intertrabecular spaces suggest active transport but may be artifacts. The outer wall of the Schlemm canal is formed by a single layer of endothelial cells that do not contain pores. A complex system of vessels connects the Schlemm canal to the episcleral veins, which subsequently drain into the anterior ciliary and superior ophthalmic veins. These, in turn, ultimately drain into the cavernous sinus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The trabecular outflow pathway is dynamic. With increasing IOP, the cross-&#173;sectional area of the Schlemm canal decreases, while the trabecular meshwork expands. The effect of these changes on outflow resistance is unclear.</p>
			<p class="h2">Measurement of Outflow Facility</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The facility of outflow (<span class="italic">C</span>&#160;in the Goldmann equation; see the beginning of the chapter) is the mathematical inverse of outflow resistance and varies widely in normal eyes, with mean value ranging from 0.22 to 0.30&#160;µL/min/mm&#160;Hg. Outflow facility decreases with age and is affected by surgery, trauma, medications, and endocrine factors. Patients with glaucoma and elevated IOP typically have decreased outflow facility.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Tonography is a method used to measure the facility of aqueous outflow. With this technique, a weighted Schiøtz tonometer or pneumatonometer is placed on the cornea, acutely elevating the IOP. Outflow facility in µL/min/mm&#160;Hg can be computed from the rate at which the pressure declines with time, reflecting the ease with which aqueous leaves the eye.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Unfortunately, tonography depends on a number of assumptions (eg, ocular rigidity, stability of aqueous formation, and constancy of ocular blood volume) and is subject to many sources of error, such as patient fixation and eyelid squeezing. These problems reduce the accuracy and reproducibility of tonography for an individual patient. In general, tonography is best used as a research tool for investigating mechanisms of action of IOP changes and is rarely used clinically.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-7">Uveoscleral Outflow</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the normal eye, any nontrabecular outflow is termed <span class="italic">uveoscleral outflow.</span> Uveoscleral outflow is also referred to as <span class="italic">pressure-&#173;insensitive outflow.</span> A variety of mechanisms are likely involved, but the predominant one is aqueous passage from the anterior chamber into the ciliary muscle and then into the supraciliary and suprachoroidal spaces. The fluid then exits the eye through the intact sclera or along the nerves and the vessels that penetrate it. There is evidence that outflow via the uveoscleral pathway is significant in human eyes, accounting for up to 45% of total aqueous outflow. Studies indicate that uveoscleral outflow decreases with age and is reduced in patients with glaucoma. It is increased by cycloplegia, adrenergic agents, and prostaglandin analogues but decreased by miotics. It is also increased by certain complications of surgery and by cyclodialysis clefts. Uveoscleral outflow cannot be measured noninvasively and is therefore calculated from the Goldmann equation.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-10">Episcleral Venous Pressure</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Episcleral venous pressure (EVP) is relatively stable, except with alterations in body position and with certain diseases that obstruct venous return to the heart or shunt blood from the arterial to the venous system. Episcleral venous pressure is often increased in syndromes with facial hemangiomas (eg, Sturge-&#173;Weber), carotid-&#173;cavernous sinus fistulas, and cavernous sinus thrombosis, and it is partially responsible for the elevated IOP seen in thyroid eye disease. The pressure in the episcleral veins can be measured with specialized equipment. The usual range of values is 6–9&#160;mm Hg, but higher values have been reported depending on the measurement technique used. According to the Goldmann equation, IOP rises approximately 1&#160;mm Hg for every 1&#160;mm Hg increase in EVP. However, elevation of EVP may alter other parameters of aqueous humor dynamics. Abnormally elevated EVP can cause collapse of the Schlemm canal and potentially increase aqueous humor outflow resistance; elevated EVP may also alter uveoscleral outflow. As a result, the change in IOP may be greater or less than that predicted by the Goldmann equation.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-12">Intraocular Pressure</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top4">
			<p class="h2-h1">Distribution in the Population and Relation to Glaucoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pooled data from large epidemiologic studies indicate that the mean IOP in the general population of European ancestry is approximately 15.5&#160;mm Hg, with a standard deviation of 2.6&#160;mm Hg. However, IOP has a non-&#173;Gaussian distribution with a skew toward higher pressures, especially in individuals older than 40&#160;years (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-4</span>). The value 21&#160;mm Hg (&gt;2&#160;standard deviations above the mean) was traditionally used both to separate normal and abnormal pressures and to define which patients required ocular hypotensive therapy. This division was based on 2&#160;erroneous clinical assumptions, which are as follows: glaucomatous damage is caused exclusively by pressures that are higher than normal; and normal pressures do not cause damage. An example of the shortcomings created by these assumptions is that screening for glaucoma based solely on IOP greater than 21&#160;mm Hg misses up to half of the people with glaucoma and optic nerve damage in the screened population.</p>
			<p class="body-text">General agreement has been reached that, for the population as a whole, there is no clear IOP level below which IOP can be considered “normal” or safe and above which IOP can be considered “elevated” or unsafe. In some eyes, damage occurs with IOP levels of 18&#160;mm Hg or lower, whereas in other eyes, IOPs of 30&#160;mm Hg or higher are tolerated. However, elevation of IOP is considered a very important risk factor for glaucoma. Although other risk factors affect an individual’s susceptibility to glaucoma, all current treatments are designed to reduce IOP.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Factors Influencing Intraocular Pressure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Intraocular pressure varies with a number of factors, including the time of day (see the subsection “Circadian variation”), body position, heartbeat, respiration, exercise, fluid intake, systemic medications, and topical medications (<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;2-1</span>). Also, IOP is genetically influenced: higher pressures are more common in relatives of patients with primary open-&#173;angle glaucoma than in the general population.</p>
			<p class="body-text">IOP is higher when an individual is recumbent rather than upright, predominantly because of an increase in the EVP. Some individuals have an exaggerated rise in IOP when recumbent; this tendency may be important in the pathogenesis of some forms of glaucoma. Alcohol consumption results in a transient decrease in IOP. In most studies, caffeine has not been shown to have an appreciable effect on IOP. Cannabis also decreases IOP but has not been proven clinically useful because of its short duration of action and poor side-&#173;effect profile. Finally, there is little variation in IOP with age in healthy individuals.</p>
			<p class="h3">Circadian variation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In individuals without glaucoma, IOP varies by 2–6&#160;mm Hg over a 24-hour period, as aqueous humor production, outflow facility, and uveoscleral outflow rate change. Higher IOP is associated with wider fluctuation in pressure. The time at which peak IOPs occur in any individual is quite variable. In many persons, peak daytime pressures are reached in the morning. However, around-the-clock IOP measurement performed with individuals in habitual body positions (standing or sitting during the daytime and supine at night) indicates that in most persons (those with glaucoma and those without) peak pressures are reached during sleep, in the early-&#173;morning hours. Measurement of IOP outside office hours may be useful for determining why optic nerve damage occurs despite apparently adequately controlled pressure. However, the impact of IOP fluctuations on the optic nerve remains unknown.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-4">Clinical Measurement of Intraocular Pressure</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Tonometry</span> is the noninvasive measurement of IOP. <span class="italic">Applanation tonometry,</span> the most widely used method, is based on the Imbert-&#173;Fick principle, which states that the pressure inside an ideal dry, thin-walled sphere equals the force necessary to flatten its surface divided by the area of the flattening:</p>
			<p class="equation-single ParaOverride-14"><span class="italic">P</span> = <span class="italic">F</span>/<span class="italic">A</span></p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">where <span class="italic">P</span> = pressure, <span class="italic">F</span> = force, and <span class="italic">A</span> = area. In applanation tonometry, the cornea is flattened, and IOP is determined by measuring the applanating force and the area flattened.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">Goldmann applanation tonometer</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-5</span>) measures the force necessary to flatten an area of the cornea of 3.06&#160;mm in diameter. At this diameter, the material resistance of the cornea to flattening is counterbalanced by the capillary attraction of the tear film meniscus to the tonometer head. Furthermore, the IOP (in mm&#160;Hg) equals the flattening force (in grams-force) multiplied by 10. A split-&#173;image prism allows the examiner to determine the flattened area with great accuracy. To outline the area of flattening, topical anesthetic and fluorescein dye are instilled in the tear film. Fluorescein semicircles, or <span class="italic">mires,</span> visible through the split-&#173;image prism move with the ocular pulse, and the endpoint is reached when the inner edges of the semicircles touch each other at the midpoint of their excursion (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;2-6</span>). By properly aligning the mires, the examiner can ensure the appropriate area of corneal applanation and obtain a correct IOP reading.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">Perkins tonometer</span> is a counterbalanced applanation tonometer that, like the Goldmann tonometer, uses a split-&#173;image prism and requires instillation of fluorescein dye in the tear film. It is portable and can be used with the patient either upright or supine.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Applanation measurements are safe, easy to perform, and relatively accurate in most clinical situations. Of the currently available devices, the Goldmann applanation tonometer is the most widely used in clinical practice and for studies. Because applanation does not displace much fluid (approximately 0.5&#160;µL) or substantially increase the pressure in the eye, IOP measurement by this method is relatively unaffected by ocular rigidity, compared with indentation tonometry.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The accuracy of applanation tonometry is reduced in certain situations, however (see <span class="xref-table">Table&#160;2-2</span>, which lists possible sources of error in tonometry). For example, an excessive amount of fluorescein in the tear film results in wide mires and an artificially high reading, whereas an inadequate amount of fluorescein leads to artificially low readings. If the patient has marked corneal astigmatism, the fluorescein pattern seen by the clinician through the instrument ocular is elliptical and the IOP may be artificially high or low. To obtain an accurate reading, the clinician should rotate the prism so that the red mark on the prism holder is set at the least-curved meridian of the cornea (along the negative axis). Alternatively, 2&#160;pressure readings taken 90° apart can be averaged. Corneal edema predisposes to falsely low readings, whereas pressure measurements taken over a corneal scar will be falsely high. Tonometry performed over a soft contact lens gives falsely low values. Central corneal thickness is another factor that can affect the accuracy of tonometry; see the following subsection.</p>
			<p class="h3">Tonometry and central corneal thickness</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Measurements obtained with the most common types of tonometers are affected by central corneal thickness (CCT). Measurement with the Goldmann tonometer is most accurate when the CCT is 520&#160;µm. Thicker corneas resist the deformation inherent in most methods of tonometry, resulting in an overestimation of IOP, while thinner corneas may give an artificially low reading. IOP measured after photorefractive keratectomy and laser in situ keratomileusis may be underestimated because of changes in corneal thickness induced by these and other refractive procedures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The relationship between measured IOP and CCT is not linear, so any correction factors are only estimates at best. In addition, the biomechanical properties of individual corneas may vary, and the stiffness or elasticity of the cornea may affect IOP measurement. Currently, there is no validated correction factor for the effect of CCT on applanation tonometers; therefore, clinical application of any of the correction methods proposed in the literature should be avoided. Thin CCT is a risk factor for progression from ocular hypertension to glaucoma, but whether this increased risk of glaucoma is due to underestimating actual IOP in patients with thin central corneas or whether a thin central cornea is a risk factor independent of IOP measurement has not been determined (see Chapter&#160;4).</p>

			<p class="h3">Methods other than Goldmann-type applanation tonometry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">While applanation tonometry remains the standard clinical method for measurement of IOP, numerous other methods have been developed, each with advantages and disadvantages when compared with applanation.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Mackay-Marg-type</span> tonometers use an annular ring to gently flatten a small area of the cornea. As the area of flattening increases, the pressure in the center of the ring increases as well and is measured with a transducer. The IOP is equivalent to the pressure when the center of the ring is just covered by the flattened cornea.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Portable electronic</span> devices of the Mackay-&#173;Marg type (eg, Tono-&#173;Pen, Reichert Technologies, Depew, NY) contain a strain gauge to measure the pressure at the center of an annular ring placed on the cornea. These devices are particularly useful for measuring IOP in patients with corneal scars or edema.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">pneumatic tonometer,</span> or <span class="italic">pneumatonometer,</span> is an applanation tonometer that shares some characteristics with the Mackay-&#173;Marg-type devices. It has a cylindrical air-filled chamber and a probe tip covered with a flexible, inert silicone elastomer (Silastic membrane) diaphragm. Because of the constant flow of air through the chamber, there is a small gap between the diaphragm and the probe edge. As the probe tip touches and applanates the cornea, the air pressure increases until this gap is completely closed, at which point the IOP is equivalent to the air pressure. Because this instrument covers only a small area of the cornea, it is especially useful in eyes with corneal scars or edema.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">dynamic contour tonometer,</span> a newer type of nonapplanation contact tonometer, is based on the principle that when the surface of the cornea is aligned with the surface of the instrument tip, the pressure in the tear film between these surfaces is equal to the IOP and can be measured by a pressure transducer. Evidence suggests that IOP measurements obtained with dynamic contour tonometry are more independent of corneal biomechanical properties and thickness than those obtained with older tonometers.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Noncontact (air-puff) tonometers</span> determine IOP by measuring the force of air required to indent the cornea to a fixed point, thereby avoiding contact with the eye. Readings obtained with these instruments vary widely, and IOP is often overestimated. Noncontact tonometers are often used in large-scale glaucoma-&#173;screening programs or by nonmedical health care providers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">Ocular Response Analyzer</span> (ORA; Reichert Technologies, Depew, NY) is a type of noncontact tonometer that uses correction algorithms so that its IOP readings more closely match applanation IOPs and the effect of corneal biomechanical properties on pressure measurement is reduced. In addition, indicators of ocular biomechanical properties are calculated, including corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor. Corneal hysteresis is the difference in IOP measured during the initial corneal indentation and IOP measured during corneal rebound. Reduced corneal hysteresis may be a risk factor for glaucoma.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Rebound tonometry</span> determines IOP by measuring the speed at which a small probe propelled against the cornea decelerates and rebounds after impact. Rebound tonometers are portable, and topical anesthesia is not required, making them particularly suitable for pediatric populations.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Schiøtz tonometry</span> determines IOP by measuring the amount of corneal indentation produced by a known weight. The amount of indentation is read on a linear scale on the instrument and converted to mm&#160;Hg by a calibration table. Due to a number of practical and theoretical problems, Schiøtz tonometry is now rarely used in the developed world.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is possible to estimate IOP by <span class="italic">digital pressure</span> on the globe, referred to as <span class="italic">tactile tension.</span> This test may be useful in uncooperative patients; however, the results may be inaccurate even when the test is performed by very experienced clinicians. In general, tactile tensions are useful only for detecting large differences in IOP between a patient’s two eyes.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many infectious agents—including the viruses responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, hepatitis, and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis—can be recovered from tears. Tonometers must be cleaned after each use so that the transfer of such agents can be prevented. For Goldmann-&#173;type tonometers and the Perkins tonometer, the tonometer tips (prisms) should be cleaned immediately after use. The prisms should be soaked in a 1:10 sodium hypochlorite solution (household bleach), in 3% hydrogen peroxide, or in 70% isopropyl alcohol for 5&#160;minutes and rinsed and dried before reuse. If alcohol is employed, it should be allowed to evaporate or the prism head should be dried before reuse to prevent damage to the corneal epithelium. For cleaning other tonometers, refer to the manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>
