			<p class="chapter-title">Focal and Diffuse Choroidal and Retinal Inflammation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A variety of inflammatory disorders are associated with yellow-&#173;white lesions of the ret&#173;ina and choroid. This chapter highlights vari&#173;ous focal and diffuse ret&#173;i&#173;nal and choroidal inflammatory disorders that can cause such lesions and includes epidemiology and descriptions of clinical features associated with &#173;these disorders. When the term <span class="italic">standard treatment</span> is used to describe therapy, options for inflammatory eye disease include corticosteroids in the acute phase and immunosuppressive agents for suppressive therapy. Other therapies or disease-&#173;specific treatment options are also outlined as appropriate. See BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis,</span> for more in-&#173;depth information on &#173;these disorders, further detail on treatment approaches, and additional illustrations.</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Many authorities now believe that MFC and PIC are part of a spectrum of the same condition; in this chapter, both of &#173;these entities are referred to as MFC (discussed in the section “Multifocal choroiditis”). Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR), acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN), and acute idiopathic maculopathy (AIM), also discussed in this chapter, are often included in discussions of the more classic white dot syndromes listed above &#173;because of their presumed inflammatory etiology and the frequently shared symptoms of decreased vision, scotomas, and photopsias.</p>
			<p class="h3">Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE; also known as <span class="italic">AMPPPE</span> or <span class="italic">AMPPE</span>) is an uncommon, bilateral inflammatory disorder characterized by the acute onset of blurred vision, scotomas, and, in some patients, photopsias. Approximately one-&#173;third of patients describe an antecedent flulike illness. Men and &#173;woman are affected equally; onset usually occurs in youth to &#173;middle age. Mild anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation may be pres&#173;ent. The lesions, which are typically multiple, yellow-&#173;white, placoid, and variable in size, occur at the level of the outer ret&#173;ina (ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium, RPE) and inner choroid (choriocapillaris) (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">1</span>). Recurrences are uncommon. The etiology is unknown, although the condition is characterized by hypoperfusion of the choriocapillaris that results in injury to the overlying RPE. Systemic involvement—&#173;especially ce&#173;re&#173;bral vasculitis—&#173;can occur, although it is uncommon. APMPPE-&#173;like lesions can be pres&#173;ent in patients with sarcoidosis, syphilis, and tuberculosis; therefore, testing to exclude &#173;these conditions should be considered.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Acutely, fluorescein angiography (FA) of active lesions shows early blockage followed by progressive late leakage and staining. Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography shows early and late (per&#173;sis&#173;tent) hypofluorescence, corresponding to and often extending beyond &#173;those lesions identified clinically and on FA. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) images taken through active lesions reveal dome-&#173;shaped, outer-&#173;retinal lesions that correspond with disruption of the hyperreflective bands associated with the photoreceptors and RPE. Autofluorescence in and around active lesions varies over time and may be &#173;either increased or decreased at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion; it tends to decrease as disease activity subsides. With time, hypoautofluorescence develops in areas of RPE disruption. The fundus appearance and visual symptoms typically improve within weeks. The long-&#173;term prognosis tends to be good, but severe vision loss can result from RPE and/or photoreceptor injury.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment for APMPPE is not typically indicated, although systemic corticosteroids may be considered in isolated cases with accompanying central macular involvement or ce&#173;re&#173;bral vasculitis. Severe APMPPE may be difficult to distinguish from serpiginous choroidopathy (discussed in the following section); that difficulty led to the introduction of the term <span class="italic">ampiginous</span> to characterize the APMPPE–&#173;serpiginous choroidopathy disease continuum. Other, related placoid disorders include per&#173;sis&#173;tent placoid maculopathy, which is characterized by central macular involvement, a longer healing time, and a high risk of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) formation, as well as relentless placoid chorioretinitis, which is characterized by the frequent occurrence of smaller, geo&#173;graph&#173;i&#173;cally distributed lesions that typically require immunosuppressive treatment.</p>

			<p class="h3">Serpiginous choroidopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Serpiginous choroidopathy, also known as <span class="italic">geographic choroiditis</span> or <span class="italic">helicoid peripapillary choroidopathy,</span> is an uncommon, often vision-&#173;threatening, recurring inflammatory disorder involving the outer ret&#173;ina (the RPE) and inner choroid (the choriocapillaris). Classically, lesions first appear at or near the optic nerve head and extend centrifugally in a serpentine pattern. With numerous recurrences, a serpiginous (pseudopodial) or geographic (maplike) pattern of chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal scarring develops (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">2</span>). Findings on clinical examination and through multimodal imaging of active serpiginous lesions resemble &#173;those of acute APMPPE. Lesions tend to occur near or adjacent to inactive scars from prior episodes of inflammation. Per&#173;sis&#173;tent scotomas and decreased central vision are common symptoms. Serpiginous choroidopathy tends to affect men and &#173;women equally; onset typically occurs in &#173;middle age.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In endemic areas, such as India, tuberculosis is recognized as producing serpiginous-&#173;like lesions, leading some clinicians to describe such lesions as <span class="italic">tubercular serpiginous-&#173;like <br /></span><span class="italic">choroiditis.</span> In patients with serpiginous-&#173;like lesions, evaluation for tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and syphilis should be considered. Standard autoimmune disease treatment options are typically needed to stabilize the condition and prevent recurrences.</p>

			<p class="h3">Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) is an acute-&#173;onset syndrome characterized by multiple small gray, white, or yellow-&#173;white dots at the level of the outer ret&#173;ina (RPE level) in and around the posterior pole (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">3</span>). In some patients, an unusual transient foveal granularity consisting of tiny yellow-&#173;orange flecks at the level of the RPE also develops; this is highly suggestive of the condition. Abnormalities on ICG angiography suggest simultaneous choroidal involvement. Mild anterior chamber cell reaction or vitritis may be pres&#173;ent. Affected individuals are typically young to &#173;middle aged; &#173;women are affected more often than men. Symptoms tend to be unilateral and include decreased vision, scotomas, and sometimes photopsias. Temporal visual field abnormalities and an enlarged blind spot are common, and an afferent pupillary defect is often pres&#173;ent. The etiology of MEWDS is unknown, although one-&#173;third of patients describe a flulike prodrome.</p>
			<p class="body-text">FA reveals multiple, punctate, hyperfluorescent dots associated with the spots observed clinically, typically in a wreath-&#173;like cluster. Mild, late leakage and staining of the optic nerve head is often observed. ICG angiography shows hypofluorescence around the optic nerve head as well as multiple hypofluorescent dots, which are typically more numerous than &#173;those observed &#173;either clinically or on FA. OCT images taken through active lesions reveal dome-&#173;shaped outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions associated with disruption of the outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal hyperreflective bands. Fundus autofluorescence imaging often shows focal hyperautofluorescence in the area of the white dots. On electroretinogram (ERG) testing, some patients show delayed 30-&#173;Hz flicker responses and decreased bright-&#173;flash, dark-&#173;adapted a-&#173;wave amplitudes. The symptoms and fundus findings start to improve in most patients in 2–6 weeks without treatment. In rare cases, MEWDS can be recurrent or bilateral, cause per&#173;sis&#173;tent scotomas or visual field defects, or is associated with the late development of CNV.</p>
			<p class="h3">Birdshot uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Birdshot uveitis, or <span class="italic">vitiliginous chorioretinitis,</span> is bilateral and affects &#173;women more often than men, typically in late &#173;middle age. Early symptoms include floaters and blurred or decreased vision. &#173;Later in the course of disease, nyctalopia, diminished contrast sensitivity, and decreased color vision may occur. Examination reveals vitreous inflammation, which is typically mild and is associated with multiple yellow-&#173;white choroiditis spots that are often initially observed inferior to the optic nerve head (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">4</span>). Fluorescein angiography often shows leakage from the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels and optic nerve head, frequently producing cystoid macular edema (CME). Variable amounts of outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy can also be pres&#173;ent, resulting in win&#173;dow defects. Choroidal lesions are best visualized using ICG angiography. OCT and fundus autofluorescence can be used to assess the extent of outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The disease is chronic, progressive, and prone to recurrent episodes of inflammation. Vision loss may be caused by CME, epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane formation, and/or outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy, which can be extensive and is associated with optic atrophy in advanced cases. Most patients with birdshot uveitis are white and test positive for HLA-&#173;A29 (<span class="symbol">&gt;</span> 90%); birdshot uveitis has the strongest association documented between a disease and HLA class&#160;I. Disease activity and progression may be assessed in the office using multimodal imaging (FA, ICG angiography, spectral-&#173;domain OCT, enhanced depth OCT, and fundus autofluorescence) and through periodic electrophysiologic (ERG), color vision, and visual field testing—&#173;each of which may show a degree of dysfunction far greater than that suggested by Snellen visual acuity assessments. Standard autoimmune disease treatment options are employed.</p>
			<p class="h3">Multifocal choroiditis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Use of the terms <span class="italic">idiopathic multifocal choroiditis, multifocal choroiditis with panuveitis</span> (MFCPU), <span class="italic">recurrent multifocal choroiditis</span> (RMC), <span class="italic">punctate inner choroiditis</span> or <span class="italic">choroidopathy</span> (PIC), and <span class="italic">pseudo-&#173;presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome</span> (pseudo-&#173;POHS), among &#173;others, is both inconsistent and confusing in the lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture. Current recommendations suggest that only the term <span class="italic">multifocal choroiditis</span> (MFC) should be used to refer to the occurrence of discrete chorioretinitis lesions in the absence of an identifiable under&#173;lying infection (such as tuberculosis or histoplasmosis) or systemic inflammation (such as sarcoidosis). In MFC, lesions are commonly clustered in the macula and around the optic nerve head, although they can also occur in the mid-&#173; and far periphery (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-5</span>), and are frequently aligned in a curvilinear manner—&#173;configurations that are sometimes referred to as <span class="italic">Schlaegel lines.</span> Affected individuals are typically young, myopic, and female. Clinical examination usually reveals &#173;little or no anterior chamber or vitreous inflammation, although patients can have mild to moderate vitreous inflammation—&#173;a pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion some clinicians mean when using the term <span class="italic">MFCPU.</span> Blurred or decreased vision and scotomas are the most common symptoms. Decreased central vision results most frequently from direct central macular involvement or from the development of CNV, which occurs in one-&#173;third of patients (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-6</span>). Subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis can occur in and around lesions and, when the central macula is involved, can also limit vision. Standard treatment options for autoimmune disease are employed.</p>

			<p class="h3">Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR), a presumed inflammatory disorder, damages broad zones of the outer ret&#173;ina in 1 or both eyes. AZOOR typically occurs in young &#173;women with myopia, and onset is acute and unilateral. Three-&#173;fourths of cases pro&#173;gress to bilateral involvement. Initial symptoms include photopsia, nasal visual field loss, and sometimes an enlarged blind spot; visual acuity is affected in rare instances. On initial pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, the fundus may appear normal or show evidence of mild vitritis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-&#173;</span><span class="xref-figure">7</span>). Nearly 25% of patients have an afferent pupillary defect. Angiographic findings may include ret&#173;i&#173;nal and optic nerve head capillary leakage, especially in patients with evidence of vitritis. On ERG, a delayed 30-&#173;Hz flicker response is common; multifocal ERG (mfERG) shows decreased responses in areas of the visual field defect. Visual field testing may show scotomas, which can enlarge over weeks or months.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some patients recover from AZOOR, whereas &#173;others have per&#173;sis&#173;tent, large visual field defects, which tend to stabilize over 6 months. Permanent visual field loss is often associated with late development of fundus changes. Depigmentation of large zones of RPE usually corresponds to scotomas (see <span class="xref-figure-local">Fig 11-7</span>); narrowed ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels may be vis&#173;i&#173;ble within &#173;these areas. In some patients, the late fundus appearance may resemble cancer-&#173;associated retinopathy or retinitis pigmentosa. FA images tend to appear normal early on but become abnormal in eyes with RPE alterations. ICG angiography may show areas of late hypofluorescence. OCT typically reveals outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy, including disruption of the ellipsoid zone and the outer nuclear layer in involved areas. Confocal near-&#173;infrared reflectance imaging shows hyporeflective areas that correspond to areas of lost ellipsoid zone. Autofluorescence is typically decreased in areas of involvement and is occasionally associated with &#173;either punctate or a peripheral rim of hyperautofluorescence. Immunosuppression does not alter the course of the disease.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Acute macular neuroretinopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) is a rare condition characterized by the acute onset of paracentral scotomas in 1 or both eyes in young, other&#173;wise healthy patients. &#173;Women outnumber men nearly 6 to 1&#160;in this condition. Clinically, reddish-&#173;brown teardrop or wedge-&#173;shaped lesions are observed around the fovea. The tips of &#173;these lesions point centrally; the lesions correspond in size and location to the subjective paracentral scotomas. The lesions can be difficult to see on fundus examination or with color photography but are apparent on near-&#173;infrared imaging. The ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels and optic nerve are unaffected, and &#173;there is no vitreous inflammation. High-&#173;resolution OCT is particularly helpful for visualizing the lesions and has revealed 2 patterns: (1) type 1, which is characterized by involvement of the &#173;middle ret&#173;ina or inner nuclear layer; and (2) type 2, which is characterized by involvement of the outer retina—&#173;including both the outer nuclear layer and the hyperreflective bands associated with the photoreceptors of the ellipsoid zone. Both patterns are believed to result from ischemia of the deep capillary plexus of the central ret&#173;i&#173;na.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The lesions typically resolve over several weeks to months with corresponding visual recovery; alternatively, the scotomas persist. The pathogenesis of AMN is unclear. Several associations have been noted, however, including a preceding flulike illness, the use of oral contraceptives or caffeine, and injection of adrenaline or epinephrine. Lesions resembling AMN can occur following mild to moderate, blunt, or whiplash-&#173;type trauma. &#173;Whether &#173;these lesions are AMN or traumatic maculopathy is controversial (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-8</span>).</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-5">Acute idiopathic maculopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Acute idiopathic maculopathy (AIM) is a rare disorder that pres&#173;ents with sudden, severe central or paracentral vision loss, typically in younger individuals following a flulike illness. Men and &#173;women are affected equally. Initially, only central unilateral lesions &#173;were described, but both bilateral and eccentric macular lesions have since been added to the disease spectrum. The main clinical finding is an exudative neurosensory macular detachment with &#173;little or no vitreous inflammation and variable discoloration of the under&#173;lying RPE. Mild optic nerve head swelling, ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages, vasculitis, and subret&#173;i&#173;nal infiltrates occur infrequently. Fluorescein angiography typically shows progressive irregular hyperfluorescence at the level of the RPE, followed in the late stages by pooling in the detachment space. ICG angiography shows early and per&#173;sis&#173;tent hypofluorescence. High-&#173;resolution OCT imaging documents the size and extent of the detachment space and shows loss of the hyperreflective outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal bands associated with the photoreceptors and RPE. The lesions resolve spontaneously but leave a bull’s-&#173;eye pattern of RPE alteration, which on FA shows central hypofluorescence and surrounding hyperfluorescence. &#173;There is typically near-&#173;complete recovery of vision over weeks to months. The cause is unknown, although isolated cases have been associated with coxsackievirus infection.</p>

			<p class="h2">Chorioretinal Autoimmune Conditions</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following sections detail selected autoimmune diseases that affect the ret&#173;ina and choroid. &#173;These conditions are generally treated using standard autoimmune treatment options. Specific treatment considerations are mentioned when applicable.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-7"><span class="h4-head">Beh</span><span class="h4-head_accent">ç</span><span class="h4-head">et disease</span> Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease is a complex systemic disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of inflammation and vascular occlusion involving multiple organ systems. &#173;There are no specific tests to confirm a diagnosis of Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease, but it is associated with the major histocompatibility complex HLA-&#173;B5 allele, and more specifically with HLA-&#173;B51 (the predominant split antigen). The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria (&#173;<span class="xref-table">Table&#160;11-2</span>). Recurrent oral ulceration affects nearly all patients, and cutaneous lesions such as erythema nodosum are common. Central ner&#173;vous system involvement may develop in more than 50% of patients and should be suspected in any patient with neurologic signs. Other systemic manifestations include arthritis, epididymitis, and intestinal ulcers. Beh<span class="accent">ç</span>et disease tends to affect men more than &#173;women and is particularly common in Japan, Southeast Asia, the &#173;Middle East, and the Mediterranean region. The etiology is unknown.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Uveitis is common in patients with this disorder; it may be anterior, posterior, or diffuse (panuveitis). Posterior segment involvement may include vitritis, an occlusive ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, intraret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages, macular edema, focal areas of ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis, and ischemic optic neuropathy. Recurring episodes of ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis may lead to severe ischemia and ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization, which should be treated with panret&#173;i&#173;nal photocoagulation. Despite treatment, the visual prognosis is often poor &#173;because of progressive ret&#173;i&#173;nal ischemia from recurring episodes of occlusive vasculitis. Use of biologic agents, such as inhibitors of tumor necrosis &#173;factor alpha, as well as interferon, has shown promise. Treatment with azathioprine and cyclosporine has been shown to reduce ocular manifestations in well-&#173;designed prospective &#173;trials.</p>

			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-8"><span class="h4-head">Lupus vasculitis</span> <span class="italic">Systemic lupus erythematosus</span> (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disorder that most commonly affects &#173;women of childbearing age. Black and Hispanic &#173;women are at higher risk than are white &#173;women. As a multisystem disease, SLE can involve almost &#173;every ocular and periocular structure. Approximately 3%–10% of patients with SLE have ret&#173;i&#173;nal findings ranging from asymptomatic cotton-&#173;wool spots and intraret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages to macular infarction with severe central vision loss (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">9</span>). Lupus choroidopathy is less common and pres&#173;ents as multifocal serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments. The ret&#173;i&#173;nal and choroidal pathology is vascular and thought to be autoimmune in nature.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The presence of ret&#173;i&#173;nal vascular occlusion, including cotton-&#173;wool spots, is indicative of active systemic inflammation and should prompt treatment. Sarcoidosis can cause ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">10</span>) and should be evaluated as a pos&#173;si&#173;ble alternative.</p>
			<p class="h3">Intermediate uveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group defined intermediate uveitis as a subset of posterior uveitis where the vitreous is the major site of inflammation. Eighty &#173;percent of intermediate uveitis cases are idiopathic. The most commonly identified &#173;causes in North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca and Eu&#173;rope are sarcoidosis and multiple sclerosis. The diagnostic term <span class="italic">pars planitis</span> should be used only for the subset of intermediate uveitis where a “snowbank” or “snowball” formation occurs in the absence of an associated systemic disease or infection.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intermediate uveitis is typically bilateral and can occur in &#173;children, adolescents, or adults. Common symptoms include floaters and decreased vision. Characteristic ocular manifestations include vitreous inflammation, inflammatory debris overlying the pars plana (snowbanks), and aggregates of vitreous cells (snowballs). Both snowbanks and snowballs are most often observed inferiorly. Peripheral neovascularization may form along the inferior snowbank in 5%–10% of cases and can lead to vitreous hemorrhage with tractional or rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. When active, segmental phlebitis, optic nerve head leakage, and CME are common. Epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane formation also occurs.</p>

			<p class="h3">Vogt-&#173;Koyanagi-&#173;Harada disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vogt-&#173;Koyanagi-&#173;Harada (VKH) disease (or syndrome) is a systemic autoimmune disorder in which T lymphocytes are directed against melanocytes in the eye, auditory system, meninges, and skin. VKH disease most commonly affects &#173;people of Asian, American Indian, Asian Indian, Mediterranean, and &#173;Middle Eastern descent. Ocular findings are typically bilateral and include vitreous inflammation associated with serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Optic nerve head hyperemia and edema are common. Fluorescein angiography studies can be particularly helpful in monitoring disease activity and often show multiple RPE leaks in the areas of detachment, a finding referred to as the “starry night” or “Milky Way” sign. A “sunset glow” fundus appearance can be seen due to choroidal depigmentation as the uveitis subsides (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">11</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">A diagnosis of VKH disease should only be made in patients who have not had a penetrating ocular injury or ocular surgery in &#173;either eye, to help distinguish this disease from sympathetic ophthalmia. VKH disease is termed <span class="italic">probable</span> when characteristic ocular inflammation occurs in the absence of skin or neurologic findings; it is termed <span class="italic">incomplete</span> if &#173;either skin or neurologic findings, but not both, are pres&#173;ent; and it is termed <span class="italic">complete</span> when both skin and neurologic findings develop.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The clinical course of VKH disease can be divided into 3 phases:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first">1.&#9;<span class="italic">prodromal phase:</span> characterized by a flulike illness with symptoms that can include headache, meningismus, tinnitus, and dysacusis</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;<span class="italic">acute uveitic phase:</span> closely follows the prodromal phase; characterized by pain, photophobia, and vision loss accompanied by the onset of bilateral panuveitis with serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">3.&#9;<span class="italic">chronic (convalescent) phase:</span> the uveitis subsides, but depigmentation of the skin and uvea can occur; ocular depigmentation may develop at the limbus (“Sugiura” sign), the trabecular meshwork (“Ohno” sign), or within the choroid (“sunset glow” sign)</p>
			<p class="body-text">VKH disease tends to respond to standard treatments. A delay in diagnosis and treatment is associated with an increased risk of depigmentation of the skin and eye and with an increased rate of ocular complications, including cataract, glaucoma, and subret&#173;i&#173;nal fibrosis.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Sympathetic Ophthalmia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sympathetic ophthalmia, a rare condition that occurs &#173;after a penetrating ocular injury or ocular surgery, is caused by exposure of the immune system to sequestered uveal antigens. Its ocular findings are clinically and histologically indistinguishable from &#173;those in VKH disease. Inflammation of the exciting (injured or operated) and sympathizing (fellow) eye may occur days to de&#173;cades &#173;after the initial insult. As in VKH disease, the inflammation is bilateral and is characterized by the presence of panuveitis, often associated with areas of serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment and focal choroiditis (nummular chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions). Nonocular complications, such as vitiligo or poliosis, can occur but are much less common&#160;than in VKH disease. Moreover, in the rare instances when sympathetic ophthalmia does follow &#173;either injury or surgery, standard treatments almost always control the inflammation. Therefore, enucleation or evisceration of an injured eye to minimize risk of sympathetic ophthalmia should be undertaken only when the eye is painful, structurally disor&#173;ga&#173;nized, and has no light perception. Optimally, the enucleation should occur within 14 days of the trauma; it is thought immune activation against otherwise sequestered antigens in the eye does not occur until later. However, this 14-day timeline is becoming increasingly controversial.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-9">Uveitis Masquerade: Intraocular Lymphoma</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Primary vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal lymphoma</span> was previously referred to as <span class="italic">reticulum cell sarcoma, his</span><span class="italic">tiocytic lymphoma,</span> and <span class="italic">non-&#173;Hodgkin lymphoma of the central ner&#173;vous system.</span> Most cases are aggressive large B-&#173;cell tumors. Half of all cases of primary vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal lymphoma occur in patients older than 60&#160;years. Most patients with primary vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal lymphoma &#173;will develop central ner&#173;vous system (CNS) involvement. Conversely, of patients who pres&#173;ent with CNS involvement, approximately 20% &#173;will have intraocular involvement. HIV infection is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma that ranges from 50-&#173;fold (with potent antiretroviral therapy) to more than 500-&#173;fold (prior to—or without access &#173;to—&#173;potent antiretroviral therapy). Clinical features that are suggestive of lymphoma include an incomplete or transient response to corticosteroid treatment, the presence of aty&#173;pi&#173;cal vitreous cells, which &#173;may be uncharacteristically white and/or align in sheets, and the presence of subret&#173;i&#173;nal infiltrates, which may be transient and/or shift location over time (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">12</span>). Optic nerve head edema and serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment can also occur. Patients with suspected primary vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal lymphoma should undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast as well as a spinal tap for cytologic studies to evaluate for CNS involvement. A confirmatory CNS or vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal biopsy is usually performed. It is notoriously difficult to arrive at a diagnosis based on tests of a vitreous specimen &#173;because of the low cell concentrations and the propensity of lymphoma cells to undergo autolysis. &#173;Because corticosteroids &#173;will also reduce cell count, it is best to stop any corticosteroid treatments for a period of weeks before a planned biopsy. Best results are achieved with rapid test pro&#173;cessing and analy&#173;sis by cytology, immunoglobulin or T-&#173;cell receptor gene rearrangement studies, flow cytometry, and cytokine analyses. Current management practices involve both chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Intravitreal injection of methotrexate and rituximab can be effective at controlling intraocular disease, but the recurrence rate is high and long-&#173;term prognosis guarded.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In contrast, <span class="italic">uveal lymphoma</span> is usually more indolent and is associated with systemic lymphoma in up to one-&#173;third of cases. Characteristic clinical findings include uveal thickening, which often produces a birdshot uveitis–&#173;like fundus appearance, with or without serous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-13</span>). Episcleral involvement may manifest anteriorly as salmon-&#173;colored conjunctival infiltration or posteriorly as a juxtascleral mass on ultrasound. Biopsy of affected tissues can confirm the diagnosis. Evaluation for systemic involvement includes use of computed tomography (CT) or combined CT and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis.</p>

			<p class="h1">Infectious Retinal and Choroidal Inflammation</p>
			<div id="Chapt11_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The following sections briefly describe selected infectious diseases that can cause ret&#173;i&#173;nal and choroidal inflammation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Cytomegalovirus Retinitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Cytomegalovirus</span> (CMV) <span class="italic">retinitis</span> is the most common infectious congenital syndrome worldwide and can result in congenital CMV retinitis (see BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> Chapter&#160;28 for more in-&#173;depth information on this disorder). CMV retinitis is also the most common ocular opportunistic infection in adult patients with advanced AIDS and usually occurs when CD4<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> T-&#173;cell counts are less than 50/µL. Patients with CMV retinitis typically pres&#173;ent with floaters or decreased visual acuity. Clinically, CMV retinitis has a characteristic appearance that consists of opacification of the necrotic ret&#173;ina, typically along ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels and often with areas of hemorrhage. Periphlebitis and even “frosted branch” angiitis may be prominent features. The degree of vitreous inflammation is highly variable. Early CMV retinitis may resemble the cotton-&#173;wool spots associated with HIV-&#173;related retinopathy. Although the diagnosis is often made clinically, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–&#173;based analy&#173;sis of ocular fluids may be diagnostic in unclear cases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CMV retinitis can be treated with ganciclovir or foscarnet, administered systemically or intravitreally. High-&#173;dose induction therapy is typically given for 2–3 weeks, &#173;after which maintenance therapy is continued &#173;until immune reconstitution results in restoration of anti-&#173;CMV T-&#173;cell immunity—&#173;usually at CD4<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> T-&#173;cell counts greater than 200/µL. Immune recovery uveitis and its complications, most notably CME and epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane formation, occurs in approximately 20% of HIV-&#173;seropositive patients following immune reconstitution. Up to 50% of eyes with CMV retinitis eventually develop a rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">CMV retinitis can occur in the absence of HIV infection. This scenario is uncommon, however, and is almost always associated with relative immune suppression, such as that which occurs with use of systemic corticosteroids, noncorticosteroid immunosuppressive agents, or chemotherapeutics.</p>

			<p class="h2">Non-&#173;CMV Necrotizing Herpetic Retinitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Both varicella-&#173;zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) can cause necrotizing retinitis in patients, &#173;whether immunocompromised or not. Unlike CMV, &#173;these infections can pro&#173;gress rapidly and therefore should be treated aggressively. Two distinct clinical syndromes have been described: (1) <span class="italic">acute ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis</span> (ARN) syndrome and (2) <span class="italic">progressive outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal necrosis</span> (PORN) syndrome. Characteristic features of ARN include the presence of 1—or more typically, multiple—&#173;foci of retinitis, which usually occur in the periphery and are associated with occlusive ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis and moderate to severe anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">14</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">PORN occurs in patients who are severely immunocompromised, usually as the result of AIDS, and consists of rapidly progressive, multifocal necrotizing retinitis with &#173;little or no anterior chamber or vitreous inflammation. Initial involvement of the peripheral ret&#173;ina is most common, with rapid progression and coalescence of lesions (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-15</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Evaluation for &#173;these infections should include serologic testing for syphilis as well as intraocular fluid aspiration for use in PCR analy&#173;sis in order to identify DNA from VZV, HSV, CMV, and <span class="italic">Toxoplasma gondii.</span> &#173;Because ARN and PORN pro&#173;gress rapidly, treatment should commence immediately upon suspicion of &#173;either. Some specialists initiate therapy with intraocular injection of ganciclovir or foscarnet, particularly when the macula or optic nerve is threatened. High-&#173;dose antiviral therapy, using &#173;either intravenous acyclovir or oral valacyclovir (2 grams three times daily) for a minimum of 7 days, should be administered. Thereafter, immunocompetent patients should be treated with oral suppressive therapy; treatment duration can vary from several months to long-&#173;term, even lifelong treatment. Patients with HIV/AIDS should be treated at least &#173;until the CD4<span class="superscript CharOverride-1">+</span> cell count exceeds 200/µL, or perhaps in&#173;def&#173;initely (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-table">3</span>). Once antiviral therapy is initiated, systemic corticosteroids can be added in nonimmunocompromised patients and then tapered over 3–6 weeks.</p>

			<p class="h2">Endogenous Bacterial Endophthalmitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis results from hematogenous seeding of the eye, typically during transient bacteremia. Although decreased vision and eye pain are common symptoms, many patients do not have any constitutional symptoms. A wide range of bacteria can cause endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis. In North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca, 40% of cases occur in patients with endocarditis, most typically caused by &#173;either <span class="italic">Staphylococcus</span> or <span class="italic">Streptococcus</span> species. In contrast, 60% of endogenous endophthalmitis cases in Asia occur in patients with liver abscesses caused by <span class="italic">Klebsiella pneumoniae.</span> Nearly one-&#173;third of cases occur in patients who have urinary tract infections, most often caused by <span class="italic">Escherichia coli.</span> Other cases can be associated with intravenous drug use or with procedures known to produce bacteremia, particularly placement of indwelling catheters.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion can vary and depends on both the size of the inoculum and the virulence of the organism; it ranges from a focal chorioretinitis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">16</span>) with &#173;little vitreous inflammation to a dense panophthalmitis that obscures the view of the posterior segment. The patient should undergo systemic evaluation for the source of infection and initiate treatment with systemic antibiotics. Additionally, intravitreal injection of broad-&#173;spectrum antibiotics should be considered.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Fungal Endophthalmitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endophthalmitis caused by fungal infections may be &#173;either endogenous or exogenous. <span class="italic">Exogenous fungal endophthalmitis</span> is uncommon in North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca and Eu&#173;rope. In contrast, in tropical regions such as India, fungi account for up to one-&#173;fifth of culture-&#173;positive cases following surgery or trauma. <span class="italic">Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis</span> is rare regardless of setting and typically occurs in &#173;either severely immunocompromised patients with per&#173;sis&#173;tent fungemia or other&#173;wise healthy intravenous drug users following transient fungemia. Clinical pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion is often subacute, and the diagnosis is typically delayed for weeks. <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">17</span>) and <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> are the most commonly identified causative species. Fungal keratitis may also pro&#173;gress to endophthalmitis, most typically when caused by <span class="italic">Fusarium.</span> Treatment is frequently difficult and typically involves vitrectomy, intravitreal injection of amphotericin B (5 µg/0.1&#160;ml) and/or voriconazole (0.1&#160;mg/0.1&#160;ml), and systemic antifungal therapy. Two-&#173;thirds of patients with fungal endophthalmitis lose useful vision.</p>

			<p class="h3">Yeast <span class="h3--emph-">(Candida)</span> endophthalmitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endogenous yeast endophthalmitis is most frequently caused by <span class="italic">Candida</span> species. Affected patients frequently have previously used indwelling catheters or have under&#173;gone long-&#173;term antibiotic treatment or immunosuppressive therapy. Many also have a history of hyperalimentation, recent abdominal surgery, or diabetes mellitus. The initial intraocular inflammation is usually mild to moderate, and yellow-&#173;white choroidal or chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions may be single or multiple (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">18</span>). Subret&#173;i&#173;nal infiltrates may coalesce into a mushroom-&#173;shaped white nodule that proj&#173;ects through the ret&#173;ina into the vitreous. Exogenous <span class="italic">Candida</span> endophthalmitis is rare.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The diagnosis of <span class="italic">Candida</span> endophthalmitis is usually made according to the history, clinical setting, and presence of characteristic fundus features. Intraocular culture specimens are best obtained during pars plana vitrectomy, &#173;because it is difficult to culture the localized vitreous clusters of fungus from specimens taken via diagnostic vitreous tap. &#173;After completion of the vitrectomy, intravitreal injection of amphotericin B or voriconazole at standard doses is usually performed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ophthalmologist should seek consultation with a specialist in infectious diseases to evaluate the patient for systemic disease and assist with treatment planning. If the macula is not involved, visual prognosis &#173;after treatment is generally good. Focal chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal lesions are often successfully treated with systemic medi&#173;cations alone. Intravenous fluconazole and voriconazole penetrate the eye well and have been used to treat focal lesions.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-10">Tuberculosis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Even though one-&#173;third of the world’s population has been exposed to <span class="italic">Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</span> active <span class="italic">M tuberculosis</span> uveitis is uncommon, even in endemic areas. Suggestive clinical findings include solitary (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">19</span>) or multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous-&#173;like chorioretinitis, and Eales disease–&#173;like peripheral nonperfusion in association with uveitis. Patients suspected of having tuberculous uveitis should undergo testing for prior <span class="italic">M tuberculosis</span> exposure, including a chest X-&#173;ray and &#173;either purified protein derivative (PPD) skin testing or a blood-&#173;based interferon-&#173;gamma release assay.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Once the diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis is &#173;either confirmed or strongly suggested, the patient should be treated for extrapulmonary tuberculosis as recommended by &#173;either the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the World Health Organ&#173;ization.</p>

			<p class="h2">Syphilitic Chorioretinitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Uveitis is often the presenting sign of syphilis but can occur at any stage of the infection. Syphilitic uveitis is confirmed through serologic testing with both the specific and sensitive fluo&#173;rescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-&#173;ABS) test and the nonspecific VDRL or rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests, which are complementary to each other. Additional confirmatory tests include the <span class="italic">Treponema pallidum</span> particle agglutination assay (TP-&#173;PA) and the microhemagglutination assay for <span class="italic">T pallidum</span> antibodies (MHA-&#173;TP). Patients with uveitis who test positive for syphilis on serologic tests should also have their cerebrospinal fluid anti–&#173;treponemal antibody titers mea&#173;sured before and, when pres&#173;ent, &#173;after completion of therapy to document a complete response to treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many patients with syphilitic uveitis pres&#173;ent with a nondescript panuveitis, which supports the need for routine syphilis testing in all sexually active adults with uveitis. Specifically suggestive clinical findings include inflammatory ocular hypertensive syndrome, iris roseola, and retinochoroiditis. The retinochoroiditis is often diaphanous—&#173;appearing less opaque than &#173;either herpetic or toxoplasmic necrotizing retinitis—&#173;and is accompanied by overlying inflammatory accumulations termed <span class="italic">ret&#173;i&#173;nal precipitates.</span> A distinctive form of syphilitic outer retinitis termed <span class="italic">acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis</span> (ASPPC) is characterized by the presence of a placoid, round or oval, yellow-&#173;white lesion that involves or is near the macula (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-20</span>). &#173;Because coinfection is common, all patients with syphilis should be tested for HIV. Patients with syphilitic uveitis should be treated for neurosyphilis.</p>

			<p class="h2">Cat-&#173;Scratch Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Cat-&#173;scratch disease is associated with 2 ocular syndromes: (1) Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome, which consists of conjunctival inflammation with preauricular adenopathy, and (2) Leber stellate neuroretinitis, which includes macular star formation and optic nerve head swelling, often associated with a peripapillary serous macular detachment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">21</span>). Small, focal areas of retinitis or chorioretinitis occur frequently in patients with neuroretinitis. In rare cases, an optic nerve head angiomatous lesion can develop. Immunocompetent adults with cat-&#173;scratch disease are treated with doxycycline, 100&#160;mg twice daily for 4–6 weeks. Oral erythromycin can be used in &#173;children. Prolonged treatment with doxycycline and rifampin can be used in immunocompromised adults or in patients with per&#173;sis&#173;tent infection.</p>
			<p class="h2">Toxoplasmic Retinochoroiditis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis is the most common cause of posterior segment infection worldwide. The causative organism, <span class="italic">Toxoplasma gondii,</span> is an obligate, intracellular parasitic protozoan. &#173;Because seropositivity for <span class="italic">T gondii</span> is very common, seropositivity alone does not confirm that uveitis is related to toxoplasmosis. Congenital disease occurs via acquisition of the organism by a pregnant &#173;woman exposed to tissue cysts or oocytes in uncooked meat or substances contaminated with cat feces (see also BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> Chapter&#160;28). The typical ocular finding in congenital toxoplasmosis is a chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal scar, usually in the macula and often bilateral. Most cases of toxoplasmosis are currently assumed to be acquired postnatally, although proving this assumption can be difficult. A positive serologic test result for immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti–&#173;<span class="italic">T gondii</span> antibodies supports the diagnosis of an acquired disease.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Decreased vision and floaters are the most common presenting symptoms of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. Clinically, the disorder consists of a focal area of intense, necrotizing retinochoroiditis, typically with moderate to severe overlying vitreous inflammation (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11-22</span>). Recurring disease is indicated by an adjacent or nearby retinochoroidal scar. Multiple active lesions are rare and should prompt HIV testing. HIV-&#173;seropositive patients with ocular toxoplasmosis have a high risk of CNS involvement and therefore should undergo magnetic resonance imaging with contrast. El&#173;derly patients may pres&#173;ent with more aggressive disease due to their relative immunosuppression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Active ocular toxoplasmosis is commonly treated with antibiotics, despite the lack of well-&#173;designed randomized controlled &#173;trials. The simplest approach is treatment with trimethoprim-&#173;sulfamethoxazole. Classic therapy uses sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine and prednisone (prescribed with folinic acid and accompanied by regular monitoring of blood cell counts); the addition of clindamycin results in so-&#173;called qua&#173;dru&#173;ple therapy. None of &#173;these approaches has been shown to be superior to another with regard to final vision outcome, lesion size, or recurrence rate. Treatment typically lasts 4–6 weeks, and complete healing of active lesions occurs over 4–6 months. When used, systemic corticosteroids should be given &#173;under antibiotic cover. Use of long-&#173;acting, depot periocular or intraocular corticosteroid injections should be avoided. Long-&#173;term, maintenance treatment with trimethoprim-&#173;sulfamethoxazole has been used to decrease the attack rate in patients experiencing frequent recurrences or in severely immunosuppressed patients.

			<p class="h2">Toxocariasis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Toxocariasis is a parasitic infection caused by 1 of 2 roundworms: <span class="italic">Toxocara canis</span> or <span class="italic">Toxocara cati</span>, which are common intestinal parasites of dogs and cats, respectively. &#173;Humans are infected following ingestion of soil or vegetables contaminated by the ova. Although ocular toxocariasis is part of a systemic infestation by the nematode, systemic manifestations such as visceral larval migrans, fever, and eosinophilia are relatively uncommon. &#173;Children and young adults are affected disproportionately. Common symptoms include decreased vision and floaters. The condition is unilateral in most cases and typically has 1&#160;of 3 pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tions: (1) a peripheral granuloma, which often produces a traction band that extends &#173;toward the macula (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">23</span>) and occasionally mimics unilateral intermediate uveitis with snowbank formation; (2) a posterior pole granuloma, which can decrease vision dramatically when the central macula is involved; or (3) a moderate to severe panuveitis that can mimic endogenous endophthalmitis. Enzyme-&#173;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analy&#173;sis of serum or intraocular fluids can help establish the diagnosis in &#173;these cases but is relatively insensitive. Vitreous inflammation, CME, and tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment are the most common &#173;causes of vision loss. Most specialists assume that the uveitis of toxocariasis represents an immune response to antigens released from a dead or &#173;dying worm. Thus, treatment typically involves use of local or systemic corticosteroids, and antihelminthic therapy has &#173;little or no therapeutic role.</p>

			<p class="h2">Lyme Disease</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete <span class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi,</span> which is transmitted to &#173;humans by ticks from animal reservoirs: primarily rodents, deer, birds, cats, and dogs. Early systemic manifestations consist of myalgias, arthralgias, fever, headache, malaise, and a characteristic skin lesion known as <span class="italic">erythema migrans</span> or a bull’s-&#173;eye rash, which consists of an annulus of erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. In &#173;later stages, as neurologic or musculoskeletal findings manifest, ocular inflammation may develop but is uncommon. Lyme disease–&#173;related ocular findings include keratitis, scleritis, and uveitis, which may include anterior chamber or vitritis inflammation, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis, papillitis, or optic neuritis. Chronic uveitis in patients who reside in or have traveled to an endemic area or who have had a recent tick bite or an erythema migrans–&#173;like skin lesion should suggest the possibility of Lyme disease. Initial serologic testing is performed using a sensitive ELISA. If an ELISA result is positive or equivocal, then separate IgM immuno&#173;blotting (if symptoms have been pres&#173;ent for fewer than 30 days) and IgG immunoblotting should be performed on the same blood sample. A diagnosis of Lyme disease is supported only when both tests are positive. The 2 tests are designed to be used together; thus, the initial ELISA test should not be skipped. Treatment for early disease consists of tetracycline, doxycycline, or penicillin. Advanced disease may require intravenous ceftriaxone or penicillin.</p>

			<p class="h2">Diffuse Unilateral Subacute Neuroretinitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN) is a rare condition that typically occurs in other&#173;wise healthy, young patients and is caused by the presence of a mobile subret&#173;i&#173;nal nematode. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of the condition can help prevent vision loss, which can be severe. The clinical findings in DUSN can be divided into acute and end-&#173;stage manifestations. In the acute phase, patients frequently have decreased visual acuity, vitritis, papillitis, and clusters of gray-&#173;white or yellow-&#173;white outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal and choroidal lesions. The clustering of the lesions is impor&#173;tant &#173;because it often helps localize the causative nematode. The degree of vision loss is often greater than might be expected from the clinical examination. Left untreated, late sequelae ultimately develop, which include optic atrophy, ret&#173;i&#173;nal arterial narrowing, and diffuse RPE disruption with severe vision loss. The late findings can be misinterpreted as unilateral retinitis pigmentosa.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The causative nematodes in DUSN have yet to be definitively established, although <span class="italic">Toxocara</span> species, <span class="italic">Baylisascaris procyonis,</span> and <span class="italic">Ancylostoma caninum</span> have all been implicated. Raccoon exposure appears to be common in patients in North Amer&#173;i&#173;ca. The characteristic lesions are believed to result from a single nematode migrating within the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space. If the nematode can be observed, which occurs in less than half of cases, it should be destroyed using &#173;laser photocoagulation. &#173;After the worm is killed, vision usually stabilizes.</p>

			<p class="h2">West Nile Virus Chorioretinitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">West Nile virus (WNV) infection is transmitted to &#173;humans by an infected mosquito of the genus <span class="italic">Culex,</span> with birds serving as the primary reservoir. &#173;Human infection is most often subclinical, although a febrile illness occurs in approximately 20% of cases. Ocular manifestations usually occur in very ill diabetic patients with encephalitis. The manifestation most typically observed is a multifocal chorioretinitis that is usually bilateral and includes lesions arranged in distinctive curvilinear clusters that often follow the course of ret&#173;i&#173;nal nerve fibers (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 11</span>-&#173;<span class="xref-figure">24</span>). Vision typically remains good &#173;unless the lesions involve the central macula.</p>

			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the virus &#173;family <span class="italic">Flaviviridae</span> and is related to yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus. Zika is primarily spread by the female <span class="italic">Aedes aegypti</span> mosquito; infection in adults is often asymptomatic or results in only mild symptoms. Infection during pregnancy, however, can result in severe microcephaly and other brain malformations in some infants. Macular and optic nerve abnormalities have been reported in some patients with ZIKV.</p>
			<p class="h2">Ebola Virus Panuveitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Ebola virus (EBOV) &#173;causes a severe and fatal hemorrhagic fever in &#173;humans; the mortality rate is as high as 90%. Among survivors, uveitis has been described; &#173;there has been 1&#160;report of severe panuveitis that occurred &#173;after the patient experienced a complete systemic recovery but still had per&#173;sis&#173;tent viral replication in the aqueous humor.</p>
			<p class="h2">Chikungunya Virus Retinitis</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a member of the <span class="italic">Alphavirus</span> genus. The most common symptoms of CHIKV infection are fever and joint pain. Several ocular findings have been reported, including retinitis and optic neuritis, but anterior uveitis may be the most common presentation.</p>
