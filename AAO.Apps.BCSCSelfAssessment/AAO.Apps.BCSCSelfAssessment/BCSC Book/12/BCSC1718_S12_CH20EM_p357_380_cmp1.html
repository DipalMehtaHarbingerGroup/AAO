			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;1.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> The vitreous attaches to the internal limiting membrane (ILM) of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal surface primarily via fibronectin and laminin. The integrin molecule has been shown to induce posterior vitreous detachment, not facilitate attachment. The connectin molecule does not appear to play a significant role in vitreoret&#173;i&#173;nal adhesion.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;2.&#9;<span class="bold">d.</span> The density and distribution of photoreceptors vary with topographic location. In the fovea, cones are predominantly red-&#173; and green-&#173;sensitive, with a density exceeding 140,000 cones/mm<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>. The foveola has no rods. The fovea contains only photoreceptors, rods and cones, and pro&#173;cesses of Müller cells. The number of cone photoreceptors decreases rapidly away from the fovea, even though 90% of cones overall reside outside the foveal region. The density of rods also decreases &#173;toward the periphery.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;3.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a rapid, noncontact, noninvasive way to image fluorophores in the ocular fundus. Excitation light is introduced to the eye, and fluorescence from intrinsic fluorophores is detected by excluding the imaging of that excitation light via the use of a barrier filter. The main source of autofluorescence from the fundus is lipofuscin in the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE). If an RPE cell dies, its contained lipofuscin goes away, resulting in a loss of autofluorescence. &#173;These areas appear dark in autofluorescence images. This princi&#173;ple can be used to monitor the absence of RPE cells in geographic atrophy, a manifestation of nonexudative age-&#173;related macular degeneration (AMD). Fundus photography is not specific for detecting RPE cell death. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a noninvasive technique that acquires volumetric angiographic information without the use of a dye, and images the individual vascular plexuses of the inner ret&#173;ina, outer ret&#173;ina, and choriocapillaris. Fluorescein angiography is an invasive diagnostic test, primarily used for imaging the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculature.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;4.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> The pattern electroretinogram (PERG) is the ret&#173;i&#173;nal response to an isoluminant alternating checkerboard stimulus presented to the macula. The stimulus is primarily alternating contrast stimulus. The responses are small, and signal averaging is needed. &#173;There are 2 main components, P50 and N95, with most subjects showing an earlier negative component, N35. N95 arises in the ret&#173;i&#173;nal ganglion cells (RGCs) and thus acts as a direct mea&#173;sure of central RGC function. The electro-&#173;oculogram (EOG) assesses the health of the RPE by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the changes in the corneo-&#173;retinal standing potential during light adaptation. The multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) can be of use in the diagnosis of macular dysfunction and in assessing the extent of central ret&#173;i&#173;nal involvement in generalized ret&#173;i&#173;nal disease by producing a topographic electroretinogram (ERG) map of central ret&#173;i&#173;nal cone-&#173;system function. The&#160;visual evoked potential (VEP), or visual evoked response (VER), is a mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the electrical signals produced in the brain in response to light stimulus, recorded at the scalp over the occipital cortex; it is a mea&#173;sure of the integrity of the afferent visual pathway.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;5.&#9;<span class="bold">b.</span> A stage 2 macular hole is a full-&#173;thickness defect mea&#173;sur&#173;ing less than 400 µm in dia&#173;meter, without a vis&#173;i&#173;ble operculum, and a per&#173;sis&#173;tent posterior hyaloid attachment at the optic nerve head. Although approximately 50% of stage 1 macular holes close spontaneously, pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade is recommended for stage 2 or greater macular holes and has a success rate of approximately 90% or greater for a recent-&#173;onset hole.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;6.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> The Pelli-&#173;Robson test mea&#173;sures contrast sensitivity using a single, large letter size (20/60 optotype), with contrast varying across groups of letters. Patients read the letters, starting with the highest contrast and continue &#173;until they are unable to read 2 or 3 letters in a single group. The subject is assigned a score based on the contrast of the last group in which 2 or 3 letters &#173;were correctly read. The Pelli-&#173;Robson score is a logarithmic mea&#173;sure of the subject’s contrast sensitivity. The anomaloscope, Farnsworth-&#173;Munsell 100-&#173;hue test, and Ishihara plates are all used to evaluate color vision, not contrast sensitivity.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;7.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> The mfERG is useful in the diagnosis of macular dysfunction and in assessing the extent of central ret&#173;i&#173;nal involvement in generalized ret&#173;i&#173;nal disease by producing a topographic ERG map of the central ret&#173;i&#173;nal cone-&#173;system function. The stimulus consists of multiple hexagons, smaller in the center than the periphery, to reflect cone photoreceptor density, each of which flashes with a pseudorandom sequence. Cross-&#173;correlation techniques are used to calculate the small ERGs corresponding to each hexagon. Overall stimulus field size is approximately 50°. The EOG assesses the health of the RPE by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the changes in the corneo-&#173;retinal standing during light adaptation. The VEP, or VER, is a mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the electrical signal in the brain in response to light stimulus, recorded at the scalp over the occipital cortex; it is a mea&#173;sure of the integrity of the afferent visual pathway. The PERG is a mea&#173;sure of central RGC function and is a less-&#173;direct objective index of macular function than the mfERG.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;8.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> Verteporfin is a photosensitizing drug that is locally activated by &#173;laser during photo&#173;dynamic therapy (PDT). PDT is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularizations (CNVs) associated with AMD, myopia, and presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS). The use of PDT for managing CNV has declined dramatically, given the better success of anti-&#173;VEGF agents, but it remains an adjunctive therapy for CNV in some scenarios. PDT is used off-&#173;label to treat CSC and circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;9.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> A genome-&#173;wide association study of 43,000 &#173;people has identified 52 common and rare ge&#173;ne&#173;tic variants located on 34 loci associated with AMD. The 2 major susceptibility genes for AMD are <span class="italic">CFH</span> (1q31), which codes for complement &#173;factor H, and <span class="italic">ARMS2</span> (10q26), for which the gene product and function are poorly understood. The <span class="italic">CFH</span> Y402H mutation confers a 4.6-&#173;fold increased risk for AMD when heterozygous and a 7.4-&#173;fold increased risk when homozygous. The <span class="italic">ARMS2</span> A69S mutation confers a 2.7-&#173;fold increased risk for AMD when heterozygous and an 8.2-&#173;fold increased risk when homozygous. When both of &#173;these genes are homozygous for the aforementioned mutations in an individual, the risk for AMD is increased to 50-&#173;fold. Although mutations involving <span class="italic">CFI</span> and <span class="italic">APOE</span> have been associated with AMD, they are not the 2 major susceptibility genes.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;10.&#9;<span class="bold">b.</span> In the AREDS (Age-&#173;Related Eye Disease Study), nutritional supplementation with the antioxidant vitamins C (500&#160;mg) and E (400&#160;IU), beta carotene (15&#160;mg), and the micronutrient zinc (80&#160;mg zinc oxide and 2&#160;mg cupric oxide to prevent zinc-&#173;induced anemia) in patients with intermediate or advanced AMD showed a 25% risk reduction for progression to more-&#173;advanced stages of AMD and a 19% risk reduction in rates of moderate vision loss (<span class="symbol">≥</span>3 lines of visual acuity) at 5&#160;years. In the AREDS 2 Study, replacing beta carotene with lutein and zeaxanthin yielded very similar results.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;11.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> In branch ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion (BRVO), obstruction of the vein occurs most commonly at an arteriovenous crossing, where thickening of the arterial wall compresses the adjacent vein within a common adventitial sheath. When the occlusion does not occur at an arteriovenous crossing, the possibility of an under&#173;lying retinochoroiditis or ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculitis should be considered. Hypertension and glaucoma are risk &#173;factors for BRVO but not implicated in occlusion at sites other than arteriovenous crossings. An embolus may cause a ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion but not a ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;12.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> The patient has a central ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion (CRVO). When CRVO occurs in patients more than 50&#160;years of age with typical risk &#173;factors, it is generally considered unnecessary to pursue an elaborate systemic workup. However, in patients younger than 50&#160;years and in absence of common risk &#173;factors, workup for hypercoagulable conditions should be considered. Infectious etiologies are unlikely to cause a CRVO. &#173;Giant cell arteritis is uncommon at a young age and primarily affects arteries. Risk &#173;factor evaluation for thromboembolic disease would be relevant in a patient with a ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;13.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> Branch ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusions are considered embolic events. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal arterial emboli have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality; therefore, emergent referral for embolic workup that includes brain imaging, evaluation of carotid arteries, and transesophageal echocardiography should be considered. Checking erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-&#173;reactive protein (CRP), and platelets would be relevant if &#173;giant cell arteritis is suspected, but that would be less likely with a branch ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion. Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) and applying intermittent pressure on the globe (“ocular massage”) have been suggested but have not been found to be consistently effective in improving the patient’s visual prognosis.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;14.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> The patient’s pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion is consistent with ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS), which is most commonly due to carotid occlusive disease. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy, ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion, and radiation retinopathy can all cause ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages and iris neovascularization, but the ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery pressure is normal in all of &#173;those conditions. An eye with carotid occlusive disease &#173;will have low artery pressure, and the artery &#173;will therefore collapse easily with pressure on the globe. Symptoms of delayed dark adaptation and aching pain pres&#173;ent for months with a normal IOP are also more consistent with OIS and would be less likely in the other conditions.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;15.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy occurs most commonly with sickle cell hemoglobin C (SC), at a rate of approximately 33%. It occurs less commonly with sickle cell thalassemia (SThal), at a rate of approximately 14%. Sickle cell homozygote (SS) disease results in more systemic complications but has a very low incidence of proliferative retinopathy, approximately 3%. Proliferative retinopathy is rare with sickle cell trait (AS).</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;16.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> FA imaging of an eye with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) may show fluorescein leakage in a pattern that resembles a smokestack. This pattern of fluorescein leakage is unique to CSC. Irregular win&#173;dow defects from RPE abnormalities are commonly seen, but similar appearing changes can occur from other conditions, such as AMD. In some cases, the FA appears normal. Multifocal hyperfluorescence is not seen commonly in eyes with CSC. Lacy hyperfluorescence may be seen in rare instances, if the CSC is complicated by a choroidal neovascular membrane.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;17.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> Ret&#173;i&#173;nal tears and subsequent rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment can occur &#173;after peripheral &#173;laser photocoagulation to treat proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal tears occur more commonly &#173;after &#173;laser treatment in proliferative sickle cell retinopathy than in other proliferative retinopathies. Reduced peripheral vision, choroidal detachments, and vitreous hemorrhage may occur &#173;after &#173;laser photocoagulation but do not have a specific predilection for sickle cell retinopathy.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;18.&#9;<span class="bold">b.</span> Von Hippel–&#173;Lindau syndrome is caused by a tumor suppressor gene mutation on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p26–&#173;p25), the inheritance of which is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance and variable expression.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;19.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> Ret&#173;i&#173;nal cavernous hemangiomas may bleed into the vitreous in rare instances. Treatment of ret&#173;i&#173;nal cavernous hemangiomas is indicated in cases with recurrent vitreous hemorrhage. &#173;Laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy may be used. Lipid exudation and ret&#173;i&#173;nal neovascularization do not typically occur from ret&#173;i&#173;nal cavernous hemangiomas. The lesions are static, so progressive enlargement is not expected or seen.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;20.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> Screening should be done on all infants with a birth weight of less than 1500&#160;g or a gestational age of 30 weeks or less. The first examination should generally be performed between 4 and 6 weeks of postnatal age or, alternatively, between 31 and 33 weeks’ postconceptional or postmenstrual age, whichever is &#173;later. In this case the infant is born at 29 weeks, hence the first examination should be done 4 to 6 weeks &#173;after birth.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;21.&#9;<span class="bold">b.</span> The findings are most consistent with acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR). This idiopathic condition typically affects young &#173;women with myopia. The acute onset of posterior photopsias is common to many posterior inflammatory conditions, including multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS) and multifocal choroiditis; however, the loss of outer ret&#173;ina on optical coherence tomography (OCT) differentiates AZOOR from both MEWDS or multifocal choroiditis. Acute macular neuroretinopathy is characterized by 1 or multiple brick-&#173;colored wedge-&#173;shaped or slightly elevated lesions adjacent to or near the fovea, as well as transitory reduction of the visual acuity in affected eyes. Intermediate uveitis is characterized by anterior vitreous cells.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;22.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> The follow-up interval for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening is determined based on the disease features; more severe disease indicates a need for shorter follow-up intervals. A premature infant with immature vascularization in zone I should be reevaluated in 1 week or less, even in the absence of ROP.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;23.&#9;<span class="bold">d.</span> The patient in this clinical scenario has diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN), in the chronic stage. Vitreous cells are commonly observed in retinitis pigmentosa; this condition mimics retinitis pigmentosa (which can be caused by a P23H mutation). Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is almost always bilateral, usually symmetric, and follows a course of chronic deterioration. Viral and fungal infections of the ret&#173;ina and choroid result in active retinitis or chorioretinitis, as well as &#173;later chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal changes or scarring that is usually patchy and not as extensive as &#173;those seen in DUSN.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;24.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> Ablation treatment of threshold or prethreshold type 1 ROP should be accomplished whenever pos&#173;si&#173;ble with &#173;laser surgery rather than cryoablation surgery, &#173;because &#173;laser photocoagulation is associated with less treatment-&#173;related morbidity. Anti–&#173;vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (anti-&#173;VEGF) monotherapy may have similar outcomes to &#173;laser treatment for zone II disease; however, at this time further studies are needed to sufficiently assess the long-&#173;term safety of using anti-&#173;VEGF drugs to treat ROP.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;25.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> The patient almost certainly has CSC. In most cases, initial observation, with the expectation of spontaneous resolution of the subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid, is the appropriate management. Focal argon &#173;laser or photodynamic therapy can be considered for the treatment of CSC if the patient is symptomatic or if the subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid does not resolve &#173;after a period of observation. Ste&#173;roids are contraindicated in a patient with CSC.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;26.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) is an uncommon, usually bilateral inflammatory disorder characterized by acute onset visual loss, usually followed weeks to months &#173;later by substantial or near-&#173;complete improvement. On FA, APMPPE (also known as AMPPE or AMPPPE) in the acute phase demonstrates a characteristic fundus pattern of early lesion blockage, followed by lesion staining in the &#173;middle and late phases. No treatment has been demonstrated to affect the time or final outcome of recovery. Birdshot uveitis is characterized by insidious onset and chronic progression. Multifocal choroiditis is often asymptomatic &#173;unless complicated by acute visual deterioration from CNV involving the central macula. Vision recovery, if it occurs, is typically slow and incomplete following intervention. Serpiginous chorioretinopathy is typically relentlessly progressive, and destroys the RPE on photoreceptors. Thus, recovery of vision, even following immunosuppression, is aty&#173;pi&#173;cal.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;27.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> Individuals with achromatopsia (rod monochromatism and S-&#173;cone monochromatism) and albinism (ocular and oculocutaneous) share the features of photophobia, decreased visual acuity, and nystagmus. The absence of iris transillumination would eliminate &#173;either type of albinism but would not indicate which type of achromatopsia was pres&#173;ent. Similarly, although all 4 conditions have a ge&#173;ne&#173;tic basis, the presence of an affected &#173;brother would not indicate &#173;whether inheritance is autosomal recessive, as in rod monochromatism and oculocutaneous albinism, or X-&#173;linked, as in S-&#173;cone monochromatism and ocular albinism. Red-&#173;green color deficits such as deuteranomaly are common, are not accompanied by the additional findings above, and are most often X-&#173;linked. &#173;Because ERG testing can be used to assess cone function (including &#173;whether any S-&#173;cone function remains), it can thus help the clinician establish a diagnosis in this scenario.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;28.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> Immune system sensitization to choroidal antigens is much less likely if the inciting tissues are removed within 14 days of exposure. Therefore, prevention of sympathetic ophthalmia is the primary reason for the early enucleation. Enucleation should be contemplated within 2 weeks following visually nonrecoverable penetrating ocular injury. Chronic pain may result from penetrating injury, but its management with enucleation is not time-&#173;dependent. Similarly, bacterial endophthalmitis and/or lens-&#173;associated uveitis can be managed medically or by enucleation, and if surgical removal is necessary, it can be performed when required for medical management or cosmesis.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;29.&#9;<span class="bold">d.</span> A negative ERG describes a bright-&#173;flash, dark-&#173;adapted ERG with a normal or near-&#173;normal a-&#173;wave but a b-&#173;wave with markedly decreased amplitude. This pattern can be associated with some forms of congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), as well as with melanoma-&#173;associated retinopathy (MAR), which may be accompanied by acquired nyctalopia. The electronegative ERG is also a feature of juvenile X-&#173;linked retinitis pigmentosa and central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusions. Unlike retinitis pigmentosa, in which the ERG a-&#173;wave is also abnormal and progressive visual field loss occurs, CSNB is nonprogressive. CSNB is a hereditary and most-&#173;often X-&#173;linked condition in which individuals may have variable degrees of nystagmus and decreased visual acuity. Some individuals with CSNB have a paradoxical pupillary response in which the pupil constricts in response to decreased light.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;30.&#9;<span class="bold">b.</span> Pleiotropy is the term for mutations in a single gene that may lead to multiple phenotypes. An excellent example of this is the <span class="italic">ABCA4</span> gene, which has differing phenotypes for dif&#173;fer&#173;ent mutations within the gene. The most common phenotype caused by mutation of <span class="italic">ABCA4</span> is Stargardt disease (autosomal recessive, requires both alleles to harbor disease-&#173;causing mutations), but other mutations may cause pattern dystrophy, cone–&#173;rod dystrophy, or autosomal-&#173;recessive retinitis pigmentosa. Ge&#173;ne&#173;tic heterogeneity is the term that describes multiple genes that give rise to an indistinguishable phenotype. For instance, mutations in at least 17 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent genes may lead to Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Disorders caused by a mutation in a single allele arise from dominant inheritance. If mutations in both alleles are necessary to cause disease, then the inheritance is recessive.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;31.&#9;<span class="bold">d.</span> When early-&#173;onset drusen are associated with CNV in young adulthood, the diagnosis of Sorsby macular dystrophy should be considered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstrating a disease-&#173;causing mutation in the <span class="italic">TIMP3</span> gene. Doyne honeycomb dystrophy, Malattia Leventinese, and radial drusen are the same disorder, and are caused by mutation in the <span class="italic">EFEMP1</span> gene. Cuticular drusen is a clinical syndrome of small clustered drusen in young adults. Although associated with mutation in complement &#173;factor H, in contrast to the other choices, cuticular drusen is not a monogenic disorder.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;32.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> The clinical description is most consistent with Bietti crystalline dystrophy, which is associated with mutations in the <span class="italic">CYP4Y2</span> gene. Oxalosis is a rare inherited disorder of primary hyperoxaluria, which has been associated with mutations in 3 genes (<span class="italic">AGXT, </span><span class="italic">GRHPR, DHDPSL</span>). Cystinosis is an abnormality of cystine accumulation that may result from ge&#173;ne&#173;tic &#173;causes (mutation in the <span class="italic">CTNS</span> gene) or exposure to some anesthetics. Typically, patients with oxalosis and cystinosis have renal insufficiency or failure resulting from amino acid crystallization in the kidneys. Tamoxifen retinopathy is a perifoveal crystalline retinopathy resulting from ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxicity to tamoxifen, an antiestrogen drug used as adjuvant treatment for estrogen-&#173;responsive breast cancer.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;33.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> All of the answer options are systemic metabolic disorders with associated ret&#173;i&#173;nal degenerations. In abetalipoproteinemia, the failure to synthesize apolipoprotein B results in abnormal absorption of fat and fat-&#173;soluble vitamins, leading to prob&#173;lems including ret&#173;i&#173;nal and spinocerebellar degeneration. Treatment with vitamins A and E is advised. Refsum disease results from elevated plasma levels of phytanic acid, for which dietary restriction of phytanic acid precursors such as dairy products and some meats is advised. Zellweger syndrome is a peroxisomal disease resulting from defective oxidation and accumulation of very-&#173;long-&#173;chain fatty acids. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) results from the lysosomal accumulation of lipopigments, and some forms may first pres&#173;ent with visual symptoms. No interventions are currently available for NCL or Zellweger syndrome.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;34.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> Ciliopathies are diseases or syndromes in which a mutation in a gene needed for ciliary function affects multiple organ systems. Usher syndrome is a ciliopathy defined by the association of retinitis pigmentosa with congenital sensorineural hearing loss. In contrast, maternally inherited diabetes and deafness is a mitochondrial disease. Bardet-&#173;Biedl syndrome is a ciliopathy with findings that include pigmentary retinopathy and bull’s-&#173;eye maculopathy, obesity, polydactyly, hypogonadism, renal disease, and cognitive disability. Joubert syndrome is a ciliopathy characterized by cerebellar malformation (“molar tooth” sign) and hypotonia, with additional features that include ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophy and renal disease.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;35.&#9;<span class="bold">d.</span> Batten disease, which is an example of a neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, can have ret&#173;i&#173;nal findings including an atrophic bull’s-&#173;eye maculopathy, optic nerve pallor, and attenuation of ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels. The ophthalmic symptoms and signs may be the first, earliest manifestations of this disorder. Pigmentary abnormalities and fine ret&#173;i&#173;nal crystals are pres&#173;ent in cystinosis. The cherry-&#173;red spots seen in Tay-&#173;Sachs result from ganglioside accumulation within ganglion cells. Tortuous and dilated ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels, as well as corneal verticillata and tortuous conjunctival vessels, are pres&#173;ent in Fabry disease.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;36.&#9;<span class="bold">d.</span> Nicotinic acid, a treatment for elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, in rare cases characteristically &#173;causes a cystoid macular edema that demonstrates no leakage or staining on fundus fluorescein angiography. Fingolimod, a drug used to treat multiple sclerosis, can cause conventional cystoid macular edema with typical late leakage in a “petaloid,” or flower-&#173;shaped, pattern. Similarly, rosiglitazone, a newer oral hypoglycemic agent, may cause conventional cystoid macular edema that may be confused with diabetic macular edema. Paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent, may also cause a reversible, angiographically &#173;silent cystoid macular edema, but this is rare.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;37.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> “Poppers” is a slang term for alkyl nitrites, which are a class of chemical used as recreational drugs. The chemicals are inhaled to induce euphoria and relax smooth muscles, usually in preparation for sexual activity. In rare cases, use can lead to acute central scotoma and vision reduction associated with a yellow, “vitelliform”-&#173;like macular lesion. In rare cases, MEK inhibitors, which are a class of chemotherapeutic agents, and sildenafil have been associated with serous macular fluid, which may simulate central serous choroidopathy. Corticosteroids may precipitate serous exudation from central serous retinopathy.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;38.&#9;<span class="bold">b.</span> Round holes rarely lead to ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, but may complicate repair if the ret&#173;ina is detached due to other, higher-&#173;risk breaks. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal dialyses, &#173;horse&#173;shoe or flap tears, and slit tears at the edge of lattice degeneration are higher-&#173;risk tears and are typically treated with demarcation &#173;laser, even if asymptomatic.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;39.&#9;<span class="bold">b.</span> Many, if not most, tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments begin distant from the fovea and are typically asymptomatic &#173;unless they have recently converted to a combined rhegmatogenous-&#173;tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. Similarly, retinoschisis is usually asymptomatic, but if an outer layer break develops and &#173;causes an associated rhegmatogenous component, the detachment becomes symptomatic. Exudative ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments (in par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar, macular detachments associated with CNV) and rhegmatogenous ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments are usually symptomatic.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;40.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> Vitreous opacities can be one of the initial signs of familial amyloidosis. Amyloid material can also be deposited elsewhere in ocular structures, and early nonocular complaints may include peripheral neuropathies. Congo red staining of vitreous samples can confirm the diagnosis. Asteroid hyalosis is typically unilateral and is rarely visually significant. Cholesterolosis, or synchysis scintillans, occurs in eyes with a history of intravitreal hemorrhage usually related to prior accidental or surgical ocular trauma. Although prior ophthalmic pathology leading to dehemoglobinized vitreous hemorrhage should always be considered, it is less likely in this scenario.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;41.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> Anterior per&#173;sis&#173;tent fetal vasculature is characterized by a retrolental fibrovascular membrane. Angle-&#173;closure glaucoma can result from the lenticular abnormalities associated with this membrane, and incomplete development of the &#173;angle can also contribute to glaucoma. Posterior per&#173;sis&#173;tent fetal vasculature does not involve the anterior segment structures, and therefore is not associated with angle-&#173;closure glaucoma. Open-&#173;angle glaucoma can be pres&#173;ent in Stickler syndrome. Remnants of the tunica vasculosa lentis, including Mittendorf dots, are common and visually insignificant.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;42.&#9;<span class="bold">d.</span> The chalcosis and siderosis bulbi that result from retaining intraocular copper and iron, respectively, have distinct manifestations. Pure copper can cause an intense inflammatory response, whereas a copper content of less than 85% can result in chronic chalcosis, with findings that include sunflower cataract and a Kayser-&#173;Fleischer-&#173;like ring of deposits in Descemet membrane. Intraocular iron deposits in neuroepithelial tissues produce findings that include ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigmentation. ERG can be used to assess ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxicity in siderosis bulbi.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;43.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> A complex interplay of all of &#173;these &#173;factors influences the visual prognosis &#173;after globe trauma, but as a general guide and as represented by The Ocular Trauma Score, initial visual acuity is the most impor&#173;tant predictor of final visual outcome.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;44.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> The goal of subthreshold &#173;laser is to achieve the therapeutic benefits of &#173;laser while minimizing secondary ret&#173;i&#173;nal damage. The micropulse doses limit heat conduction from the RPE to photoreceptors and thus minimize neuroret&#173;i&#173;nal damage and the size and number of scotomas. Computer software is critical in planning and applying treatment, &#173;because the &#173;laser spots cannot be directly visualized.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;45.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> The clinical history is characteristic of <span class="italic">Propionibacterium acnes</span> endophthalmitis. Although injection of intravitreous antibiotics may clear the infection in up to 50% of cases, an appropriate management is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with partial capsulectomy and antibiotic injection. Occasionally, removal of the intraocular lens and the entire capsular bag is required to definitively treat the condition. Sampling the anterior chamber, especially the vitreous, is the usual approach for identification of the causative microbe, not for management of the condition. However, &#173;because <span class="italic">P acnes</span> is an obligate microaerophilic bacterium, it may not survive in a culture &#173;unless that culture is maintained in a low-&#173;oxygen environment. Thus, the culture positivity rate is low. Topical antibiotics and ste&#173;roids &#173;will treat the symptoms, but &#173;will not eradicate the infection.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;46.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> Axial high myopia is a risk &#173;factor for ocular perforation with a retrobulbar injection. It is a relative, not an absolute, contraindication. Older age is not a contraindication to retrobulbar anesthesia injection. Use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a relative contraindication to general anesthesia, not retrobulbar anesthesia, &#173;because laryngeal swelling following intubation may necessitate hospitalization for postanesthesia observation. &#173;Because obesity may make endotracheal intubation more difficult, the use of retrobulbar anesthesia would be favored.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;47.&#9;<span class="bold">c.</span> Proliferative vitreoretinopathy is defined as membrane proliferation associated with &#173;ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. This condition necessarily results in ret&#173;i&#173;nal traction (especially grade C or higher) that requires vitrectomy to achieve ret&#173;i&#173;nal reattachment. Multiple ret&#173;i&#173;nal tears and ret&#173;i&#173;nal dialysis (especially without an associated ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment) are typically treated with &#173;laser or cryopexy demarcation. Vitreous hemorrhage that spares the visual axis may only require observation or treatment of the under&#173;lying condition (such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy), depending upon the setting and any associated disorders.</p>
			<p class="endmatter-answers">&#9;48.&#9;<span class="bold">a.</span> Vitritis, or inflammation of the vitreous, is the first presenting feature of injection-&#173;related endophthalmitis. It is perceived by patients as progressive floaters and blurring of vision, often culminating in essentially no formed vision (eg, light perception only). Immediate evaluation is necessary to determine &#173;whether endophthalmitis is pres&#173;ent. Sharp pain following the injection or foreign body sensation are likely caused by surface irritation or damage form the povidone iodine solution, the manipulation of the conjunctiva, or from the needle stick. Occasionally, patients may suffer severe pain that that starts some time following the injection, which may be caused by corneal abrasions. Small floaters that are noticed immediately following injection are usually caused by small air &#173;bubbles, and less commonly by silicone oil &#173;bubbles from the syringe lubricant, in the injected liquid, a common occurrence. Air &#173;bubbles usually dis&#173;appear &#173;after a few hours, while the silicone oil &#173;bubbles persist, but usually float out of view.</p>
