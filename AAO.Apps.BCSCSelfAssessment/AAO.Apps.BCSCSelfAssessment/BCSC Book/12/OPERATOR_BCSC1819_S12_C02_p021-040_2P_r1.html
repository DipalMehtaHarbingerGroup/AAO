			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Testing for ret&#173;i&#173;nal disease is directed by the clinical examination of the patient, which starts with obtaining a thorough patient history, including &#173;family history, and a careful review of systems. The patient should undergo a detailed ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity mea&#173;sure&#173;ment and testing for a relative afferent pupillary defect. In addition, in-&#173;office Amsler grid testing can provide evidence of macular disease, if pres&#173;ent.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This chapter explores some of the imaging modalities used to evaluate ret&#173;i&#173;nal disease. Each modality supplies a limited set of information; no par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar modality supplies all of the information about &#173;every disease. In order to understand the layers of the fundus and their disease manifestations, it is necessary to employ multimodal imaging, mastering many forms of ocular imaging and rapidly integrating the information gleaned into a more complete &#173;whole.</p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-3">Ophthalmoscopy</p>
			<div id="Chapt2_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The direct ophthalmoscope provides an upright, monocular, high-&#173;magnification (15<span class="symbol">×</span>) image of the ret&#173;ina. The instrument’s lack of stereopsis, small field of view (5°–8°), and poor view of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal periphery limit its use. Therefore, indirect ophthalmoscopy has largely supplanted direct ophthalmoscopy. In indirect ophthalmoscopy, illumination is directed into the eye through an aspheric lens; this lens helps form a flat inverted aerial image between the lens and the observer. The magnification is calculated by dividing the dioptric power of the examination lens into –60. For example, a 20 D lens would have a magnification of –3; the negative sign indicates an inverted image. The binocular indirect ophthalmoscope has a unitary magnification. Through the use of prisms, it reduces the distance between the pupils in the instrument, and, using a mirror, it reduces the distance from the light source to the optical axis, so that all 3 fit into the entrance pupil of the eye (see Chapter&#160;8 in BCSC Section&#160;3, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics</span>). Binocular indirect ophthalmoscopes allow for stereopsis, have a field of view that depends on the dioptric power of the condensing lens (higher powers deliver wider &#173;angles of view, but at a lesser magnification), and, with ocular steering, can visualize the entire fundus as compared with direct ophthalmoscopes. If the patient’s pupil can be dilated widely, the ora serrata may be seen without any additional instrumentation. If the pupil cannot be widely dilated or the clinician needs to see peripheral ret&#173;i&#173;nal details in profile, scleral depression must be performed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The disadvantages of binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy include low magnification and the inverted image. A binocular indirect ophthalmoscope offers no additional magnification of the aerial image. Indirect ophthalmoscopy can also be performed with a slit lamp by using a non–&#173;contact lens, for example, a 60 D or 78 D lens. With a 60 D lens, the magnification afforded by the lens is 1; however, the slit lamp typically has a magnification of 10<span class="symbol">×</span> or 16<span class="symbol">×</span>. The slit beam can be used to directly or indirectly illuminate the posterior portion of the vitreous as well as ret&#173;i&#173;nal structures. The field of view provided by the lenses is good; a &#173;little less than 70° with a 60 D lens and more than 80° with the 78 D lens. Ocular steering can be used to evaluate a large area of the fundus. Higher dioptric lenses can help visualize wide areas of the ret&#173;ina even if the pupil does not dilate. &#173;These lenses may have a field of view of 100° or more. With noncontact indirect biomicroscopy, the power and capabilities of a slit lamp with a wide field of view may be employed without having to contact the eye; subsequent ocular imaging can proceed without a prob&#173;lem &#173;because no contact is made with the cornea. The main disadvantage is that the image created is inverted.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A direct-&#173;contact lens provides 1 of the highest resolution methods to view the fundus. Although &#173;these lenses provide no significant magnification, they obviate the refractive power, and potentially any astigmatism, of the cornea. The 3-&#173;mirror lens is commonly used in this method. The central portion is used to directly visualize the posterior pole and has a field of view of a &#173;little more than 20°. The 3 mirrors can be used to evaluate the midperiphery and far periphery of the ret&#173;ina as well as the &#173;angle. The advantages of direct-&#173;contact biomicroscopy include high resolution and a noninverted image. The disadvantages include having a limited field of view through any 1 component of the lens, needing to rotate the lens on the patient’s eye while performing the examination, and needing to manipulate the cornea or use a viscous coupling fluid, &#173;either of which may hinder subsequent ocular imaging. Indirect-&#173;contact lenses provide the largest field of view of any lens used for ophthalmoscopy, often more than 150°. They can be used with ocular steering to easily visualize the ora serrata.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Lenses are chosen at the discretion of the examining clinician, according to what is needed for the specific examination. For example, an opacified posterior capsule with a small posterior capsulotomy may inhibit good visualization of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal periphery with a 3-&#173;mirror lens, but pose no significant prob&#173;lem for a wide-&#173;field indirect-&#173;contact lens.</p>

			<div id="Chapt2_Top2">
			<p class="h2-h1">Fundus Camera Imaging</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The fundus camera uses a variation of indirect ophthalmoscopy in which the objective lens is used to deliver a cone of light through the entrance pupil, subsequently forming a flat inverted aerial image within the body of the camera, using light reflected from the eye. This image is transferred and projected on to an image sensor through a system of relay lenses. Fundus cameras use flash illumination to obtain high-&#173;quality images of the eye. Color fundus photography provides photographic rec&#173;ords of the state of a patient’s fundus for the patient’s medical rec&#173;ords; &#173;these images may also be used in research and for teaching. &#173;Because a large amount of information can be extracted from a &#173;simple color fundus photo&#173;graph (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-1</span>), this mode of imaging has been the cornerstone of many large epidemiologic and treatment studies. The color rendition is the best of any imaging system in terms of color accuracy, noise, and resolution. With the use of filters, the fundus camera can also be used to obtain fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, in addition to autofluorescence. Imaging from fundus cameras may suffer from cloudy media in which light scattering obscures fundus details and reduces image contrast. A capacitor must be charged to power the flash unit; therefore, fundus cameras are typically only able to rec&#173;ord images at a speed of approximately once per second.</p>
			<p class="h2">Scanning &#173;Laser Ophthalmoscopy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The confocal scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) generates ret&#173;i&#173;nal images by scanning an illuminated spot on the ret&#173;ina in a raster pattern. It uses a Maxwellian view system to build the ret&#173;i&#173;nal image. &#173;Because the system is confocal, the scattered light can be rejected by the crystalline lens, as can the fluorescence, allowing for the use of shorter wavelengths in autofluorescence imaging. A photodiode is used to detect the light received from the eye. &#173;Because photodiodes are cheaper than high-&#173;resolution 2-&#173;dimensional sensors, some of the increased costs of the scanning mechanism are offset.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A variety of wavelengths can be used as dictated by need and the availability of a &#173;laser system. Infrared imaging can be used to evaluate the fundus; in some circumstances, it provides more comprehensive information than that revealed by color photography. For example, some types of pseudodrusen (subret&#173;i&#173;nal drusenoid deposits) are not as prominent in color fundus photo&#173;graphs, but are easy to view in infrared images. Choroidal nevi reflect infrared light, consequently appearing bright in infrared imaging. The infrared image can be used to perform ocular tracking.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The chief &#173;factor that determines the resolution of SLOs is the size of the illuminated spot on the ret&#173;ina, which in turn is determined by the wavelength used, the numerical aperture of the illuminating system, any aberrations in the optical system, and scattering. SLOs scan the fundus with a dense pattern of spots. The resolution depends on the number of spots per unit area; a metric that is sometimes called the “digital resolution.” The digital resolution is invariably higher than the true optical resolution &#173;because the spots overlap.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In angiography, the dye is injected and then imaging begins. Some systems are able to obtain high-&#173;speed (eg, 15 frames per second) imaging of the dye’s passage through the eye. If the excitation &#173;laser and the barrier filter are put into place, no fluorescein dye is used, and the gain is turned up, an autofluorescent image of the fundus can be obtained. This method uses a blue-&#173;green wavelength that is absorbed by macular pigment. The field of view of a scanning &#173;laser imaging system is determined by its mechanical scanning system as well as the optics used to image the eye. The posterior pole can be imaged using vari&#173;ous scan par&#173;ameters. With wider-&#173;angle lens attachments, up to 55°, and in some cases 110°, can be visualized.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A second approach to scanning &#173;laser ophthalmoscopy uses an ellipsoidal mirror. Rays emanating from one focus point on an ellipse &#173;will converge on the second focus point. If ellipse is rotated along an axis, an ellipsoidal surface can be generated. If this surface is then made into a mirror, rays passing through one point &#173;will converge on the second point. If one point is placed at the entrance pupil of the eye, light rays emanating from a large solid &#173;angle &#173;will converge on the second focus point of the ellipsoidal mirror to form an image. Commercial systems that use this princi&#173;ple are able to obtain images approximately 200° wide. With ocular steering, nearly all of the ret&#173;ina can be imaged. In this method, 2 &#173;lasers are used to obtain a pseudocolor-&#173;scaled image: a red &#173;laser and a green &#173;laser. Angiography can be performed with the use of the appropriate excitation &#173;lasers. The number of points imaged is large, and &#173;these systems do not rec&#173;ord video-&#173;rate angiography. The systems that employ an ellipsoidal mirror have limited confocality; a green &#173;laser needs to be used in order obtain autofluorescent images.</p>
			<p class="h2">Optical Coherence Tomography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive, noncontact imaging modality that produces micrometer-&#173;resolution images of tissue. Low-&#173;coherence light is directed into tissue and into a reference arm. An interferometer combines the light returning from the tissue with the light from the reference arm, producing an interferogram. The benefit of using low-&#173;coherence light is that its spectral makeup changes rapidly with time; thus, light produced at a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar instant &#173;will not interfere well with light produced at other times. This means the exact position from which the interfering light came can be determined by the resolution dictated by the coherence length of the light source, which is typically 5–7 µm. In any given A-&#173;scan, time-&#173;domain OCT is used to interrogate each point in the tissue sequentially. In more modern techniques, for example &#173;either spectral-&#173;domain (SD) or swept-&#173;source (SS) OCT, a more efficient approach is taken. In SD-&#173;OCT, a broad-&#173;spectrum light source is used, and the resulting interferogram produced varies with the reflectivity of the tissue. SS-&#173;OCT uses a more complicated light source that sequentially scans through successive wavelengths of light across a spectral range (see Optical Coherence Tomography Technologies: A Comparison of SD-&#173;OCT and SS-&#173;OCT).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Both SD-&#173;OCT and SS-&#173;OCT create an A-&#173;scan through tissue. B-&#173;scans consist of a collection of many A-&#173;scans conducted through a plane of tissue. A volume scan consists of an assembly of numerous B-&#173;scans; this volume scan is stored in computer memory as a block of data in which each memory location stores a value that corresponds to a specific small volume of tissue. The <span class="italic">voxels</span> (a portmanteau of volume and pixels) in the volume of data may be represented in many ways; 1 &#173;simple way is to make planar slices producing an image called a C-&#173;scan. C-&#173;scans are difficult to interpret &#173;because in a curved structure, many planes of tissue can be crossed. Another, more advanced method is to segment the data according to tissue planes; a thickness of voxels presented this way is called an <span class="italic">en face scan.</span> The tissue thicknesses can be mea&#173;sured in an en face scan; the ret&#173;i&#173;nal nerve fiber layer is commonly mea&#173;sured. Maps of the thickness of the ret&#173;ina or a specific ret&#173;i&#173;nal layer can also be produced. &#173;Actual correlation between OCT scans and histology of the ret&#173;ina has not yet been thoroughly explored, and the correlation of the identity of structures seen in OCT has changed numerous times. The International Nomenclature of OCT Panel has proposed nomenclature terminology, but &#173;these assignments are likely to change over time (Activity 2-1).</p>

			<p class="body-text">Some OCT scanners offer eye movement tracking. With the addition of this feature, ocular motion can be detected and corrected in the final image, improving the quality of the resulting scan. Tracking methods rely on recognizing fundus features and registering the scan pattern with the fundus image. This capability expands the utility of OCT; with it, scans interrupted by patient blinks still produce usable images. In addition, it is pos&#173;si&#173;ble to perform repeated scans of the same fundus location over time, enabling assessment of disease progression (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to B-&#173;scans and en face imaging, volume rendering shows the 3-&#173;dimensional character of the tissue. Compared to ordinary B-&#173;scans, volume rendering is computationally intensive. It is used in radiology, but is not yet widely used in ophthalmology (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-3</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In a series of images taken at a sufficient interval, a moving object &#173;will appear at dif&#173;fer&#173;ent positions on the successive images. When &#173;these images are compared pixel by pixel, nonmoving regions &#173;will show no change, while moving objects &#173;will produce areas that show high variance. If the color black is assigned to areas of low variance (ie, areas that do not move), and the color white is assigned to areas with high variance, then the resulting image &#173;will highlight movement; this is called motion contrast. The ret&#173;ina has no moving parts, except for the flow of blood. If the images are high resolution, successive ret&#173;i&#173;nal images can show the movement of blood through the ret&#173;ina. Images taken with OCT are not only high resolution but also depth-&#173;resolved. Therefore, data obtained from tissue can be compared with successive data. The result is a 3-&#173;dimensional visualization of movement within the ret&#173;ina, corresponding to blood flow in its vari&#173;ous layers.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Unlike fluorescein angiography, which can only visualize the superficial capillary plexus, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) can image all capillary layers, including the superficial plexus, the radial peripapillary capillary network, and the deep vascular plexus. This provides huge opportunities to advance our understanding of ret&#173;i&#173;nal diseases. En face OCT is another way to visualize flow information. En face imaging of flow in the ret&#173;ina is a useful technique &#173;because the resulting image of the ret&#173;ina is arranged in layers, as is its blood supply. In this method, a slab of the flow information corresponding to the expected position of a layer of vessels is selected. Next, the brightest pixel in each column of voxels is selected and displayed, which is called a maximal intensity projection. This projection creates a flat image from the data, which exists in 3 dimensions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">OCTA can visualize the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vasculature at a higher resolution than any other current imaging modality (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-4</span>). However, OCTA is prone to artifacts; understanding how &#173;these artifacts are created is key to understanding and interpreting the images produced. Motion results in bright areas in the image, but this motion does not necessarily come from blood flow. For example, if the patient’s eye moves during the examination, portions of the resulting image &#173;will contain motion artifacts. Multiple automatic scans with eye tracking and software repair can suppress most motion artifacts. Another type of defect, called a projection artifact, is created when light passes through a blood vessel and strikes a deeper reflective structure; over time, the light that reflects from that structure &#173;will change, mimicking the overlying blood vessel. The image created &#173;will have what appears to be 2 levels of the same vessel: the first at its &#173;actual location and the second at the level of the reflecting structure. Several mathematical approaches can remove projection artifacts. A third potential issue in OCTA is the appearance of dark areas on the image. Dark areas visualized in the fundus can be the result of a lack of blood flow, or at least blood flow too slow to be detected in successive scans at the interval time used. However, frequently it is too difficult to ascertain &#173;whether &#173;there is a true lack of flow, so the dark areas on the images are called signal voids.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fi&#173;nally, segmentation works well on normal ret&#173;i&#173;nas, but the more diseased a ret&#173;ina is, the less accurate the segmentation becomes. If the layer has not been segmented properly, it becomes much more difficult to visualize the flow in any given layer. This difficulty has led to the creation of alternate methods of showing flow data, such as volume rendering (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-5</span>).</p>
			<p class="h2">Fundus Autofluorescence</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fundus autofluorescence (AF) is a rapid, noncontact, noninvasive way to visualize fluorophores in the fundus. In this method, excitation light is introduced to the eye; fluorescence from intrinsic fluorophores is detected by using a barrier filter to exclude that excitation light from the image. The creation of fluorophores starts with visual pigment, which contains many conjugated double bonds. The visual pigment’s absorption of light energy may also lead to the creation of reactive molecular species that can cross-&#173;react to other molecules; 1 such molecule is the bis-&#173;retinoid A2E, a component derived from 2 molecules of vitamin A aldehyde and 1 molecule of ethanolamine. A2E appears to accumulate in Stargardt disease, in which a defective adenosine triphosphate–&#173;binding cassette protein (encoded by <span class="italic">ABCA4</span>) prevents proper transport of vitamin A derivatives across disc membranes in photoreceptors. This &#173;causes abnormal accumulation of 11-&#173;<span class="italic">trans</span>-&#173;retinal and several downstream reaction byproducts that are difficult for ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells to pro&#173;cess. &#173;These products then accumulate in lysosomes as lipofuscin. Similar bis-&#173;retinoids accumulate within the lysosomes of RPE cells as a normal part of the aging pro&#173;cess; they are not necessarily harmful. If the RPE cell dies, the contained lipofuscin disperses, resulting in a loss of autofluorescence, so that &#173;these areas appear dark on autofluorescence images. If &#173;there is a tear in the RPE, which is usually seen patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV), the scrolled RPE is hyperautofluorescent &#173;because of reduplication, while the bared area shows no autofluorescence signal (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-6</span>). This mechanism of autofluorescence loss is used to monitor the absence of RPE cells in a variety of diseases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">&#173;There are 2 main types of systems used to image autofluorescence. A fundus camera uses special filters that are tuned to detect autofluorescence from lipofuscin without being swamped by autofluorescence from the crystalline lens, which may be derived, in part, from tryptophan and by nonenzymatic glycosylation of lens proteins. &#173;These cameras use wavelengths in the green end of the spectrum, and the recorded autofluorescence begins closer to the orange wavelengths. The excitation wavelengths are not absorbed by macular pigment. Commercial SLOs initially used blue excitation light intended to excite fluorescein, but &#173;these wavelengths &#173;were absorbed by macular pigment. &#173;Later, using a green &#173;laser for excitation was introduced; green light is not absorbed by macular pigment. By comparing the ratio of green light autofluorescence in 2 registered fundus images, it is pos&#173;si&#173;ble to make a 2-&#173;dimensional map of macular pigment density.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Although lipofuscin in the RPE is the main source of autofluorescence from the fundus, accumulation of fluorophore in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space is another impor&#173;tant signal source for the evaluation of some diseases, such as central serous chorioretinopathy. &#173;After the disease is pres&#173;ent for a few months, the detachment becomes lighter and slightly more yellow in color, and the detachment also becomes hyperautofluorescent. This hyperautofluorescence is easier to detect with a fundus camera than with an SLO system for 2 main reasons. First, SLO systems are confocal; if the plane of focus is at the level of the RPE, the top of the detachment may not be in the confocal range. Second, the wavelengths used for fundus camera autofluorescence are more closely tuned to the fluorescence wavelengths emitted by fluorophores in the ret&#173;ina. Upon OCT imaging, an accumulation of material was found on the back surface of the ret&#173;ina in eyes with central serous chorioretinopathy with hyperautofluorescent detachments. It is thought that the photoreceptor outer segments are typically phagocytized and pro&#173;cessed by the RPE, but if the ret&#173;ina has been physically elevated by fluid, the photoreceptors become separated from the RPE, thus impeding phagocytosis. This mechanism of disease pathophysiology may also be seen in vitelliform deposits in vitelliform macular dystrophy, adult vitelliform lesions, the yellow material that builds up &#173;under chronic ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments caused by optic pit maculopathy, and pockets of retained subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid &#173;after detachment surgery.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Near-&#173;infrared fundus autofluorescence (NIA) imaging using 787-nm excitation and greater than 800-nm emission reveals fluorescence that was previously attributed to melanin from the RPE and the deeper layers of the choroid. However, lipofuscin can also fluoresce in the wavelengths mentioned, and it appears that during lipofuscin pro&#173;cessing, melanosomes are fused with lysosomes to produce melanolysosomes. The melanin may bind to some of the &#173;free radicals in lipofuscin, but in any case, molecular cross-&#173;linking occurs. The resulting melanolipofuscin also fluoresces in the selected ranges. Thus, it may be pos&#173;si&#173;ble to detect differing molecular species with autofluorescence. In addition, in time-&#173;resolved fluorescence imaging, dif&#173;fer&#173;ent molecules can fluoresce at the same wavelengths but at measurably dif&#173;fer&#173;ent times &#173;after excitation. Using time-&#173;resolved imaging with a phasor approach allows in vivo identification of vari&#173;ous molecular species, as well as mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the reduction–&#173;oxidation reaction state. Studies are being conducted on hyperspectral autofluorescence in which differing wavelengths of fluorescence are mea&#173;sured in order to try to understand more about the formation of component molecules.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Adaptive Optics Imaging</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Adaptive optics imaging is a collection of techniques that compensates for wavefront alterations in real time. &#173;These techniques, which &#173;were developed for use in astronomical telescopes, can help compensate for changes induced by variations in tear film and ocular currents, among other &#173;causes. The photoreceptors in the ret&#173;ina can act as waveguides; if light is within the ac&#173;cep&#173;tance &#173;angle of the waveguide they augment the reflection produced. This augmentation provides an opportunity to visualize individual photoreceptors in the ret&#173;ina. &#173;These photoreceptors are stimulated with a &#173;laser, allowing imaging information to be obtained about specific types of photoreceptors. However, this type of imaging is extremely time consuming, and it requires expensive custom-&#173;built instruments to obtain satisfactory results. Significant adoption of adaptive optics imaging in eye clinics has been prevented by the time required, the complexity of the instrumentation, and the limited ability to image all patients (eg, patients with media opacities or intraocular lenses cannot be imaged).</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Angiographic Techniques</p>
			<p class="h3-h2">Fluorescein angiography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Fluorescein dye ranges from yellow to orange-&#173;red in color, depending on its concentration. Its peak excitation is 465–490&#160;nm and its peak emission is 520–530&#160;nm in physiologic environments. Fluorescein is approximately 80% protein-&#173;bound in circulation; the blood–&#173;retina barrier prevents it from diffusing into ret&#173;i&#173;nal tissue. However, leakage can show in areas with new vessel growth, which lack a blood–&#173;ocular barrier, or regions with blood–&#173;ocular barrier defects induced by inflammation or ischemia. Fluorescein readily leaks from the choriocapillaris, staining the surrounding tissue. This rapid leakage, as well as the light absorption and scattering by the pigment in the RPE and choroid, prevents widespread use of fluorescein in choroidal imaging.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Typically, 2–3&#160;mL of a 25% sterile solution or 5&#160;mL of a 10% sterile solution is injected in the antecubital vein. The dye is typically vis&#173;i&#173;ble within 12 to 14 seconds, rapidly filling the arterial system (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-7</span>). It is pos&#173;si&#173;ble to detect dye in the choroidal circulation before the ret&#173;i&#173;nal arteries fill; in the eyes of young, healthy patients, the arteries fill in 1 or 2 seconds, and dye begins to appear in a laminar filling pattern in the ret&#173;i&#173;nal veins. The choroid may not fill uniformly. Any areas in the choroid that fill by the time the ret&#173;i&#173;nal circulation reaches the laminar flow stage are considered signs of abnormal choroidal filling. Once dye reaches the choriocapillaris, it leaks and stains Bruch membrane and the stroma, and details in the choroid are lost. If the dye injection was rapid, the bolus of dye &#173;will enter <br />and leave the ocular circulation only to return a few seconds &#173;later; this is called the recirculation phase. During the fluorescein angiogram, the fovea appears darker than the surrounding areas &#173;because of the presence of macular pigment; the RPE cells &#173;under the macula are slightly taller and contain more melanin than peripheral RPE cells, and &#173;there are no ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels. Over several minutes, the dye is removed from circulation and the intensity of the fluorescence decreases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Abnormalities observed with FA can be grouped into 3 categories, each associated with one of the following types of fluorescence:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-7">autofluorescence</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">hypofluorescence</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-8">hyperfluorescence</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Auto</span>fluorescence is fluorescence that appears with the excitation and barrier filters in place before the fluorescein dye is injected; it is caused by endogenously fluo&#173;rescent constituents of tissue such as accumulation of outer segments, lipofuscin, or optic nerve head drusen. <span class="italic">Hypo</span>fluorescence occurs when normal fluorescence is reduced or absent; it is pre&#173;sent in 2 major patterns:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-9">1.&#9;vascular filling defects</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last ParaOverride-10">2.&#9;blocked fluorescence</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Vascular filling defects</span> are defects in which ret&#173;i&#173;nal or choroidal vessels fail to fill &#173;because of an intravascular obstruction that results in nonperfusion of an artery, vein, or capillary. &#173;These defects appear as &#173;either a delay in or complete absence of filling of the involved vessels. <span class="italic">Blocked fluorescence</span> occurs when the stimulation or visualization of the fluorescein is obstructed by fibrous tissue, pigment, or blood that blocks normal ret&#173;i&#173;nal or choroidal fluorescence in the area. The depth of a lesion can be easily determined by relating the level of the blocked fluorescence to details of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal circulation. For example, if lesions block the choroidal circulation, but ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels are present on top of this blocking defect, then the lesions are located above the choroid and below the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Hype</span><span class="italic">r</span>fluorescence occurs when the fluorescence is abnormally excessive, typically extending beyond the borders of recognized structures; this manifests in a few major patterns:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-11">leakage</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">staining</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">pooling</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid">transmission, or win&#173;dow, defect</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-12">autofluorescence</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Leakage,</span> which is a gradual, marked increase in fluorescence over the course of the study, results from the seepage of fluorescein molecules across the blood–&#173;retina barrier. When the outer blood–&#173;retina barrier is compromised, the dye traverses across the pigment epithelium into the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space or neurosensory ret&#173;ina. When the inner blood–&#173;retina barrier is compromised, the dye leaks through vascular walls into the ret&#173;i&#173;nal parenchyma, fibrotic tissue, and cystoid spaces. Dye can also leak through the posterior blood–&#173;retina barrier (the RPE) and accumulate in the subret&#173;i&#173;nal space, fibrotic tissue, or directly into the ret&#173;ina, if the external limiting membrane of the ret&#173;ina is compromised.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Staining</span> refers to a pattern of hyperfluorescence in which the fluorescence increases in intensity through transit views, and persists in late views, but in which the borders remain intact throughout the study. Staining results from fluorescein entry into a solid tissue or material that retains the fluorescein, such as a scar, drusen, optic nerve tissue, or sclera.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Pooling</span> refers to the accumulation of fluorescein in a fluid-&#173;filled space in the ret&#173;ina or choroid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-8</span>). As fluorescein leaks into the space, the margins of the space trap the fluorescein and appear distinct, for example, as seen in an RPE detachment in central serous chorioretinopathy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A <span class="italic">transmission defect,</span> or <span class="italic">win&#173;dow defect,</span> refers to a view of the normal choroidal fluorescence through a defect in the pigment of the RPE. In a transmission defect, hyperfluo&#173;rescence occurs early, corresponding to filling of the choroidal circulation, and reaches its greatest intensity with the peak of choroidal filling. The fluorescence does not increase in intensity or shape and usually fades in the late phases as the choroidal fluorescence becomes diluted by blood that does not contain fluorescein. The fluorescein remains in the choroid and does not enter the ret&#173;i&#173;na.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Multiple defects may be pres&#173;ent in a diseased eye. For example, in an el&#173;derly patient with CNV, the choroid &#173;will often show segmental filling delays; &#173;there &#173;will be hyperfluorescence in the fovea &#173;because of the proliferation of vessels that leak; and &#173;there &#173;will be late leakage from CNV (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-9</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Fluorescein angiography has traditionally been imaged with a fundus camera or an SLO that had a field of view up to about 50°. &#173;There are also wide-&#173;angle scanning &#173;laser systems that are able to image most of the fundus, including the periphery (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-10</span>).</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-13"><span class="h4-head">Adverse effects of fluorescein angiography</span> All patients injected with fluorescein experience a temporary yellowing of the skin and conjunctiva that lasts 6–12 hours. The most common adverse effects include nausea and vomiting (in approximately 5% of injections) and the development of hives (also in approximately 5% of injections). The nausea &#173;will pass in a few seconds without treatment. Hives, &#173;unless very mild, are usually treated with diphenhydramine. More serious adverse effects such as hypotension, shock, laryngeal spasm, or even death have occurred, but only in rare instances. Prior urticarial reactions increase a patient’s risk of having a similar reaction &#173;after subsequent injections; however, premedicating the individual with antihistamines, corticosteroids, or both appears to decrease the risk. Extravasation of the dye into the skin during injection can be painful, requiring application of ice-&#173;cold compresses to the affected area for 5–10 minutes. Close follow-up of the patient over hours or days &#173;until the edema, pain, and redness resolve is advised. Although teratogenic effects have <span class="italic">not</span> been identified, many ophthalmologists avoid using FA in pregnant &#173;women in the first trimester &#173;unless absolutely necessary. In lactating &#173;women, fluorescein is transmitted to breast milk.</p>

			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-13">Indocyanine green angiography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Indocyanine green (ICG) is a water-&#173;soluble, tricarbocyanine dye that is almost completely protein-&#173;bound (98%) &#173;after intravenous injection. &#173;Because the dye is protein-&#173;bound, diffusion through the small fenestrations of the choriocapillaris is limited. The intravascular retention of ICG, coupled with low permeability, makes ICG angiography ideal for imaging choroidal vessels. ICG is metabolized in the liver and excreted into the bile. Both the excitation (790–805&#160;nm) and emission peak (825–835&#160;nm) are in the near-&#173;infrared range. &#173;Because its fluorescence efficacy is low, practical ICG angiography can only be performed with digital sensors.</p>
			<p class="body-text">ICG angiography is used to image polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, which is a common form of choroidal neovascularization (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 2-11</span>), and to provide impor&#173;tant information about the pathophysiology of type 3 neovascularization (also known as ret&#173;i&#173;nal angiomatous proliferation). With the use of ICG angiography, it was discovered that patients with drusen could have asymptomatic choroidal neovascularization. ICG angiography may also be used to help diagnose inflammatory diseases such as birdshot chorioretinopathy, multifocal choroiditis, and panuveitis. Eyes with central serous chorioretinopathy show multifocal areas of choroidal vascular hyperpermeability when visualized with ICG angiography. However, the use of ICG angiography to diagnose uveitis or central serous chorioretinopathy has been mostly supplanted by the use of a combination of autofluorescence imaging with enhanced depth imaging (EDI) OCT.</p>
			<p class="h4-text ParaOverride-14"><span class="h4-head">Adverse effects of indocyanine green angiography</span> Mild adverse events occur in fewer than 1% of patients. ICG is dissolved in a 5% sodium iodide (an additive used in &#173;table salt) solution. &#173;There is no reason to suspect that a shellfish allergy should preclude the use of ICG. However, angiographic facilities should have emergency plans and establish protocols to manage complications associated with &#173;either fluorescein or ICG administration, including anaphylaxis. ICG may persist in the blood longer in patients with liver disease.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Ultrasonography</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Contact B-&#173;scan ultrasonography is the most common form of ultrasonography used in the clinic. In contact B-&#173;scan ultrasonography, a 10-&#173;MHz probe is placed on the patient’s eyelid. A piezoelectric crystal is used to send and receive sound waves for each A-&#173;scan. The ultrasound beam is about 1&#160;mm wide at the level of the ret&#173;ina, which severely limits the lateral resolution. The axial resolution, which is the resolution along the axis of the ultrasound beam, is very dif&#173;fer&#173;ent in the eye versus as mea&#173;sured with flat surfaces. This difference is due to the interaction of the eye’s curved surfaces with the lateral summation of the signal. Contact B-&#173;scan ultrasonography is used to evaluate tumor thickness, detect foreign bodies, assess choroidal or ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments, and analyze the vitreous. Drusen of the optic nerve head can be detected by observing small areas of bright reflection in the nerve that cause shadows. Careful ultrasonography is able to detect ret&#173;i&#173;nal tears. Ultrasonography also has the ability to image the eye during saccades, &#173;because the imaging &#173;doesn’t have to occur through the pupil. Information gained during dynamic examinations is helpful when examining the vitreous and in differentiating retinoschisis from true detachment. Contact B-&#173;scan ultrasonography can produce images through opaque media (<span class="xref-figure">Figs 2-12 and 2-13; Videos 2-1 and 2-2</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ultrasound biomicroscopy uses higher frequencies and thus offers higher resolution images, but at the cost of decreased tissue penetration depth. The probe, typically 50&#160;MHz, is contained inside a soft, water-&#173;filled bag that is placed against the patient’s eye. Ultrasound biomicroscopy is used to evaluate the anterior chamber and ciliary body; it can also be used to visualize the vitreous insertion anteriorly. Typical uses in a ret&#173;i&#173;nal practice include the evaluation of tumors, iris cysts, foreign bodies, anterior suprachoroidal effusions, cyclodialysis clefts, intraocular lens placement, and hyphemas.</p>

					<p class="sidebar-title ParaOverride-16">Optical Coherence Tomography Technologies: <br />A Comparison of SD-&#173;OCT and SS-&#173;OCT</p>
					<p class="sidebar-text--no-indent-">In SD-&#173;OCT, a broad-&#173;spectrum light source is used, and the resulting interferogram varies with the reflectivity of the tissue, which depends on how far that reflecting surface is from the same distance in the reference arm; this imaging focal point is known as the zero-&#173;delay line. Thus, in SD-&#173;OCT the interferogram has frequency encoding of depth; a Fourier transform can be used to calculate the amount of reflectivity and its depth in the tissue. However, the ability of SD-&#173;OCT to detect the interferogram decreases at higher frequencies; deeper structures can be visualized, but not as effectively. A variation on this technique, enhanced depth imaging (EDI) OCT, places the zero-&#173;delay line at the deepest part of the tissue being evaluated. Deeper structures may be better visualized, but at the expense of seeing the more superficial structures. In conventional SD-&#173;OCT, the peak sensitivity is placed in the vitreous, making it pos&#173;si&#173;ble to visualize a structure with very low reflectivity. The choroid is not visualized well with this approach. EDI-&#173;OCT is able to image the choroid, but the vitreous is not visualized well. Therefore, the clinician must choose the most appropriate imaging modality according to the situation in order to obtain an optimal image from the desired level.</p>
					<p class="sidebar-text">In swept-&#173;source (SS) OCT, a light source sequentially scans through successive wavelengths of light across a spectral range. Over time, each sweep of light builds an interferogram. The light sources currently available are based on microelectromechanical systems, which are small and </p>
					<p class="figure-caption ParaOverride-17"><span class="figure-caption-bold CharOverride-2">(continued)</span></p>
					<p class="sidebar-text ParaOverride-18">fast. The disadvantages to using physical methods to obtain a swept &#173;laser output include phase jitter and mode hopping. Coming to market in the near &#173;future is a new light source, called an akinetic &#173;laser, which uses electronic means to sweep wavelengths, thereby avoiding the mechanical method of selecting wavelengths. The akinetic &#173;laser reduces phase jitter and is able to select narrow regions of light wavelengths; with &#173;these abilities, systems may soon be able to scan the entire depth of the eye, from cornea to choroid, in 1 scan.</p>
					<p class="sidebar-text">SS-&#173;OCT systems display &#173;little change in sensitivity with increasing depth. Therefore, it is not necessary to choose &#173;whether to highlight the vitreous or choroid in an image, &#173;because both can be imaged well si&#173;mul&#173;ta&#173;neously. With improvements in spectrometers, SD-&#173;OCT systems might have lower amounts of sensitivity fall-&#173;off with increased depth and thus may remain competitive in the marketplace. SS-&#173;OCT is generally done at somewhat longer wavelengths &#173;because of the availability of light sources. The longer wavelengths help visualize deeper structures, with a slight trade-&#173;off in decreased lateral resolution (remember, the smallest spot size is related to wavelength).</p>
					<p class="sidebar-text">Fi&#173;nally, SD-&#173;OCT systems use a line-&#173;charge coupled device to detect the interferogram &#173;after it has passed through a diffraction grating. The detector’s sensitivity and response time are the major determinants of the device’s scan speed. In SS-&#173;OCT, the detector is the relatively &#173;simple and high-&#173;speed photodiode, and the scan speeds can be quite fast. However, &#173;because safety standards limit the amount of light used in the eye, higher-&#173;speed imaging often comes at the expense of decreased signal-&#173;to-&#173;noise ratio. Faster scan speeds are good for area coverage and reduced imaging time, but they are a disadvantage in terms of noise.</p>
