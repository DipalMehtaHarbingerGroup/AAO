			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">This chapter focuses on posterior segment injuries; therefore, lamellar lacerations and superficial foreign bodies are not discussed &#173;here.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Microsurgical techniques have improved the ability to repair corneal and scleral lacerations, and vitrectomy techniques allow management of severe intraocular injuries (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;20&#160;in this volume</span>). Ocular trauma is also discussed in BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus;</span> Section&#160;7, <span class="italic">Orbit, Eyelids, and Lacrimal System;</span> and Section&#160;8, <span class="italic">External Disease and Cornea.</span></p>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Evaluation of the Patient After Ocular Trauma</p>
			<div id="Chapt18_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the initial evaluation of an ocular injury, the clinician should try to determine &#173;whether the injury is closed globe or open globe, and &#173;whether an intraocular foreign body (IOFB) is pres&#173;ent. The evaluation includes obtaining a complete history, or as complete as pos&#173;si&#173;ble &#173;under the circumstances, which is crucial before a patient with ocular trauma is examined (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;18-1</span>), and performing a thorough examination. During the examination, caution is required to avoid exacerbating the damage; for example, attempting to pry open the eye of an uncooperative patient is inadvisable. If pos&#173;si&#173;ble, the clinician should mea&#173;sure the visual acuity of each eye separately and evaluate the pupils for an afferent pupillary defect. To the extent pos&#173;si&#173;ble, external, slit-&#173;lamp, and fundus examination should be performed and intraocular pressure (IOP) should be mea&#173;sured. Severe chemosis, ecchymosis, eyelid edema, low IOP, the presence of an entrance wound, iris damage or incarceration, cataract, or other anterior segment pathology may suggest an ocular rupture or laceration. Normal IOP and/or absence of findings on examination do not exclude an occult penetration of the globe.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If an open-&#173;globe injury is suspected but cannot be confirmed based on findings, or if lack of patient cooperation prevents a thorough examination in the clinical setting (eg, when examining a child), a thorough examination with pos&#173;si&#173;ble surgical exploration should be performed &#173;under general anesthesia in the operating room. Optimally, the patient’s consent should be obtained for immediate repair following this examination and surgical exploration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular imaging can help assess the status of the injured eye and facilitate detection of an IOFB, particularly in the presence of media opacities. In the acute setting, the 2 most helpful imaging systems are <span class="italic">ocular ultrasonography</span> (B-&#173;scan) and <span class="italic">computed tomography (CT)</span> of the eye and orbits. When an ocular ultrasound examination is performed, care must be taken to avoid causing ocular compression, which may lead to expulsion of intraocular &#173;matter. It is advisable to perform the ultrasound through the patient’s closed lids, aided by copious amounts of ultrasound gel. B-&#173;scan ultrasonography can be particularly helpful in detecting nonradiopaque IOFBs, such as wood and plastic. Signs of a scleral rupture that are vis&#173;i&#173;ble on ultrasonography include the entrapment of vitreous strands into the rupture site. Intraocular air may cause image artifacts that complicate the interpretation of ultrasonography.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Bone-&#173;free <span class="italic">plain-&#173;film x-&#173;ray studies</span> may be helpful, but &#173;these are less sensitive than ultrasonograms for detecting smaller IOFBs. CT is very helpful in detecting radiopaque IOFBs; however, very dense IOFBs may introduce image artifacts that cause them to appear larger than they &#173;really are, making exact localization difficult. Although <span class="italic">magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</span> is not usually used in the acute setting, it can be helpful in detecting detailed ocular anatomy and in identifying the presence and location of IOFBs, including &#173;those that are not radiopaque. However, MRI should be used only &#173;after the presence of ferromagnetic foreign bodies has been definitively ruled out, due to the possibility that the magnetic field may move such foreign bodies, causing additional damage.</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;16</span> for discussion of traumatic ret&#173;i&#173;nal breaks and ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment and Chapter&#160;20 for discussion of choroidal hemorrhage. Sequelae of the posterior segment are discussed in the following sections.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-6">Commotio Ret&#173;i&#173;nae</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The term <span class="italic">commotio ret&#173;i&#173;nae</span> refers to damage to the outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal layers caused by shock waves that traverse the eye from the site of impact following blunt trauma. Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals a sheenlike ret&#173;i&#173;nal whitening that appears some hours &#173;after the injury (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-1</span>). This ret&#173;i&#173;nal whitening occurs most commonly in the posterior pole but may also be found peripherally. Spectral-&#173;domain optical coherence tomography (SD-&#173;OCT) findings suggest that the major site of disruption is in the photoreceptor and ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE) layers, resulting in the observed ret&#173;i&#173;nal opacification. With foveal involvement, a cherry-&#173;red spot may appear &#173;because the cells involved in the whitening are not pres&#173;ent in the foveola. Commotio ret&#173;i&#173;nae in the posterior pole may decrease visual acuity to as low as 20/200. Gradual visual recovery may occur if &#173;there is no associated macular pigment epitheliopathy, choroidal rupture, or macular hole formation.</p>
			<p class="h2">Choroidal Rupture</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">When the eye is compressed along its anterior–&#173;posterior axis, tears may occur in Bruch membrane, which has &#173;little elasticity, as well as in the overlying RPE and fibrous tissue around the choriocapillaris. Adjacent subret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage is common. Choroidal ruptures may be single or multiple and occur typically in the periphery and concentric to the optic nerve head (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-2</span>). Ruptures that extend through the fovea may cause permanent vision loss. &#173;There is no effective treatment.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Occasionally, choroidal neovascularization (CNV) develops as a late complication &#173;after damage to Bruch membrane (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-3</span>). A patient with a choroidal rupture near the macula should be alerted to the risk of CNV. Subfoveal CNV, if pres&#173;ent, is generally treated with a vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (VEGF) inhibitor. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;4 of this volume</span> for information on the management of CNV.</p>
			<p class="h2">Posttraumatic Macular Hole</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Blunt trauma may cause a full-&#173;thickness macular hole by vari&#173;ous mechanisms, including contusion necrosis and vitreous traction. Holes may be observed immediately &#173;after blunt trauma that &#173;causes severe commotio ret&#173;i&#173;nae, following a submacular hemorrhage caused by a choroidal rupture (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-4</span>), or &#173;after a whiplash separation of the vitreous from the ret&#173;ina. In addition, central depressions, or macular pits (similar to &#173;those observed in patients &#173;after sun gazing), have been described following blunt trauma to the eye and whiplash injuries. Lightning and electrical injury can also cause macular holes; patients with &#173;these injuries usually have signs of cataract and can have acute peripapillary ret&#173;i&#173;nal whitening. Posttraumatic macular holes may close spontaneously or may be successfully closed surgically. Depending on the degree of collateral damage to the fovea, visual acuity recovery varies greatly.</p>
			<p class="h2">Vitreous Hemorrhage</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Vitreous hemorrhage is a common sequela of ocular trauma. &#173;Because a hemorrhage that is loculated at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion can &#173;later become diffuse, a determination of the cause of the hemorrhage should always be undertaken as soon as pos&#173;si&#173;ble. Bed rest with elevation of the head may enable the hemorrhage to &#173;settle sufficiently to allow for a more detailed ophthalmoscopic examination. If vitreous hemorrhage obscures the view of the posterior segment, B-scan or radiologic ocular imaging should be considered.</p>
			<p class="h2">Traumatic Chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal Disruption (Ret&#173;i&#173;nal Sclopetaria)</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An unusual ret&#173;i&#173;nal pathology can be produced by high-&#173;speed projectile injuries to the orbit. Large areas of choroidal and ret&#173;i&#173;nal disruption combine with extensive subret&#173;i&#173;nal, ret&#173;i&#173;nal, or vitreous hemorrhage. As the blood resorbs, the injured area is repaired by extensive scar formation and widespread pigmentary alteration (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-5</span>, see also Fig 18-4). If the macula is involved, &#173;there is significant loss of vision. Secondary ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment rarely develops. The pattern of damage is ascribed to shock waves generated by the deceleration of the projectile passing close to the sclera. Blunt trauma due to injuries from paintballs or other projectiles may produce a similar fundus appearance.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-7">Open-Globe Injuries</p>
			<div id="Chapt18_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Open-&#173;globe injuries generally have a guarded prognosis regarding visual acuity outcomes (see the section Prognostication of Globe Injuries &#173;later in this chapter). The development of a ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment is common; the detachment is usually caused by the primary injury or by traction resulting from proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). In all cases of open-&#173;globe injuries, the presence of an intraocular foreign body should be ruled out.</p>
			<p class="h2">Scleral Rupture</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Severe blunt injuries can rupture the globe. Rupture injuries can be very severe; &#173;there is often expulsion of intraocular content (to varying degrees). The 2 most common locations for rupture are the limbus, particularly through previous surgical wounds, or through areas of physiological scleral thinning parallel to and &#173;under the insertions of the rectus muscles. Impor&#173;tant diagnostic signs of rupture include a marked decrease in ocular ductions, very boggy conjunctival chemosis with hemorrhage (ecchymosis), deepened anterior chamber, and severe vitreous hemorrhage. The IOP is usually very low but may be normal or even elevated.</p>
			<p class="h2">Lacerating and Penetrating Injuries</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Lacerating injuries result from cutting or tearing of the eyewall by objects of varying sharpness. A penetrating injury of the globe is a laceration of the eyewall at a single entry site. The prognosis is related to the location and extent of the wound, as well as the associated damage and degree of hemorrhage.</p>
			<p class="h2">Perforating Injuries</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A globe-&#173;perforating injury has both entrance and exit wounds. Globe-&#173;perforating injuries may be caused by objects of varying sharpness such as &#173;needles, knives, high-&#173;velocity pellets, or small fragments of metal. An impor&#173;tant iatrogenic cause is needle perforation during retrobulbar or peribulbar anesthesia for intraocular surgery. Studies have shown that, &#173;after perforating injuries, fibrous proliferation occurs along the scaffold of damaged vitreous between the entrance and exit wounds. The wounds are often closed by fibrosis within 5–7 days &#173;after the injury, depending on wound size. Small-&#173;gauge injuries with only&#160;a&#160;small&#160;amount of hemorrhage and no significant collateral damage often heal without serious sequelae.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-8">Surgical Management</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In most instances, primary repair of open-&#173;globe injuries consists of suturing of the corneal and scleral wounds. Although &#173;there are some theoretical reasons for performing an early vitrectomy, the priority at the time of the acute injury is to close the globe. Primary wound closure should not be delayed, particularly &#173;because closure &#173;will facilitate a &#173;later vitrectomy if it is needed. For more on vitrectomy, see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;20&#160;in this volume</span>. Open-&#173;globe trauma surgery is best performed with the patient &#173;under general anesthesia, &#173;because injection of local anesthetics into the orbit can cause compression of the globe and expulsion of intraocular content.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Primary repair</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The princi&#173;ples of primary repair of open-&#173;globe injuries include careful, gentle microsurgical corneoscleral wound repair, during which incarcerated uvea is reposited or excised. If a laceration crosses the limbus, or if &#173;there is any suspicion of a scleral laceration or rupture, a gentle and generous peritomy, usually 360°, should be performed for best pos&#173;si&#173;ble exposure. Corneal lacerations may be closed with 10-0 nylon interrupted sutures, and scleral wounds may be closed with stronger 7-0, 8-0, or 9-0 nonabsorbable sutures. Vitreous should be excised from the wound and the anterior chamber should be reformed. Any uvea or ret&#173;ina that protrudes should be amputated if contaminated or &#173;gently reposited into the eye. Chapter&#160;2 of BCSC Section&#160;4, <span class="italic">Ophthalmic Pathology and Intraocular Tumors,</span> discusses wound healing in detail.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any scleral laceration must be explored &#173;until its posterior extent has been located. If no laceration or rupture can be seen, and a posterior rupture is suspected, a meticulous scleral exploration, including under&#173;neath the rectus muscles, should be performed. This may necessitate disinserting one or more extraocular muscles to achieve adequate exposure. If the wound is very posterior, the site should be left to heal without suturing; attempts to suture very posterior wounds may result in expulsion of intraocular content. Some ophthalmologists advocate for placing a prophylactic encircling scleral buckle at the time of primary repair to reduce the likelihood of a &#173;later ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment.</p>
			<p class="h3 ParaOverride-9">Immediate vitrectomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Immediate vitrectomy may be necessary or advisable in some circumstances—&#173;for example, if evaluation suggests the possibility of an IOFB or endophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Some surgeons &#173;favor immediate vitrectomy at the time of the primary repair, before cellular proliferation (proliferative vitreoretinopathy) begins. Inducing a posterior vitreous detachment and thorough dissection of the vitreous removes some of the scaffold on which contractile membranes grow. This may reduce the risk of late complications such as tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachments, cyclitic membrane formation, and phthisis bulbi. Separating the posterior cortical vitreous from the ret&#173;ina may be difficult, especially in &#173;children, young adults, and in eyes with ret&#173;i&#173;nal breaks or ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. If the injury is perforating, the posterior wound may pres&#173;ent challenges &#173;because it may leak infusate, making the maintenance of IOP during surgery difficult.</p>
			<p class="h3">Delayed vitrectomy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most prac&#173;ti&#173;tion&#173;ers in the United States prefer initially performing a primary repair of the wound(s) to restore the globe and IOP, followed by delayed vitrectomy, if needed. Reasons that support of delayed vitrectomy include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2">decreasing the risk of intraoperative hemorrhage in eyes that are acutely inflamed and congested</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-2">allowing the cornea to clear and improve intraoperative visualization</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-2">permitting spontaneous separation of the vitreous from the ret&#173;ina, which facilitates a safer and more complete vitrectomy</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-2">allowing posterior wounds in perforating injuries to heal, so &#173;there is ocular integrity during vitrectomy</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The optimal timing of vitrectomy following primary repair remains controversial. It may be best to perform vitrectomy 2–14 days following primary repair. Many advocate waiting at least 5 days if &#173;there are unsutured (posterior) wounds. Vitrectomy that is delayed more than 2 weeks following the injury may contribute to substantial worsening of proliferative vitreoretinopathy and associated worse anatomic and visual outcomes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Typical indications for vitrectomy may include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2">the presence of moderate to severe vitreous hemorrhage</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-2">other tissue damage that requires repair</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-2">phacoanaphylactic uveitis, which may occur if the lens is damaged</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-2">signs of developing transvitreal traction</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-2">ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment<p class="reference--journal--first ParaOverride-10">Kuhn&#160;F.

			</ul>
			</div>
			<p class="h1">Intraocular Foreign Bodies</p>
			<div id="Chapt18_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An IOFB should always be suspected and ruled out in cases of ocular or orbital trauma. In most cases, an IOFB is &#173;either observed, or it is suggested by the presence of an entry site or the reported mechanism of injury. A detailed history helps the clinician assess the likelihood of the presence of an IOFB. As previously discussed, ocular imaging can be very helpful in the detection of IOFBs (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-6</span>). If surgical removal of an IOFB cannot be accomplished promptly, intravitreal injection of antimicrobial agents should be considered to minimize the risk of endophthalmitis developing.</p>
			<p class="h3">Surgical techniques for removal of intraocular foreign bodies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the case of a magnetic IOFB, surgical planning should address the following issues:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2">location of the foreign body in the eye</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-2">surgeon’s ability to visualize and localize the foreign body</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-2">size and shape of the foreign body</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-2">composition of the foreign body (ferromagnetic vs nonferromagnetic)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-2">encapsulation of the foreign body</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Pars plana vitrectomy allows removal of traumatized vitreous and facilitates controlled microsurgical extraction of IOFBs as well as media opacities such as cataract and hemorrhage (<span class="xref-figure">Video 18-1</span>). Before forceps extraction is attempted, the IOFB should be freed of all attachments. A small rare-&#173;earth magnet may be used to engage and separate the foreign body from the ret&#173;i&#173;nal surface. Although small foreign bodies can be removed through enlargement of the pars plana sclerotomy site, it may be safer to extract some large foreign bodies through the corneoscleral limbus or the initial wound to minimize collateral damage.</p>

			<p class="h3">Retained intraocular foreign bodies</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The reaction of the eye to a retained foreign body varies widely and depends on the object’s chemical composition, sterility, and location. Inert, sterile foreign bodies such as stone, sand, glass, porcelain, plastic, and cilia are generally well tolerated. If such material is found several days &#173;after the injury and does not appear to create an inflammatory reaction, it may be left in place, provided it is not obstructing vision.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Zinc, aluminum, copper, and iron are metals that are commonly reactive in the eye. Of &#173;these, zinc and aluminum tend to cause minimal inflammation and may become encapsulated. However, any very large foreign body may incite inflammation and thereby cause proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Epiret&#173;i&#173;nal proliferations, tractional ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, and phthisis bulbi may result in complete loss of vision. Migration of the foreign body also can occur, especially if it contains copper.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Chalcosis</span> Pure copper is especially toxic and &#173;causes acute <span class="italic">chalcosis.</span> Prompt removal is required to prevent severe inflammation that may lead to loss of the eye. Foreign bodies with a copper content of less than 85% (eg, brass, bronze) may cause <span class="italic">chronic chalcosis</span>. Typical findings in chronic chalcosis are deposits in Descemet membrane (a sign similar to the Kayser-&#173;Fleischer ring in Wilson disease and the result of copper’s affinity for basement membranes), greenish aqueous particles, green discoloration of the iris, lens capsule (“sunflower” cataract), brownish-&#173;red vitreous opacities and strand formation, and metallic flecks on ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels and the internal limiting membrane in the macular region. Late removal of copper may not cure the chalcosis; in fact, dissemination of the metal during surgery may worsen the inflammatory response.</p>
			<p class="h4-text"><span class="h4-head">Siderosis bulbi</span> In <span class="italic">siderosis bulbi,</span> iron from IOFBs is deposited primarily in neuroepithelial tissues such as the iris sphincter and dilator muscles, the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium, the lens epithelium (see BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract,</span> <span class="xref-figure-local">Chapter&#160;5, Fig 5-14</span>), the ret&#173;ina, and the RPE. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal photoreceptors and RPE cells are especially susceptible to damage from iron (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;18-2</span>). Electroretinography (ERG) changes in eyes with early siderosis include an increased a-&#173;wave and normal b-&#173;wave, a progressively diminishing b-&#173;wave amplitude over time, and eventually an undetectable signal during the final stage of iron toxicity of the ret&#173;ina. Serial ERGs can be helpful in monitoring eyes with small retained foreign bodies. If the b-&#173;wave amplitude decreases, removal of the foreign body is generally recommended.</p>

			<p class="h1">Posttraumatic Endophthalmitis</p>
			<div id="Chapt18_Top5">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Endophthalmitis occurs following 2%–7% of penetrating injuries; the incidence is higher in association with IOFBs and in rural settings. Posttraumatic endophthalmitis can pro&#173;gress rapidly; its clinical signs include marked inflammation featuring hypopyon, fibrin, vitreous infiltration, and corneal opacification. The risk of endophthalmitis occurring &#173;after penetrating ocular injury may be reduced by prompt wound closure and early removal&#160;of IOFBs. Use of prophylactic subconjunctival, intravenous, or intravitreal antibiotics is often recommended. Intravitreal or periocular aminoglycoside antibiotics should be avoided &#173;because of their high risk of ret&#173;i&#173;nal toxicity. Anterior chamber and vitreous cultures should be obtained, and if endophthalmitis is suspected, antibiotics should be injected.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Bacillus cereus,</span> which rarely &#173;causes endophthalmitis in other settings, accounts for almost 25% of cases of posttraumatic endophthalmitis. Endophthalmitis caused by <span class="italic">B cereus</span> has a rapid and severe course and, once established, leads to profound vision loss and often loss of the eye. Most commonly, <span class="italic">B cereus</span> endophthalmitis is associated with soil-&#173;contaminated injuries, especially &#173;those involving foreign bodies. Gram-&#173;negative organisms are also frequent pathogens in posttraumatic endophthalmitis.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Treatment of posttraumatic endophthalmitis should cover the aforementioned pathogens. &#173;Because recommendations for antibiotic se&#173;lection can change, ophthalmologists should consult a recent reference or an infectious disease specialist.</p>

			<p class="h1">Prognostication of Globe Injuries</p>
			<div id="Chapt18_Top6">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The severity of the damage to the eye and its function at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion have prognostic significance. Given the complexity of ocular trauma and its inherent unpredictable nature, &#173;there is no perfect system for prognostication of ocular injuries. However, some specific &#173;factors have been determined to have prognostic importance. Functional assessments include evaluating visual acuity and &#173;whether an afferent pupillary defect is pres&#173;ent, and noting the injury descriptors, specifically the type of trauma and the zone of injury. The Ocular Trauma Score assigns a point value based on &#173;these assessments (<span class="xref-table">&#173;Table&#160;18-3</span>). In this system, visual acuity is the most impor&#173;tant predictor of injury severity; other characteristics are assigned a negative point value that is subtracted from the visual acuity score to produce the total raw score. The higher the raw score, the better the final visual acuity prognosis (see &#173;Table&#160;18-3). This system is a useful general guide to roughly estimate visual acuity outcomes following globe trauma.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-12">Sympathetic Ophthalmia</p>			
			<div id="Chapt18_Top7">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare complication of penetrating ocular trauma in which the fellow, uninjured eye develops a severe autoimmune inflammatory reaction. Removing an injured eye is thought to reduce the very small risk of sympathetic ophthalmia, especially if it is done by 14 days &#173;after the injury. Thus, some advocate for prompt enucleation of eyes without vision (no light perception). &#173;Others advise against the removal of eye, &#173;because the disorder is extremely rare and treatable, and superior cosmetic and psychological outcomes are achieved with globe retention. Sympathetic ophthalmia is discussed in more detail in BCSC Section&#160;9, <span class="italic">Intraocular Inflammation and Uveitis.</span></p>

			<p class="h1">Avulsion of the Optic Nerve Head</p>
			<div id="Chapt18_Top8">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A forceful backward dislocation of the optic nerve from the scleral canal can occur &#173;under several circumstances, including</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2">extreme rotation and forward displacement of the globe</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-2">penetrating orbital injury, causing a backward pull on the optic nerve</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-2">sudden increase in IOP, causing rupture of the lamina cribrosa</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Total loss of vision characteristically occurs. Findings may vary from a pitlike depression of the optic nerve head to posterior hemorrhage and contusion necrosis (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-7</span>); however, hemorrhage is usually pres&#173;ent acutely. A B-&#173;scan ultrasound may reveal a hypoechoic defect in the area of the posterior scleral defect in the region of the optic nerve (ON). Cross-&#173;sectional neuroimaging may also be helpful in making the diagnosis.</p>

			<p class="h1">Abusive Head Trauma</p>		
			<div id="Chapt18_Top9">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Severe shaking of infants, a form of nonaccidental trauma, is the cause of abusive head trauma (formerly known as <span class="italic">shaken baby syndrome</span>). The typical baby with abusive head trauma is almost always younger than 1 year and is frequently younger than 6 months. The presenting sign of child abuse involves the eye in approximately 5% of cases. Any physician who suspects that child abuse might have occurred is required by law in &#173;every US state and Canadian province to report the incident to a designated government agency.</p>
			<p class="body-text">See BCSC Section&#160;6, <span class="italic">Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus,</span> for discussion of the multiple systemic symptoms associated with abusive head trauma. Ocular signs include</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-list-first ParaOverride-2">ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages and cotton-&#173;wool spots (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-8</span>)</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-mid ParaOverride-2">retinal folds</li>
				<li class="bullet-list-last ParaOverride-2">hemorrhagic schisis cavities</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="body-text">The ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages associated with abusive head trauma often have a hemispheric contour. They can begin to resolve very rapidly, so it is impor&#173;tant to examine suspected cases on pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion. The retinopathy may resemble that observed in Terson syndrome or central ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion, neither of which is common in infants. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages may be caused by trauma, but they are not usually associated with typical accidents, such as falls in the home.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage should be considered if amblyopia is likely to occur but may be deferred if a bright-&#173;flash ERG response shows loss of the b-&#173;wave, which is indicative of extensive ret&#173;i&#173;nal damage. Fluorescein angiography shows attenuated vasculature and avascularity of the periphery.</p>

			<p class="h1">Photic Damage</p>
			<div id="Chapt18_Top10">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The eye has several mechanisms to protect itself against light damage, including pupil constriction, light absorption by melanin in the RPE, and the presence of antioxidants, such as lutein and zeaxanthin, in the macula. Light injures the ret&#173;ina by 3 basic mechanisms: (1) mechanical, (2) thermal, and (3) photochemical. <span class="italic">Mechanical injury</span> occurs when the power of the absorbed light is high enough to form gas or &#173;water vapor or to produce acoustic shock waves that mechanically disrupt ret&#173;i&#173;nal tissues. The absorbed energy may be enough to strip electrons from molecules in the target tissue, producing a collection of ions and electrons referred to as <span class="italic">plasma.</span> For example, a Q-&#173;switched Nd:YAG &#173;laser produces its therapeutic effect through mechanical light damage and uses this effect to disrupt a cloudy posterior capsule &#173;behind an intraocular lens.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Thermal injury</span> occurs when excessive light absorption by the RPE and surrounding structures &#173;causes local elevation of the tissue temperature, leading to coagulation, inflammation, and scarring of the RPE and the surrounding neurosensory ret&#173;ina and choroid. A therapeutic application of thermal light injury is the ret&#173;i&#173;nal burn caused by &#173;laser photocoagulation. See <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;19</span> for discussion of photocoagulation.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Photochemical injury</span> results from biochemical reactions that cause ret&#173;i&#173;nal tissue destruction without elevation of temperature. It is the result of the transfer of light energy to a molecule; the excess energy initiates reactions that cause tissue damage. Damaging reactions can include oxidation, photoisomerization, photochemical cleavage, and electrocyclic reactions. Such changes occur primarily at the level of the outer segments of the photoreceptors, which are more sensitive than the inner segments. Examples of photochemical injury are solar retinopathy and photic retinopathy that occurs &#173;after excessive exposure to illumination from an operating microscope.</p>

			<p class="h2">Solar Retinopathy</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Solar retinopathy, also known as <span class="italic">foveomacular retinitis, eclipse retinopathy,</span> or <span class="italic">solar retinitis,</span> is a thermally enhanced photochemical ret&#173;i&#173;nal injury caused by direct or indirect gazing at the sun; it may also occur &#173;after viewing a solar eclipse without proper protection. The extent of the damage depends on the duration and intensity of the exposure. Younger patients with clearer lenses are at a higher risk of solar retinopathy. Symptoms include decreased vision, central scotomas, dyschromatopsia, metamorphopsia, micropsia, and frontal or temporal headache within hours of exposure. Visual acuity is typically reduced to 20/25–20/100 but may be worse depending on the degree of exposure. Most patients recover within 3–6 months, with visual acuity returning to the level of 20/20–20/40, but &#173;there may be residual metamorphopsia and paracentral scotomas. Typical findings include a central opacified area of the fovea acutely and depigmentation &#173;after the acute changes resolve (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 18-9</span>). No known beneficial treatment exists, and therefore prevention through education is critically impor&#173;tant.</p>

High-&#173;resolution optical coherence tomography findings in solar maculopathy and the differential diagnosis of outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal holes. <span class="italic">Am J Ophthalmol.</span> 2011;152(3):413–419.e6.</p>
			<p class="h2">Phototoxicity From Ophthalmic Instrumentation</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The potential for photochemical damage from exposure to modern ophthalmic instruments has been studied extensively. Injuries have been reported from operating microscopes and from fiber-&#173;optic endoilluminating probes used in vitrectomies. The incidence of photic retinopathy &#173;after con&#173;temporary cataract surgery is not known. However, cases continue to be reported &#173;after intraocular surgery. The incidence increases with prolonged operating times but can occur even with surgery times as short as 30 minutes. In ret&#173;i&#173;nal surgery, photic injury is more likely to occur with prolonged, focal exposure, especially when the light probe is held in close proximity to the ret&#173;ina, as it may be during macular hole and epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane procedures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most affected patients are asymptomatic, but some &#173;will notice a paracentral scotoma on the first postoperative day. Depending on the severity of the damage, vision may return to normal &#173;after some time, or it may progressively deteriorate. Acutely affected patients may have a deep, irregular, oval-&#173;shaped, yellow-&#173;white ret&#173;i&#173;nal lesion adjacent to the fovea that resembles the shape of the light source. The lesion typically evolves to become a zone of mottled RPE that transmits background hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Reports of photic macular lesions occurring &#173;after intraocular surgery underscore the need for prevention. During ocular surgery, the risk of photic retinopathy may be reduced by minimizing exposure time, avoiding the use of intense illumination, using oblique illumination when pos&#173;si&#173;ble during parts of the surgery, filtering out short-&#173;wavelength blue light and UV light, and using shielding. BCSC Section&#160;11, <span class="italic">Lens and Cataract,</span> lists several precautions for minimizing ret&#173;i&#173;nal light toxicity. See also BCSC <span class="xref-local">Section&#160;3</span>, <span class="italic">Clinical Optics.</span></p>

			<p class="h2">Occupational Light Toxicity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Occupational exposure to bright lights can lead to ret&#173;i&#173;nal damage. A common cause of this type of occupational injury is arc welding without the use of protective goggles. The damage from the vis&#173;i&#173;ble blue light of the arc welder leads to photochemical damage similar to that observed in solar retinopathy. Occupational injury from stray &#173;laser exposure is also a serious concern.</p>
			<p class="h2">Handheld Laser-&#173;Pointer Injury</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The availability of high-&#173;power green and blue handheld &#173;laser devices has created a serious emerging source of immediate accidental or purposeful sight-&#173;threatening macular injury. &#173;These devices are easily obtainable via the Internet and resemble the much safer, ubiquitous low-&#173;power red &#173;laser pointers. &#173;These devices also pres&#173;ent the risk of causing secondary harmful effects by visually incapacitating &#173;people undertaking visually demanding functions, such as firefighters and airline pi&#173;lots, even if they do not cause ret&#173;i&#173;nal damage.</p>
