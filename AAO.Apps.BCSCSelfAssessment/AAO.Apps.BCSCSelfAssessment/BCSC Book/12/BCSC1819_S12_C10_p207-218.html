			<p class="chapter-title">Myopia and Pathologic Myopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">&#173;There has been an explosion in the prevalence of myopia around the world. Although the more severe manifestations of myopia, variously termed <span class="italic">pathologic myopia</span> or <span class="italic">high myo</span><span class="italic">pia,</span> are found in a smaller proportion of the population, this subset accounts for many of the vi&#173;sion prob&#173;lems that occur in eyes with myopia. Pathologic myopia could be defined as the development of the pathologic changes associated with myopia. Most studies use a myopic refractive error greater than –6 diopters (D) or an axial length of 26.5&#160;mm or more as a threshold for pathologic myopia. However, cutoffs based on refractive error or axial length in which the probability of pathologic changes to occur are increased are not sharp demarcations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Currently, pathologic myopia is found in 1%–2% of individuals in the United States, approximately 5% in Italy, 5%–8% in Japan, 15% in Singapore, and 38% in university students in Taiwan. Many &#173;factors might contribute to the occurrence of myopia; determining a cause has proved difficult as findings from 1 study have not necessarily been replicated in other studies. Numerous studies have been conducted to examine &#173;whether &#173;there are any ge&#173;ne&#173;tic associations to the occurrence of pathologic myopia, but again, &#173;there are no universal findings. Given the rapid and widespread acquisition of myopia, especially pathologic myopia in diverse populations, the development of myopia may be due to ele&#173;ments of emmetropization gone awry. Common &#173;factors among patients with pathologic myopia seem to include a lack of outdoor activities at a young age and are related to concentrated near work. Societal transitions from hunting or agrarian activities to dependence on modern manufacturing or knowledge workers created a generational shift in the proportion of myopic &#173;people. In East Asia, young &#173;people are pressured to do well in examinations to gain entrance into universities, &#173;because gradu&#173;ates of &#173;those universities have desirable well-&#173;paying jobs that also help promote economic and scientific advances for their respective countries. &#173;Because it is highly unlikely any of &#173;these pressures &#173;will abate over the next generations, research into myopia prevention and treatment is a major public health issue. Pathologic myopia and its consequences rank at the top or near the top of the list of &#173;causes of vision decrease or blindness in many countries; with its increase in prevalence, &#173;it will likely become even more impor&#173;tant in the &#173;future.</p>
			<p class="h1">Prevention</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Prevention of pathologic myopia is a complex and evolving topic. Pathologic myopia has only been recognized as a prob&#173;lem relatively recently. The vari&#173;ous animal models may have only limited applicability to &#173;humans; to date, &#173;there have been only limited studies with &#173;human participants. In addition, the epidemiologic data vary. Participation in outdoor activities is thought to be a contributing &#173;factor to in reducing the incidence of myopia; this finding is supported by experimental animal model data showing that periods of blue light exposure decrease the amount of myopia that develops. Some theories posit chromatic aberration in the eye is operative in causing myopia; red light is focused at a deeper level than blue light.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In 1891, Taylor recommended atropine, blue glasses, and the application of leeches for the treatment of progressive myopia. Much &#173;later, McBrien and his coworkers demonstrated that atropine could slow the development of form-&#173;deprivation myopia via a mechanism that was in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent of accommodation. Numerous studies have been conducted using atropine eyedrops, including eyedrops at very low concentrations, with a slight decrease in the amount of myopia that develops. Although the use of leeches has been discontinued, pro&#173;gress since the time of Taylor has been limited in scope and effect (and in fact, we have no data to discount the importance of leeches).</p>

			<div id="Chapt10_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In the central macula, the ret&#173;i&#173;nal thickness in eyes with pathologic myopia is not that dif&#173;fer&#173;ent from that in emmetropic eyes, particularly in younger individuals. In older subjects with marked thinning of the choroid, &#173;there may be loss of the outer ret&#173;i&#173;nal bands and apparent thinning of the central macula (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-1</span>). Outside of the macula, the ret&#173;i&#173;nal thickness in eyes with pathologic myopia is thinner than that in emmetropic eyes. Lattice degeneration is more commonly found in myopic eyes. With increasing age, the vitreous starts to detach in all eyes, starting with smaller areas of detachment bordering areas of attachment; this is also true for myopic eyes. Vitreous traction in areas of per&#173;sis&#173;tent attachment can cause ret&#173;i&#173;nal tears and then detachment, or may even cause subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid to occur in association with small atrophic holes in lattice degeneration. The proportion of ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment secondary to holes as compared with tears increases with more exaggerated amounts of myopia. Repairing ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment may be more difficult in patients with high myopia &#173;because of the thinner ret&#173;i&#173;na; a higher prevalence of lattice degeneration; the thinner sclera, which can complicate buckle placement, the more posterior location of the ret&#173;i&#173;nal breaks, and the possibility of multiple ret&#173;i&#173;nal defects.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Traction on the ret&#173;ina in eyes with larger amounts of myopia can affect broader areas of the ret&#173;ina, in&#173;de&#173;pen&#173;dent of vitreous attachment. The posterior portion of the ret&#173;ina can remain attached to the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE) despite broad areas of traction. Ret&#173;i&#173;nal thickness increases &#173;because of the fluid accumulation within the ret&#173;ina and distention of the cellular ele&#173;ments in the ret&#173;i&#173;na.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Myopic macular schisis most commonly involves Henle fiber layer but can also involve the inner nuclear layer, the ganglion cell layer, and the region under&#173;neath the internal limiting membrane (ILM). The traction can be related to vitreous traction from attached vitreous, but eyes with myopic macular schisis can still have vitreous traction with posterior vitreous detachment (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-2</span>). Myopic macular retinoschisis can occur in eyes with posterior vitreous detachment that, at the time of surgery, are found to have minimal amounts of adherent residual vitreous. &#173;After posterior vitreous detachment, a skim coat of vitreous remains on the surface of the ret&#173;ina and appears to cause traction. Varying amounts of epiret&#173;i&#173;nal membrane may also contribute to the traction. Peeling of the ILM &#173;causes resolution of the schisis, typically near the area where the ILM was peeled, leading to the conclusion the ILM may be altered in eyes with myopic macular retinoschisis. An alternate possibility is that many of &#173;these eyes have progressive myopia with continued ocular expansion. The ILM may not necessarily be remodeled, and thus it may not expand like the outer ret&#173;i&#173;na.</p>
			<p class="body-text">More advanced tractional changes can lead to ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment over staphylomas and to myopic macular holes. Macular holes in eyes with high myopia have a lower proportion of successful repair than in emmetropic eyes and frequently require the use of the inverted ILM technique in which the ILM is folded over the hole prior to fluid gas exchange. In addition, in eyes with high myopia macular holes may lead to extensive or complete ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment (see Chapter&#160;16, Fig 16-20&#160;in this volume).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Traction appears to affect the ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels in pathologic myopia. The ret&#173;i&#173;nal vessels can straighten, particularly the maculopapillary bundle, with occasional microaneurysm formation, and &#173;there can be a slight elevation of the arcade vessels. Paravascular cavitations and lamellar holes may also be found, but &#173;these defects do not appear to have any clinically meaningful effect.</p>
			<p class="h2">Bruch Membrane</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Located between the RPE and the choriocapillaris, Bruch membrane forms early in the development of the eye and appears to undergo varying amounts of remodeling over time. However, this may not be true in eyes with more advanced amounts of myopia. In &#173;these eyes, the Bruch membrane opening shifts so that the nasal portion of the optic nerve head is undermined by Bruch membrane. The nerve fibers must course around the nasal portion of the Bruch membrane opening; this has been referred to as “supertraction” or “supertraction crescent.” Corresponding temporal displacement of the posterior part of Bruch membrane opening is related to the myopic macular crescent typically located on the temporal side of the optic nerve. The lack of choroidal circulation in this region creates a white appearance due to the visualization of the sclera.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular expansion puts stress on Bruch membrane, potentially leading to fine ruptures called <span class="italic">lacquer cracks.</span> The outer lamella of Bruch membrane is the basement membrane of the choriocapillaris. The cracks disrupt not only the avascular membrane, but may also rupture the capillaries in the choriocapillaris, resulting in subret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhages. &#173;These hemorrhages can be difficult to differentiate from &#173;those caused by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which is discussed in the following section. Lacquer cracks offer a region of ingress for CNV (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-3</span>). Extension of lacquer cracks through the center of the fovea can cause distortion and loss of visual acuity. If many lacquer cracks develop, a region of pigmentary granularity can form. In late-&#173;stage myopic degeneration, large dehiscences in Bruch membrane may occur.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-1">Choroidal Neovascularization</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">An impor&#173;tant pathologic change common to eyes with pathologic myopia is the development of CNV. Early manifestations of CNV in pathologic myopia include decreased or distorted vision. The clinical findings include subret&#173;i&#173;nal hemorrhage, elevation and infiltration of the outer ret&#173;ina by vascular invasion, accumulation of subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid, and a localized area of pigmentary change. It is easy to overlook the findings of CNV in highly myopic eyes using ophthalmoscopy alone.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The size and apparent exudation of CNV appears to vary inversely with the amount of myopia. Myopic CNV does not cause ret&#173;i&#173;nal edema as commonly as age-&#173;related macular degeneration does. Myopic CNV is often seen in close association with lacquer cracks, or it may occur as an extension from a region of chorioret&#173;i&#173;nal atrophy. In the United States, it is not uncommon to find CNV in young myopic &#173;women who show signs of multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis, &#173;either at the time or &#173;later. &#173;These eyes may develop damage from the CNV, from inflammation, or from both; each component requires careful treatment. Myopic CNV was first treated with thermal &#173;laser photocoagulation and then &#173;later treated with photodynamic therapy, but both approaches &#173;were suboptimal. The advent of injections of anti–&#173;vascular endothelial growth &#173;factor (anti-&#173;VEGF) agents was a major advance; this treatment caused regression of the neovascularization without causing immediate collateral damage (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-4</span>). To control the CNV, episodic reinjection of medi&#173;cations may be necessary. Some patients may need frequent reinjections, including patients with CNV developing at the edge of a staphyloma or with untreated multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis. With or without treatment, CNV in pathologic myopia may become hyperpigmented; this lesion is called a Fuchs spot. With longer follow-up, areas of atrophy often develop at or adjacent to the pigmented lesions, and the atrophy eventually encompasses the central macula.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">The Choroid in Pathologic Myopia</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">More than 70% of the blood flow to the eye goes to the choroid, a structure that provides oxygen to the choroid, RPE, and the outer ret&#173;ina in addition to acting as a heat sink, absorbing stray light, participating in immune response and host defense, and acting as an integral part in the pro&#173;cess of emmetropization. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), particularly &#173;either swept-&#173;source OCT (SS-&#173;OCT) or enhanced depth imaging OCT (EDI-&#173;OCT) using spectral-&#173;domain OCT (SD-&#173;OCT), can image the full thickness of the choroid in myopic eyes.</p>
			<p class="body-text">One study found that the mean subfoveal choroid thickness in &#173;children aged 11–12&#160;years was 369 <span class="symbol">±</span>81 µm in girls and 348 <span class="symbol">±</span> 72 <span class="greek">μ</span>m in boys. With increasing age, the choroid becomes thinner; for example, the typical subfoveal choroidal thickness in an emmetropic 60-&#173;year-&#173;old might be approximately 220–260 µm. Eyes with myopia, particularly &#173;those progressing into the range of pathologic myopia, undergo ocular expansion starting in late childhood, and this expansion is also associated with thinning of the choroid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-5</span>). A group of patients with myopia with a mean age of 59.7&#160;years had&#160;a mean refractive error of –11.9 D and a mean subfoveal choroidal thickness of 93 µm, with a relatively large standard deviation of 63 µm. The thinning of the choroid per de&#173;cade of life is approximately the same in myopic eyes as in nonmyopic eyes. Therefore, older individuals, or individuals with higher amounts of myopia, may have remarkably thin choroids. The most significant predictor of visual acuity in highly myopic eyes with no macular pathology is subfoveal choroidal thickness. Eyes with pathologic myopia have many reasons to lose visual acuity, and some of &#173;these are quite dramatic, such as ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment. However, &#173;later in life many more highly myopic eyes suffer smaller amounts of visual acuity loss associated with decreasing choroidal thickness.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When the choroid becomes very thin, the pigmentation of the RPE often becomes granular. The larger choroidal vessels, or what is left of them, are easily vis&#173;i&#173;ble. The choroid may show a repeating pattern of pigmentation, blood vessel, pigmentation, blood vessel and so on in a pattern known as a <span class="italic">tessellation</span>. Eventually the choroid may become so thin that the choroidal tissue and the overlying RPE are no longer supported (<span class="xref-figure">Fig&#160;10-6</span>). This produces ovoid areas of white, called patchy atrophy, in which the under&#173;lying sclera is shown. If the central macula is involved, the patient’s visual acuity &#173;will be poor. In eyes with larger areas of atrophy, even Bruch membrane can rupture, leaving a truly bare sclera.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Around the optic nerve, between 5% and 10% of highly myopic eyes &#173;will have a yellow-&#173;orange pocket, which was at one time thought to be a localized ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment, but more refined OCT imaging revealed it to be an acquired cavitation in the choroid (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-7</span>). Therefore, &#173;these lesions are called <span class="italic">peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitations.</span> EDI-OCT demonstrated that &#173;these cavitations are associated with a posterior bowing of the sclera around the nerve.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">The Sclera</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top3">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The thickness of the sclera in a nonmyopic eye varies considerably with location; the thickest area, which is around the optic nerve, can be slightly more than 1&#160;mm, whereas the area immediately &#173;under the rectus muscle insertions may be as thin as 0.3&#160;mm. When ocular expansion related to myopia begins, the eye elongates, but the amount of material that makes up the sclera does not increase (see Fig 10-1). The collagen fibers become thinner, the typical gradient in fiber thickness in the sclera is lost, and the amount of extracellular matrix decreases. Over time, the sclera in a myopic eye shows more elasticity and greater viscoelastic creep. &#173;These &#173;factors appear to be necessary to allow the myopic eye to expand, but why it expands is unknown.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Form-&#173;deprivation or lens-&#173;induced errors in the eye are followed by axial length changes in animal models. Optic nerve sectioning or the destruction of the ciliary nerve does not prevent the development of experimental myopia. Form deprivation of a hemifield results in expansion of the eye that is conjugate with that hemifield, even if the optic nerve is sectioned. &#173;These findings support the hypothesis that remodeling of the eye results from local effects within the eye, beginning with signaling that originates in the ret&#173;ina and choroid and eventually affects the sclera. Connection to the brain does not appear to be necessary. Eyes that develop axial myopia lengthen, but in comparison to the posterior pole, the periphery becomes relatively hyperopic. Peripheral hyperopia can induce myopia in animal models, and curiously myopia can develop in eyes with peripheral hyperopia even if the posterior portion of the ret&#173;ina has been destroyed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Ocular expansion can vary regionally, inducing formation of areas of the sclera that have differing radii of curvature. A regional expansion of the eye that produces a protrusion is called a staphyloma. &#173;These protrusions follow several patterns, but typically involve 3 general areas of the eye: (1) the area around the nerve, (2) the macular region, which leads to exaggerated thinning of the choroid and possibly myopic traction maculopathy, and (3) the inferior or inferotemporal portion of the eye (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-8</span>). The superior portion of the eye has one radius of curvature while the inferior portion has another, and &#173;there is a vis&#173;i&#173;ble boundary between &#173;these two curves. If the boundary occurs above the optic nerve, the optic nerve head &#173;will appear grossly tilted and rotated. If the boundary bisects the fovea, several alterations may be seen. In &#173;later life, &#173;there may be atrophy along the boundary line that affects the RPE &#173;under the fovea, and &#173;either subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid without CNV or frank CNV may also develop in &#173;these eyes. &#173;Because this last staphyloma may be accompanied by a set of pos&#173;si&#173;ble ocular manifestations, it has been referred to as <span class="italic">inferior staphyloma syndrome</span> or <span class="italic">tilted disc syndrome.</span> The origin of the accumulation of subret&#173;i&#173;nal fluid without CNV is not known. In some patients, the choroid may show slight regional thickening around the change in curvature, but nearly all patients show a localized thickening of the sclera, which may limit outflow through the sclera (see Fig&#160;10-8).</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-5">The Optic Nerve</p>
			<div id="Chapt10_Top4">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In eyes with pathologic myopia, the optic nerve head is undercut by a shifted Bruch membrane opening, the scleral canal may be stretched and tilted, the circle of Zinn–&#173;Haller is greatly enlarged, and the optic nerve may ordinarily appear stretched and pallorous. Glaucoma is much more common in highly myopic eyes and frequently goes undetected. Mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the ret&#173;i&#173;nal nerve fiber layer with OCT is problematic &#173;because of the varying shape of the eye, the potential for schisis, and &#173;because normative databases &#173;were developed for eyes that are not pathologically myopic. Visual field tests may show defects &#173;because of the shape of the eye, some of which can be “fixed” by using a refractive correction for that portion of the eye. Dehiscences in the lamina cribrosa are common in eyes with high myopia. (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 10-9</span>).</p>
