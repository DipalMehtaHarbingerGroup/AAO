			<p class="h1first">Electrophysiologic Testing</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Most electrophysiologic tests use evoked potential techniques in which a controlled stimulus is used to evoke an electrophysiologic response. Dif&#173;fer&#173;ent techniques can be used to assess the function of the majority of the visual system, extending from the ret&#173;i&#173;nal pigment epithelium (RPE) to the primary visual cortex. Dysfunction discovered at one level usually signals abnormalities in another; for example, an abnormal cortical response to a pattern visual stimulus could reflect an uncorrected refractive error, maculopathy, optic neuropathy, primary dysfunction of the posterior visual pathways, or other conditions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Electrophysiologic testing provides objective mea&#173;sures of visual system function, which are interpreted in conjunction with structural imaging data; normal structure should not be assumed to mean normal function. In addition, in order to accurately interpret the data obtained during electrophysiologic testing, the clinician needs to know the origin of the signals to be able to relate the findings from a par&#173;tic&#173;u&#173;lar patient’s test to the under&#173;lying pathophysiology. Although this chapter does not provide instructions for a comprehensive diagnostic review, the princi&#173;ples of localization in the examples included &#173;here may be applicable to other disorders. In addition to diagnostic uses, electrophysiologic data are used in objective monitoring, &#173;either of disease progression or the efficacy of treatment, or as both an outcome mea&#173;sure and an index of safety in the evaluation of novel therapeutic interventions.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A thorough patient history and careful ophthalmic examination helps the clinician determine the most appropriate tests to employ; &#173;those tests should then be performed using standardized protocols. The International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) publishes minimum standards for performing the routine tests, thus enabling meaningful interlaboratory comparison and lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture searches. Many laboratories, particularly &#173;those with a strong research interest, use more complex test protocols but also always include the standard responses. The International Federation for Clinical Neuro&#173;physiology has also published guidelines for visual system testing, which incorporate suggested test protocols based on patient symptoms.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-1">Electroretinography</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top1">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The clinical electroretinogram (ERG) mea&#173;sures a massed electrical response from the ret&#173;ina, usually evoked by a brief flash of light. ERGs are usually recorded using active electrodes that contact the bulbar conjunctiva, with reference electrodes at the outer canthi. The active electrodes can be contact lens electrodes, although gold foil electrodes, H-&#173;K loop electrodes, and DTL fiber electrodes are also commonly used. The 3 main types of electroretinogram—&#173;the full-&#173;field (Ganzfeld) electroretinogram (ERG), the multifocal ERG (mfERG), and the pattern ERG (PERG)—&#173;are discussed in the following sections.</p>
			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Full-&#173;Field (Ganzfeld) ERG</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">In full-&#173;field ERG, a Ganzfeld bowl uniformly illuminates the entire ret&#173;ina with a full-&#173;field luminance stimulus; the Ganzfeld also provides a uniform background for photopic adaptation and photopic ERG recording. Regular calibration of flash strength is required for clinical accuracy. <span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;3-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">1</span> shows typical ERG responses, but normal values vary with recording techniques, and each laboratory must establish its own normative data. Even with standardization, variations in the type of electrode and specific equipment &#173;will affect the test results.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Most laboratories dark-&#173;adapt the patient while the pupils are dilating, position the corneal electrodes &#173;under dim red light, and then commence stimulation using an interstimulus interval sufficient to allow the ret&#173;ina to recover between flashes (from 2 seconds for low intensities up to 20 seconds for high intensities). Many laboratories rec&#173;ord responses to a series of increasing stimulus strengths. The patient is then light-&#173;adapted (using standardized background intensity and adaptation time), and photopic testing is performed, in which the stimuli are delivered &#173;under rod-&#173;suppressing background illumination.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ISCEV standard full-&#173;field ERG consists of 6 dif&#173;fer&#173;ent responses (see Fig 3-1). Nomenclature is based on the flash strength as mea&#173;sured in cd s/m<span class="superscript _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> (candela-&#173;seconds per square meter) and the adaptive state of the eye (ie, dark-&#173;adapted [DA] or light-&#173;adapted [LA]). Older terms are given in parentheses in the following list. Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment of the ERG focuses on the size and timing of the major components, as indicated in Figure&#160;3-1.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-first ParaOverride-3">1.&#9;<span class="italic">DA 0.01 (rod</span>-&#173;<span class="italic">specific):</span> In this response, a b-&#173;wave arises in the on-&#173;bipolar cells (BPCs) (inner nuclear layer) of the rod system. A reduction in this response identifies dysfunction within the rod system, but, as it arises at an inner ret&#173;i&#173;nal level, this response cannot differentiate between dysfunction at the level of the photoreceptor and inner ret&#173;i&#173;nal dysfunction. It therefore acts as a mea&#173;sure of rod system sensitivity.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">2.&#9;<span class="italic">DA 3.0 (mixed rod–&#173;cone):</span> This response consists of an a-&#173;wave and a b-&#173;wave. The a-&#173;wave at this flash strength usually has 2 peaks between approximately 15 and 21 milliseconds (ms), &#173;either of which may be prominent. &#173;Because only approximately the first 8 ms of the DA a-&#173;wave reflects photoreceptor hyperpolarization, the ISCEV standard now includes additional brighter flash testing for better &#173;diagnostic specificity.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">3.&#9;<span class="italic">DA 10.0/30.0:</span> At &#173;either of &#173;these flash strengths, the a-&#173;wave has an easily mea&#173;sur&#173;able peak, and most of the a-&#173;wave reflects photoreceptor function. This response can therefore localize dysfunction &#173;either to a photoreceptor or inner-&#173;retinal level. Thus, a reduced DA 0.01 response accompanied by marked reduction in the <br />a-&#173;wave of the DA 10.0/30.0 response indicates photoreceptor dysfunction; however, if the a-&#173;wave amplitude is normal or near-&#173;normal and the b-&#173;wave amplitude is lower than the a-&#173;wave (known as a negative or electronegative ERG waveform), then dysfunction occurs post-&#173;phototransduction, at an inner-&#173;retinal level.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">4.&#9;<span class="italic">Oscillatory potentials:</span> &#173;These small oscillations on the ascending limb of the b-&#173;wave prob&#173;ably arise largely in the amacrine cells and can be made more vis&#173;i&#173;ble by filtering. They are reduced in ret&#173;i&#173;nal ischemic states and in most cases of congenital stationary night blindness but overall have limited diagnostic value.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-mid">5.&#9;<span class="italic">LA 3.0 (photopic single-&#173;flash):</span> This ERG is obtained by stimulating with a flash superimposed upon a rod-&#173;suppressing background. The a-&#173;wave relates to function in the cone photoreceptors and off-&#173;BPCs. The b-&#173;wave arises as a synchronized component in on-&#173; and off-&#173;BPCs. This response thus enables some localization of cone-&#173;system dysfunction.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list-last">6.&#9;<span class="italic">LA 3.0 30&#160;Hz (photopic flicker):</span> The temporal resolution of the rod system is poor, and this response arises in the cone system. It is the more sensitive mea&#173;sure of cone-&#173;system dysfunction but allows no anatomical specificity. Both timing and amplitude are impor&#173;tant par&#173;ameters; delay in the flicker ERG response is a sensitive mea&#173;sure of generalized ret&#173;i&#173;nal cone system dysfunction, whereas reduced amplitude but normal peak time usually indicates restricted loss of function.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A number of &#173;factors influence the size and timing of a normal ERG response, including pupil size; pupil dia&#173;meter should always be mea&#173;sured. ERG amplitude declines with age, and age-&#173;related controls are needed. Newborns have small ERGs with simplified waveforms. The responses mature rapidly, reaching adult values in the first year of life. The ERG is relatively insensitive to refractive error; highly myopic eyes have lower amplitude ERGs but without the peak-&#173;time delay usually associated with inherited ret&#173;i&#173;nal degeneration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As a biological signal, ERGs have inherent noise. If amplitudes remain within the reference range (“normal range”) a reduction over time of more than 25% is usually considered significant. For peak-&#173;time mea&#173;sures, a change greater than 3 ms is regarded as significant for cone-&#173;derived response a-&#173; or b-&#173;waves and brighter-&#173;flash dark-&#173;adapted a-&#173;waves, and a change greater than 6 ms is significant for dark-&#173;adapted b-&#173;waves.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In general, ERG peak-&#173;time shift suggests generalized dysfunction, whereas &#173;simple amplitude reduction suggests restricted loss of function such as may occur in a partial ret&#173;i&#173;nal detachment (loss of function in the detached area of ret&#173;ina but normal function in the attached ret&#173;ina), branch vascular occlusion, regional uveitic damage, or restricted (“sector”) forms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Timing is often best assessed using the &#173;30-&#173;Hz flicker ERG peak time. Generalized inflammatory disease, such as posterior uveitis, may be associated with delay but preservation of amplitude. Indeed, marked 30&#160;Hz flicker delay with a high amplitude almost always indicates an inflammatory etiology.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="xref-figure">Figure&#160;3-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">2 </span>pres&#173;ents examples of ERG patterns found in association with specific disorders. The full-&#173;field ERG is a mass response from the &#173;whole ret&#173;ina, and dysfunction confined to the macula is therefore accompanied by normal full-&#173;field ERG responses. Even though the central macula is cone-&#173;dense, the majority of ret&#173;i&#173;nal cones lie outside the macula; thus, the macula contributes &#173;little to a full-&#173;field ERG. &#173;Because abnormal photopic ERG responses indicate cone dysfunction outside the macula, ERG testing therefore helps the clinician distinguish between a macular dystrophy phenotype (normal ERG response) and a cone or cone–&#173;rod dystrophy phenotype (abnormal ERG response), which may have more serious visual implications for the patient. For example, <span class="italic">ABCA4</span> retinopathy (eg, Stargardt disease; fundus flavimaculatus) can, in some patients, be associated with severe generalized cone and rod system dysfunction. If the full-&#173;field ERGs of the patient are normal at pre&#173;sen&#173;ta&#173;tion, the dysfunction is confined to the macula and has prognostic value: 80% of such patients &#173;will still have normal full-&#173;field ERG responses at 10-&#173;year follow up.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Multifocal ERG</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The multifocal ERG (mfERG) can produce a topographic ERG map of central ret&#173;i&#173;nal cone-&#173;system function, which can help the clinician diagnose macular dysfunction and assess the extent of central ret&#173;i&#173;nal involvement in generalized ret&#173;i&#173;nal disease (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-3</span>). The stimulus consists of multiple hexagons, smaller in the center than the periphery to reflect cone photoreceptor density, each of which flashes with a pseudorandom sequence. Cross-&#173;correlation techniques are used to calculate the small ERGs corresponding to each hexagon. Overall stimulus field size is usually approximately 50°. For patients with stable and accurate fixation (essential for obtaining technically satisfactory and clinically meaningful results), mfERG can objectively determine the spatial distribution of macular dysfunction. The mfERG is less sensitive than the pattern ERG for disorders such as cystoid macular edema, in which primary photoreceptor dysfunction is not the main pathophysiological feature; mfERG and PERG can provide complementary information. Clinicians have increasingly used mfERG in the diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine toxicity (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-4</span>). &#173;There may be relative sparing of the response to the central foveal hexagon with involvement of the responses to the ring of surrounding hexagons; a ring analy&#173;sis may be beneficial. However, it should be noted that recently it has been demonstrated that Asian patients may show an extra-&#173;macular pattern of damage, which would not be detected by mfERG.</p>

			<p class="h2 ParaOverride-2">Pattern ERG</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The pattern ERG (PERG) is the ret&#173;i&#173;nal response to an isoluminant alternating checkerboard stimulus presented to the macula. The stimulus is thus primarily alternating contrast. The responses are small, and signal averaging is needed. However, when technical &#173;factors are considered, PERG reliability is similar to full-&#173;field ERG. &#173;There are 2 main components, P50 and N95, with most subjects showing an earlier negative component, N35. N95 arises in the ret&#173;i&#173;nal ganglion cells (RGCs) and thus acts as a direct mea&#173;sure of central RGC function. The P50 component depends upon macular photoreceptor function, even though approximately 70% of it arises in the RGCs; the amplitude of P50 is clinically useful as an objective index of macular function. The image must be in focus on the macula, and PERGs are recorded with electrodes that spare the optics of the eye; contact lens electrodes are not suitable. &#173;Because the PERG is evoked by a stimulus similar to that used in recording the visual evoked potential (VEP) (discussed &#173;later in this chapter), knowledge of the PERG helps the clinician provide a more accurate interpretation of abnormal VEP findings. PERG is also useful in diagnosing primary ganglion cell disease such as dominantly inherited optic atrophy or Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.</p>

			<p class="h2">Clinical Considerations</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The ERG provides objective ret&#173;i&#173;nal functional data and is therefore impor&#173;tant in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of ret&#173;i&#173;nal disease. Symptomatic indications include night blindness, in which the potentially blinding rod–&#173;cone dystrophies must be distinguished from the relatively benign congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). The dystrophies are associated with markedly abnormal a-&#173;waves in the dark-&#173;adapted bright-&#173;flash ERGs; CSNB is usually associated with a normal a-&#173;wave and a “negative” ERG waveform (see Fig 3-2). Other symptomatic indications include photophobia, which indicates generalized cone dysfunction (as in cone dystrophy), and photopsia or shimmering, which can sometimes signal the development of autoimmune retinopathy, possibly paraneoplastic. The ERG is increasingly used in the assessment and monitoring of inflammatory disorders such as birdshot chorioretinopathy; objective functional data allow clinicians to make management decisions with more confidence. The ERG facilitates an objective assessment of disease severity, aiding in decisions on when and how to treat; following treatment, it provides a valuable mea&#173;sure of treatment efficacy that is more sensitive than conventional clinical par&#173;ameters.</p>
			<p class="body-text">ERGs must always be taken in a clinical context, and to enable accurate ERG diagnosis, a careful clinical history should include previous drug and/or surgical treatment as well as a &#173;family history. Results are diagnostic (pathognomonic) only for 3 relatively rare inherited disorders: bradyopsia (mutation in <span class="italic">RGS9</span> or <span class="italic">R9AP</span>), enhanced S-&#173;cone syndrome (<span class="italic">NR2E3),</span> and “cone dystrophy with supernormal rod ERG” <span class="italic">(KCNV2).</span></p>
			<p class="body-text">The ERG can be useful in assessing patients with vascular disease. In patients with central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery occlusion (CRAO), the ERG is characteristically negative, reflecting the dual blood supply to the ret&#173;i&#173;na; the photoreceptors are supplied via choroidal circulation, but the central ret&#173;i&#173;nal artery supplies the inner nuclear layer. Thus, the b-&#173;wave amplitude is reduced but the a-&#173;wave is relatively preserved. In eyes with central ret&#173;i&#173;nal vein occlusion (CRVO), a negative ERG or delay in the 30-&#173;Hz flicker response suggests significant ischemia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The ERG can also be helpful in determining the carrier state of individuals with <br />X-&#173;linked disease. For example, carriers of X-&#173;linked RP usually have abnormal ERG findings that reflect lyonization, even with a healthy-&#173;appearing fundus. However, in choroideremia, carriers usually exhibit a normal ERG response despite an abnormal fundus appearance (also resulting from lyonization).</p>
			<p class="body-text">Electroretinography is suitable for use with &#173;children of all ages, providing objective functional data for patients who may not be able to describe their symptoms. In addition, the ERG may reveal ret&#173;i&#173;nal abnormalities prior to the development of fundus abnormalities. For young subjects, sedation, general anesthesia, or eyelid electrodes may be used. The latter are usually well tolerated and require neither sedation nor anesthesia. Interpretation of pediatric ERGs involves special considerations. Adult ERG values are not reached &#173;until 6–9 months of age, and, if general anesthesia is used, the effect of the anesthetic on the ERG must be considered.</p>

			<p class="h1 ParaOverride-4">Electro-oculography</p>
			<div id="Chapt3_Top2">
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The electro-&#173;oculogram (EOG) assesses the health of the RPE and its interaction with the photoreceptors by mea&#173;sur&#173;ing the corneo-&#173;retinal standing potential during dark adaptation (DA) and light adaptation (LA). The standing potential, which reflects the voltage differential across the RPE, is positive at the cornea (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-5</span>). Estimates of trans-&#173;RPE potential range from 1 to 10 mV.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For an EOG test, the patient makes fixed 30° lateral eye movements for approximately 10 seconds each minute during 15 minutes of DA, and again during a 12-&#173;minute period of LA (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">6</span>). The amplitude of the signal recorded between electrodes positioned at medial and lateral canthi reaches a minimum &#173;after approximately 12 minutes of DA—&#173;the dark trough—&#173;and a maximum at approximately 8 minutes of LA—&#173;the light peak. The ratio between the amplitude of the light peak to the dark trough is expressed as a percentage (the <span class="italic">Arden index</span> or <span class="italic">ratio</span>). A normal light rise &#173;will be greater than 170% and requires normally functioning photoreceptors in contact with a normally functioning RPE. The light peak reflects progressive depolarization of the RPE basal membrane via mechanisms that are not fully understood; however, the protein bestrophin is implicated in the final opening of chloride channels.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Any disorder of rod photoreceptor function &#173;will affect an EOG, and the light rise is typically severely reduced in an EOG of any widespread photoreceptor degeneration, including RP. However, the EOG is principally used in clinical practice in the diagnosis of bestrophin mutations (see <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;13</span>) and AZOOR (acute zonal occult outer retino&#173;pathy). In patients with Best disease, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by mutations in <span class="italic">BEST1</span>, a severely reduced or absent EOG light rise is accompanied by a normal ERG response. Severe loss of the EOG light rise is also seen in patients with autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB). ARB is a recessively inherited progressive ret&#173;i&#173;nal dystrophy and, unlike Best disease, requires biallelic mutation. Affected patients have abnormal ERG responses, but not sufficiently abnormal to explain the degree of EOG response abnormality. Also unlike Best disease, ARB carriers do not show an EOG response abnormality. The EOG findings in patients with adult vitelliform macular dystrophy may be mildly subnormal, but they are not as reduced as much as in Best disease.</p>

The signals are recorded via electrodes placed on the occipital scalp. The VEP is extracted from the larger background electroencephalogram by averaging the responses to multiple reversals or flashes. Pattern-&#173;reversal VEPs (the black-&#173;and-&#173;white squares interchange without change in luminance) have a similar waveform across a population and a remarkably consistent timing; amplitudes show greater variability. Flash VEPs are far more variable across a population but can be useful when comparing eyes or hemispheric responses in the same patient; hemispheric comparison requires multiple recording channels. A normal pattern-&#173;reversal VEP (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">7</span>) contains a major positive component at approximately 100 ms, P100. Mea&#173;sure&#173;ment is usually taken of P100 amplitude and peak time (sometimes called <span class="italic">latency</span>).</p>
			<p class="body-text">In adults, VEPs are often used to demonstrate optic nerve conduction delay, particularly in patients with suspected multiple sclerosis; patients with demyelinating optic neuritis almost invariably show VEP delay even when visual acuity recovers (see Fig&#160;3-7). However, &#173;there can be subclinical delay in patients without any history or signs of optic neuropathy. Most optic nerve diseases show VEP delay, but an abnormality can be confined to amplitude (interocular asymmetry), for example, in patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. VEPs are crucial in patients with medically unexplained vision loss when the vision loss is suspected to be nonorganic. VEPs can objectively demonstrate normal function in the presence of symptoms that suggest other&#173;wise. It is impor&#173;tant to note that a delayed VEP is not diagnostic of optic nerve disease. Macular dysfunction can cause similarly abnormal findings, and assessment of macular function with mfERG or PERG enables improved VEP interpretation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">VEPs are indispensable in examining &#173;children, particularly &#173;those who are preverbal, who have apparent vision loss, or who pres&#173;ent in infancy with roving eye movements or unexplained nystagmus. VEPs are used in conjunction with ERGs to discover any ret&#173;i&#173;nal or post-&#173;retinal dysfunction. However, caution must be exercised in any patient with nystagmus &#173;because that eye movement disorder can itself induce abnormal responses.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Pattern-&#173;appearance stimulation, in which the stimulus appears from a uniformly gray background and then dis&#173;appears, maintaining isoluminance throughout, can also be used to elicit VEPs. VEPs recorded in this manner are particularly useful in demonstrating the intracranial misrouting associated with ocular or oculocutaneous albinism (requiring multiple recording channels) &#173;because they are less affected by nystagmus than reversal VEPs. Flash stimulation is effective for babies and infants who cannot maintain adequate fixation on a pattern stimulus. If the check size and contrast levels are varied, pattern-&#173;appearance VEPs can also be used to objectively assess visual system resolution, providing a surrogate mea&#173;sure of visual acuity.</p>

			<p class="h2">Color Vision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">A healthy &#173;human ret&#173;ina has 3 cone types, each containing a dif&#173;fer&#173;ent outer segment visual pigment: short-&#173;wavelength sensitive (S cone; formerly, <span class="italic">blue</span>), medium-&#173;wavelength sensitive (M cone; formerly, <span class="italic">green</span>), and long-&#173;wavelength sensitive (L cone; formerly, <span class="italic">red</span>) cones. The integrative cells in the ret&#173;ina and higher visual centers are or&#173;ga&#173;nized primarily to recognize <span class="italic">contrasts</span> between light or colors, and the receptive fields of color-&#173;sensitive cells typically have regions that compare the intensity of red versus green or blue versus yellow.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The classification and the testing of dysfunctional color vision are based upon this contrast-&#173;recognition physiology. Red-&#173;green color deficiency, which is common in males through X-&#173;linked inheritance (6%–8% incidence), is traditionally separated into protan and deutan types, referring to absent or defective long-&#173;wavelength–&#173;sensitive or medium-&#173;wavelength–&#173;sensitive pigment, respectively. &#173;These distinctions have value in terms of patients’ perception, even though individuals with normal color vision often have a duplication of pigment genes, and individuals with color-&#173;vision deficiency may not have single or &#173;simple gene defects. Blue-&#173;yellow color deficiency is rarely inherited and can be an impor&#173;tant early marker for acquired disease. Inherited color vision defects are described in <span class="xref-local">Chapter&#160;12</span>.</p>
			<p class="h3">Testing of color vision</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The most accurate instrument for classifying congenital red-&#173;green color defects is the <span class="italic">anomaloscope,</span> but it is not widely used. The patient views a split screen and is asked to match the yellow appearance of one half by mixing varying proportions of red and green light in the other half. Individuals with red-&#173;green color deficiency use abnormal proportions of red and green to make the match.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The most common tests of color vision use colored tablets or diagrams. &#173;These tests must be performed in appropriate lighting, usually illumination that mimics sunlight. Pseudoisochromatic plates, such as the <span class="italic">Ishihara</span> plates (which assess color discrimination along protan [red] and deutan [green] axes only) and <span class="italic">Hardy-&#173;Rand-&#173;Rittler</span> plates (which also assess the tritan [blue] axis), pres&#173;ent colored numbers or figures against a background of colored dots (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">8</span>). The colors of both figure and background are selected from hues that are difficult for a color-&#173;deficient person to distinguish. Individuals with defective color vision see &#173;either no pattern at all or an alternative pattern based on brightness rather than hue. &#173;These tests are quick to perform and sensitive for screening color vision, but they are not effective in classifying the deficiency.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Panel tests, including the Farnsworth-&#173;Munsell 100 and the Farnsworth Panel D-15 hue tests, are more accurate in classifying color deficiency. The <span class="italic">Farnsworth-&#173;Munsell 100-&#173;</span><span class="italic">hue test</span> is very sensitive &#173;because the difference in hues between adjacent tablets approximates the minimum that a typical observer can distinguish (1–4&#160;nm). The spectrum is divided into 4 parts of 25 colored tablets each, and the patient is asked to discriminate between subtle shades of similar colors. However, the test is tiring and time-&#173;consuming.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Consisting of only 15 colored tablets, the <span class="italic">Farnsworth Panel D</span>-&#173;<span class="italic">15 test</span> (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-</span>&#173;<span class="xref-figure">9</span>) is quicker and more con&#173;ve&#173;nient for routine clinical use. The hues are more saturated, and they cover the spectrum so that patients &#173;will confuse colors for which they have deficient perception (such as red and green). The patient is asked to arrange the tablets in sequence, and errors can be quickly plotted to define the color deficiency. The D-15 test may miss mildly affected individuals, but it is still deemed useful &#173;because of its speed. The relative insensitivity may also be an asset in judging the practical significance of mild degrees of color deficiency. For example, individuals who fail the Ishihara plates but pass the D-15 test &#173;will prob&#173;ably not have color discrimination prob&#173;lems &#173;under most circumstances and in most occupations. Desaturated versions of the D-15 test, such as the L’Anthony D-15, which recognize more subtle degrees of color deficiency, are perhaps more clinically useful.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Individuals with major congenital color deficiencies typically show a distinct protan or deutan pattern on the D-15 scoring graph, whereas &#173;those with acquired optic nerve or ret&#173;i&#173;nal disease show an irregular pattern of errors. Tritan axis errors (blue-&#173;yellow confusion), which usually signify acquired disease, are readily detected using the D-15 test. Enlarged versions (PV-16 tests) are available for testing patients with reduced visual acuity.</p>

Philadelphia: Saunders; 2008:chap 123.</p>
			<p class="h2">Contrast Sensitivity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-"><span class="italic">Contrast sensitivity</span> (CS) is a very impor&#173;tant concept to understand. The loss of CS often results in visual difficulties and dysfunction out of proportion to the patient’s mea&#173;sured visual acuity. For example, patients with nonexudative macular degeneration or diabetic macular edema may have good mea&#173;sured visual acuity of 20/30 or better but report &#173;experiencing difficulty when performing routine visual tasks such as reading the newspaper or navigating stairways. &#173;Because a conventional Snellen visual acuity is based on high-&#173;contrast, achromatic, square-&#173;wave stimuli, it does not mea&#173;sure the patient’s ability to perceive the subtleties of light. However, the visual system codes much of what is seen based on <span class="italic">contrast</span> rather than spatial resolution, with subtleties of light and dark providing most of the richness of visual perception. For example, when dusk, fog, or smoke reduce contrast, it becomes very difficult for anyone to resolve ordinary objects. Similarly, when patients become unable to perceive contrast &#173;under ordinary conditions, for example as a result of many ret&#173;i&#173;nal diseases or from media opacities, visual function is adversely impacted.</p>
			<p class="h3">Testing of contrast sensitivity</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">Several clinical tests of CS are available. Most relate CS to <span class="italic">spatial frequency,</span> which refers to the size of the light–&#173;dark cycles. Individuals are typically most sensitive to contrast for objects that have a spatial frequency between 2 and 5 cycles per degree (<span class="xref-figure">Fig 3-10</span>), but this sensitivity can change in patients with disease. Some tests use letters or optotypes of varying dimness and size to provide a more clinical context.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <span class="italic">Pelli-&#173;Robson test</span> mea&#173;sures contrast sensitivity using a single, large letter size (20/60 optotype), with contrast varying across groups of letters. Patients read the letters, starting with the highest contrast, and continue &#173;until they are unable to read 2 or 3 &#173;letters in a single group. The subject is assigned a score based on the contrast of the last group in which 2 or 3 letters &#173;were correctly read. The Pelli-&#173;Robson score is a logarithmic mea&#173;sure of the subject’s contrast sensitivity. Thus, a score of 2 means that the subject could read at least 2 of the 3 letters with a contrast of 1% (contrast sensitivity <span class="symbol">=</span> 100%, or log<span class="subscript CharOverride-1">10</span> 2). That is, a score of 2.0 indicates normal contrast sensitivity of 100%. A Pelli-&#173;Robson contrast sensitivity score of less than 1.5 is consistent with visual impairment, and a score of less than 1.0 represents visual disability (see Fig 3-10).</p>

			<p class="h2">Dark Adaptometry</p>
			<p class="body-text--no-indent-">The sensitivity of the &#173;human eye extends over a range of 10–11 log<span class="subscript _idGenCharOverride-1">10</span> units. Cones and rods adapt to dif&#173;fer&#173;ent levels of background light through neural mechanisms and through the bleaching and regeneration of visual pigments. Clinical dark adaptometry primarily mea&#173;sures the absolute thresholds of cone and rod sensitivity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Dark adaptation can be mea&#173;sured and quantified with the <span class="italic">Goldmann-&#173;Weekers (G-&#173;W) adaptometer; </span>however, it is neither widely available or used. Although newer instruments have been introduced, they have yet to gain widespread ac&#173;cep&#173;tance, and the majority of the research lit&#173;er&#173;a&#173;ture is devoted to the G-&#173;W.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Dark adaptometry is useful in assessing patients with night blindness. Although it is a subjective test, dark adaptometry can complement the ERG; as a <span class="italic">focal test</span> (relevant when interpreting results from patients with local rather than generalized ret&#173;i&#173;nal dysfunction), it can be a more sensitive indicator of pathology than the ERG, especially early in the disease pro&#173;cess. Dark adaptometry can also demonstrate the degree of cone adaptation in the evaluation of cone dysfunction syndromes.</p>
